EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SCALANCE LPE 4903 and SINUMERIK Edge* **Vulnerability:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Write2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to escalate privileges and gain administrative rights.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products and versions are affected:* SCALANCE LPE9403: All versions prior to v2\\.0* SINUMERIK Edge: All versions prior to v3\\.3\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) A local privilege escalation vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft environment variables and execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed, the attack can cause a local privilege escalation, giving unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.[CVE\\-2021\\-4034](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-4034)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users update products to the following versions:* SCALANCE LPE9403: [Update to v2\\.0 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811123/)  .* SINUMERIK Edge: Update to v3\\.3\\.0 or later using the product\u2019s internal update mechanism. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Restrict system access to authorized personnel and follow a least privilege approach* Temporary mitigation exists at the expense of pkexec\u2019s capabilities. By removing SUID permissions, the program cannot run processes as root. However, any processes that rely on it for normal operation will be affected\t+ SUID permission can be removed with chmod, as follows: chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals.
