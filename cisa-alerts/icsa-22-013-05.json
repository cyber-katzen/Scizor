MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released an update for COMOS and recommends users update to the latest version:**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * COMOS v10\\.3: [Update to v10\\.3\\.3\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/109808862)  or later* COMOS v10\\.3 all versions prior to v10\\.3\\.3\\.3 (only if web components are used) (only affected by CVE\\-2021\\-37196\\): Currently no fix is planned**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * COMOS v10\\.4 (only if web components are used): [Update to v10\\.4\\.1](https://download.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/)  or later version Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* For COMOS v10\\.4\\.1 / v10\\.3\\.3\\.2\\.14 and CVE\\-2021\\-37194: Use the new whitelisting feature, to specify the filetypes that are allowed to be uploaded.* CVE\\-2021\\-37196 can be mitigated in all versions by making the root directory of the web server read only. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-995338](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-995338.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
