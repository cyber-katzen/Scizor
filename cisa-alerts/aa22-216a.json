[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity Advisory2021 Top Malware Strains======================== Last Revised August 25, 2022 Alert Code AA22\\-216A### Summary**Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to Protect Against Malware:**  \u2022 Patch all systems and prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  . \u2022 Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA). \u2022 Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other risky services. \u2022 Make offline backups of your data. \u2022 Provide end\\-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing. This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)  ) and the Australian Cyber Security Centre ( [ACSC](https://www.cyber.gov.au/)  ). This advisory provides details on the top malware strains observed in 2021\\. Malware, short for \u201cmalicious software,\u201d can compromise a system by performing an unauthorized function or process. Malicious cyber actors often use malware to covertly compromise and then gain access to a computer or mobile device. Some examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and rootkits.\\[ [1](/resources-tools/resources/malware-tip-card \"Malware Tip Card\")  ] In 2021, the top malware strains included remote access Trojans (RATs), banking Trojans, information stealers, and ransomware. Most of the top malware strains have been in use for more than five years with their respective code bases evolving into multiple variations. The most prolific malware users are cyber criminals, who use malware to deliver ransomware or facilitate theft of personal and financial information. CISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of this joint CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems, implementing user training, securing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), patching all systems especially for known exploited vulnerabilities, making offline backups of data, and enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA).

Updates made by malware developers, and reuse of code from these malware strains, contribute to the malware\u2019s longevity and evolution into multiple variations. Malicious actors\u2019 use of known malware strains offers organizations opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these known malware strains. The most prolific malware users of the top malware strains are cyber criminals, who use malware to deliver ransomware or facilitate theft of personal and financial information.* Qakbot and TrickBot are used to form botnets and are developed and operated by Eurasian cyber criminals known for using or brokering botnet\\-enabled access to facilitate highly lucrative ransomware attacks. Eurasian cyber criminals enjoy permissive operating environments in Russia and other former Soviet republics.* According to U.S. government reporting, TrickBot malware often enables initial access for Conti ransomware, which was used in nearly 450 global ransomware attacks in the first half of 2021\\. As of 2020, malicious cyber actors have purchased access to systems compromised by TrickBot malware on multiple occasions to conduct cybercrime operations.* In 2021, cyber criminals conducted mass phishing campaigns with Formbook, Agent Tesla, and Remcos malware that incorporated COVID\\-19 pandemic themes to steal personal data and credentials from businesses and individuals. In the criminal malware industry, including malware as a service (MaaS), developers create malware that malware distributors often broker to malware end\\-users.\\[ [2](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/documents/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_AAL_Malware_Trends_Paper_S508C.pdf)  ] Developers of these top 2021 malware strains continue to support, improve, and distribute their malware over several years. Malware developers benefit from lucrative cyber operations with low risk of negative consequences. Many malware developers often operate from locations with few legal prohibitions against malware development and deployment. Some developers even market their malware products as legitimate cyber security tools. For example, the developers of Remcos and Agent Tesla have marketed the software as legitimate tools for remote management and penetration testing. Malicious cyber actors can purchase Remcos and Agent Tesla online for low cost and have been observed using both tools for malicious purposes.#### **Top Malware**#### **Agent Tesla*** **Overview**  : Agent Tesla is capable of stealing data from mail clients, web browsers, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. This malware can also capture screenshots, videos, and Windows clipboard data. It can also lead to credentials and tokens being available on the Dark Web for use by criminal actors. Agent Tesla is available online for purchase under the guise of being a legitimate tool for managing your personal computer. Its developers continue to add new functionality, including obfuscation capabilities and targeting additional applications for credential stealing.\\[ [3](https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/threat-labs-knowledge-base/agenttesla)  ]\\[ [4](https://threatpost.com/agent-tesla-microsoft-asmi/163581/)  ]* **Active Since**  : 2014* **Malware Type**  : RAT* **Delivery Method:**  Often delivered as a malicious attachment in phishing emails.* **Resources:**  See the MITRE ATT\\&CK page on [Agent Tesla](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/software/S0331/)  .#### **AZORult*** **Overview:**  AZORult is used to steal information from compromised systems.

As its developers updated its capabilities, GootLoader has evolved from a loader downloading a malicious payload into a multi\\-payload malware platform. As a loader malware, GootLoader is usually the first stage of a system compromise. By leveraging search engine poisoning, GootLoader\u2019s developers may compromise or create websites that rank highly in search engine results, such as Google search results.\\[ [27](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/alerts-advisories/gootloader-malware-platform-uses-sophisticated-techniques-to-deliver-malware)  ]* **Active Since:**  At least 2020* **Malware Type:**  Loader* **Delivery Method:**  Malicious files available for download on compromised websites that rank high as search engine results.* **Resources:**  See [New Jersey\u2019s Cybersecurity \\& Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC) page on GootLooader](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/alerts-advisories/gootloader-malware-platform-uses-sophisticated-techniques-to-deliver-malware)  and [BlackBerry\u2019s Blog on GootLoader](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/07/gootloader-from-seo-poisoning-to-multi-stage-downloader)  .### Mitigations Below are the steps that CISA and ACSC recommend organizations take to improve their cybersecurity posture based on known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CISA and ACSC urge critical infrastructure organizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by (1\\) updating software, (2\\) enforcing MFA, (3\\) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, (4\\) making offline backups of your data, and (5\\) providing end\\-user awareness and training.* **Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT network assets**  . Prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  and critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial\\-of\\-service on internet\\-facing equipment.\t+ Consider using a centralized patch management system.\t+ Consider signing up for CISA\u2019s\t [cyber hygiene services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services) \t , including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA\u2019s vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.* **Enforce MFA**  to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have [strong](/tips/st04-002)  passwords. Do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access. Additionally, ACSC has issued guidance on [implementing multifactor authentication](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-multi-factor-authentication)  for hardening authentication systems.* **If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely**  . RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky services, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on\\-path attacker.\t+ Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.\t+ Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389\\).* **Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data**  . Backup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test backup procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable the spread of malware.\t+ Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a ransomware incident.\t+ Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data assets.* **Provide end\\-user awareness and training**  to help prevent successful targeted social engineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors for ransomware.\t+ Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods.\t+ Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they receive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident. As part of a longer\\-term effort, **implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and functionality**  . Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware and threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks. The ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions outside their control.### **RESOURCES*** For alerts on malicious and criminal cyber activity, see the [FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/)  webpage.* For more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware, refer to [StopRansomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/)  , a centralized, U.S. Government webpage providing ransomware resources and alerts.* The ACSC recommends organizations implement eight essential mitigation strategies from the ACSC\u2019s [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/essential-eight)  as a cybersecurity baseline. These strategies, known as the \u201cEssential Eight,\u201d make it much harder for adversaries to compromise systems.* Refer to the ACSC\u2019s practical guides on how to [protect yourself against ransomware attacks](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ransomware/protect-yourself-against-ransomware-attacks)  and [what to do if you are held at ransom](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ransomware/what-to-do)  at [cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ransomware/)  .### **DISCLAIMER** The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
