MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or are not yet, available.\n \n\n\n* Teamcenter Visualization V13\\.2:\n [Update to V13\\.2\\.0\\.12 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/) \n .\n* Teamcenter Visualization V13\\.3:\n [Update to V13\\.3\\.0\\.8 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/) \n .\n* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.0:\n [Update to V14\\.0\\.0\\.4 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/) \n .\n* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.1:\n [Update to V14\\.1\\.0\\.6 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/) \n .\n\n\n\n Siemens identified the following specific workaround and mitigation users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* Do not open untrusted CGM or RAS files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\n [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n , and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Please see\n [additional information on industrial security by Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact\n [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-700053 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-700053.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-700053.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
