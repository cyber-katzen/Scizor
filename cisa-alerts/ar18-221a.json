Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government. This malware variant has been identified as KEYMARBLE. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\nThis malware report contains analysis of one 32-bit Windows executable file, identified as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). This malware is capable of accessing device configuration data, downloading additional files, executing commands, modifying the registry, capturing screen shots, and exfiltrating data.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\nMAR-10135536-17.stix\n\nSubmitted Files (1)\ne23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09 (704d491c155aad996f16377a35732c...)\nIPs (3)\n100.43.153.60\n104.194.160.59\n212.143.21.43\n\nFindings\n\ne23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09\nTags\ntrojan\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\n704d491c155aad996f16377a35732cb4\n\n\nSize\n126976 bytes\n\n\nType\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nMD5\n704d491c155aad996f16377a35732cb4\n\n\nSHA1\nd1410d073a6df8979712dd1b6122983f66d5bef8\n\n\nSHA256\ne23900b00ffd67cd8dfa3283d9ced691566df6d63d1d46c95b22569b49011f09\n\n\nSHA512\n0092900bf4ca71c17a3caa225a4d7dcc60c7b58f7ffd173f46731db7f696e34b2e752aefaf9cedc27fe76fe317962a394f1be2e59bd0cffaabd9f88cc4daedcc\n\n\nssdeep\n3072:IDdXEYhXxS550wwiY0Pe6Q1vLo4lJnCtea:EXEEXxcQxZ\n\n\nEntropy\n6.264656\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nAhnlab\nTrojan/Win32.Agent\n\n\nAntiy\nTrojan/Win32.AGeneric\n\n\nAvira\nTR/Agent.rhagj\n\n\nBitDefender\nTrojan.GenericKD.4837544\n\n\nESET\na variant of Win32/NukeSped.H trojan\n\n\nEmsisoft\nTrojan.GenericKD.4837544 (B)\n\n\nIkarus\nTrojan.Agent\n\n\nK7\nTrojan ( 0050e4401 )\n\n\nMcAfee\nGenericRXBP-FF!704D491C155A\n\n\nNANOAV\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.eqcfki\n\n\nNetGate\nTrojan.Win32.Malware\n\n\nQuick Heal\nTrojan.IGENERIC\n\n\nSymantec\nProcess timed out\n\n\nTACHYON\nTrojan/W32.Agent.126976.CTO\n\n\nZillya!\nTrojan.NukeSped.Win32.5\n\n\n\nYara Rules\n\n\n\nhidden_cobra_consolidated.yara\nrule rsa_modulus { meta: Author=\"NCCIC trusted 3rd party\" Incident=\"10135536\" Date = \"2018/04/19\" category = \"hidden_cobra\" family = \"n/a\" description = \"n/a\" strings: $n = \"bc9b75a31177587245305cd418b8df78652d1c03e9da0cfc910d6d38ee4191d40\" condition: (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and any of them }\n\n\n\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nPE Metadata\n\n\n\nCompile Date\n2017-04-12 11:16:04-04:00\n\n\nImport Hash\nfc7dab4d20f23681313b91eba653aa21\n\n\n\nPE Sections\n\n\n\nMD5\nName\nRaw Size\nEntropy\n\n\n47f6fac41465e01dda5eac297ab250db\nheader\n4096\n0.627182\n\n\n30d34a8f4c29d7c2feb0f6e2b102b0a4\n.text\n94208\n6.633409\n\n\n77f4a11d375f0f35b64a0c43fab947b8\n.rdata\n8192\n5.054283\n\n\nd4364f6d2f55a37f0036e9e0dc2c6a2b\n.data\n20480\n4.416980\n\n\n\nPackers/Compilers/Cryptors\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ v6.0\n\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\ne23900b00f...\nConnected_To\n104.194.160.59\n\n\ne23900b00f...\nConnected_To\n212.143.21.43\n\n\ne23900b00f...\nConnected_To\n100.43.153.60\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis application is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable file, which functions as a RAT. When executed, it de-obfuscates its application programming interfaces (APIs) and using port 443, attempts to connect to the hard-coded IP addresses listed below. After connecting, the malware waits for further instructions.--Begin hard-coded IP addresses--100.43.153.60104.194.160.59212.143.21.43--End hard-coded IP addresses--Static analysis reveals that this RAT uses a customized XOR cryptographic algorithm displayed in Figure 1 to secure its data transfers and command-and-control (C2) sessions. It is designed to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions:--Begin functions--Download and upload filesExecute secondary payloadsExecute shell commandsTerminate running processesDelete filesSearch filesSet file attributesCreate registry entries for storing data:(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WABE\\DataPath)Collect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type)List running processes informationCapture screenshotsCollect and send information about the victim's system (operating system, CPU, MAC address, computer name, language settings, list of disk devices and their type, time elapsed since the system was started, and unique identifier of the victim's system)--End functions--\nScreenshots\n\n\nFigure 1 -

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate ACLs.\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in NIST's Special Publication 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops.\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nNCCICCustomerService@us-cert.gov (UNCLASS)\nus-cert@dhs.sgov.gov (SIPRNET)\nus-cert@dhs.ic.gov (JWICS)\n\nNCCIC continuously strives to improve its products and services. You can help by answering a very short series of questions about this product at the following URL: https://us-cert.gov/forms/feedback/\n\nDocument FAQ\n\nWhat is a MAR? A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is intended to provide organizations with more detailed malware analysis acquired via manual reverse engineering. To request additional analysis, please contact US-CERT and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\nCan I submit malware to NCCIC? Malware samples can be submitted via three methods:\n\nWeb: https://malware.us-cert.gov\nE-Mail: submit@malware.us-cert.gov\nFTP: ftp.malware.us-cert.gov (anonymous)\n\nNCCIC encourages you to report any suspicious activity, including cybersecurity incidents, possible malicious code, software vulnerabilities, and phishing-related scams.
