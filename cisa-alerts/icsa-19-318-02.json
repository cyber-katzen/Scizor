Siemens recommends users configure their environment according to the Siemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals to operate the devices in a protected environment.\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.\n\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT:\u00a0 http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories.\n\nFor more information on the vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-686531 at the following location:\u00a0 http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely; no known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
