[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryElcomplus SmartPTT SCADA Server=============================== Last Revised April 25, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-109\\-051\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Elcomplus* **Equipment:**  SmartPTT SCADA Server* **Vulnerabilities:**  Cross\\-site Scripting, Unauthorized Exposure to Sensitive Information, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Path Traversal, Cross\\-site Request Forgery2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized user to store dangerous data in a trusted database; potentially exposing sensitive information; allow malicious users to upload arbitrary files; provide attackers a way to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory; or result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following version of SmartPTT SCADA Server, an integrated voice and data dispatch software, is affected:* SmartPTT SCADA Server v1\\.4### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into critical parameters.[CVE\\-2021\\-43932](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43932)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE\\-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) An unauthenticated user can request various files from the server without any authentication or authorization.[CVE\\-2021\\-43938](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43938)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Elcomplus has released an update to fix these vulnerabilities and recommends users upgrade to [Version 2\\.3\\.4 or later](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ovX1IdMKtVDnrBcSbKkY40e57Ib2bIex)  . For more information, please contact [Elcomplus support](https://support.smartptt.com/hc/en-us)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
