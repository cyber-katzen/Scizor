EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Elcomplus\nEquipment: SmartPTT SCADA Server\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, Unauthorized Exposure to Sensitive Information, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Path Traversal, Cross-site Request Forgery\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized user to store dangerous data in a trusted database; potentially exposing sensitive information; allow malicious users to upload arbitrary files; provide attackers a way to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory; or result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of SmartPTT SCADA Server, an integrated voice and data dispatch software, is affected:\n\nSmartPTT SCADA Server v1.4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\nAn authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into critical parameters.\nCVE-2021-43932 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\nAn unauthenticated user can request various files from the server without any authentication or authorization.\nCVE-2021-43938 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\u00a0\nThe server has a feature that allows the upload of application updates; however, validation is not required, which enables malicious users to upload arbitrary files.\nCVE-2021-43934 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-35\nThe software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize dot slash sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\nCVE-2021-43930 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\nThe web application does not, or cannot, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\nCVE-2021-43937 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Russia\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nElcomplus has released an update to fix these vulnerabilities and recommends users upgrade to Version 2.3.4 or later.\nFor more information, please contact Elcomplus support.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
