A CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJim Reprogle reported this vulnerability to Johnson Controls.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users update the products to the latest versions:\n\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity Compressor control panels to firmware version 11.22 (Q5) or 12.22 (Q6).\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity AcuAir control panels to firmware version 11.12 (Q5) or 12.12 (Q6).\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity Condenser/Vessel control panels to firmware version 11.11 (Q5) or 12.11 (Q6).\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity Evaporator control panels to firmware version 11.11 (Q5) or 12.11 (Q6).\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity Engine Room control panels to firmware version 11.11 (Q5) or 12.11 (Q6).\nUpdate all Quantum HD Unity Interface control panels to firmware version 11.11 (Q5) or 12.11 (Q6).\n\nRefer to the\u00a0update procedure\u00a0for assistance in applying the mitigations provided by Johnson Controls.\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory\u00a0JCI-PSA-2023-09 v1.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
