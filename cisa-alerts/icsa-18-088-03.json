Enabling \u201cEncrypted Communication\u201d completely mitigates the vulnerability.* Apply cell protection concept.* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.* Apply Defense\\-in\\-Depth. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly recommends that users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/content/dam/webassetpool/mam/tag-siemens-com/smdb/digital-factory/industrial-security/online/documents/whitepapers/en/operational-guidelines-industrial-security-en.pdf)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
