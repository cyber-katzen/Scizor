Moxa has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Moxa VPort ActiveX SDK products (all versions prior to Version 2.8) are affected:\n\nMxNVR-MO4 Series,\nVPort 26A-1MP Series,\nVPort 351,\nVPort 354,\nVPort 36-1MP Series,\nVPort 364A Series,\nVPort 451,\nVPort 461,\nVPort 56-2MP Series,\nVPort P06-1MP-M12,\nVPort P06HC-1MP-M12 Series,\nVPort P16-1MP-M12 Series, and\nVPort P16-1MP-M12-IR Series.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code at the same privilege level at which VPort was running.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMoxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, and Brazil.\nThe affected products, Moxa VPort, is a family of camera, recorder, and encoders. ActiveX Control is an OCX component that uses Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) technology to enable software components to communicate. ActiveX is found in VB, VC, and C# developing environments, as well as plug-ins for web applications and automation tools (e.g., SCADA software). According to Moxa, VPort ActiveX SDK products are deployed across all 16 sectors. Moxa estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed April 07, 2015.\n\nA function in ActiveX has a Stack-Based Buffer Overflow vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow insertion of lines of assembly code such as a call to another tool.\nCVE-2015-0986NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0986, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. ZDI has assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed April 07, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to craft a working exploit for this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nMoxa has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability.\nhttp://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?d_id=2114\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nUse input validation prior to the execution of requests.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
