[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryTrihedral Engineering Limited VTScada Integer Overflow Vulnerability==================================================================== Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-343\\-02OVERVIEW-------- An anonymous researcher working with HP\u2019s Zero Day Initiative has identified an integer overflow vulnerability in Trihedral Engineering Ltd\u2019s VTScada application. Trihedral Engineering Limited\u00a0has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following VTS and VTScada versions are affected:* VTS Version 6\\.5 through 9\\.1\\.19* VTS Version 10 through 10\\.2\\.21* VTScada Version 11\\.0 through 11\\.1\\.07IMPACT------ An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause an integer overflow, resulting in an attempt to allocate an excessively large memory block. The failure of which would terminate the VTScada server. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Trihedral Engineering Ltd. is a Canada\\-based company that maintains offices in the United States and the United Kingdom. The affected products, VTScada (also known as VTS prior to 2013\\), are Windows\\-based SCADA systems with a web interface option. According to Trihedral Engineering Limited, VTScada is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Communications, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems, and other sectors. Trihedral Engineering Ltd. estimates that these products are used primarily in North America and Europe.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INTEGER OVERFLOWCWE\\-190: Integer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190\\.html, web site last accessed December 09, 2014\\. An attacker can cause VTScada to crash on an Internet server if a specifically crafted malformed network request is made to VTScada, even if that attacker does not have security credentials on the server. The malformed network request causes an integer overflow resulting in the attempted allocation of an excessively large buffer. The failure to allocate this buffer will terminate the VTScada server. The crash would not occur accidentally as a result of normal use. This vulnerability has existed in versions of VTScada and VTS since Version 6\\.5\\. CVE\\-2014\\-9192NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-9192, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed December 09, 2014\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- Trihedral Engineering Limited has created three updated versions of software. These software updates are available from Trihedral Engineering Ltd.\u2019s FTP site:<ftp://ftp.trihedral.com/VTS/> Version Information:* 11\\.1\\.09 \u2013 Latest build including newest features and fixes.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
