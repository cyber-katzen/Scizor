EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC and SIPLUS products\nVulnerabilities: Uncontrolled Recursion, Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized attacker with network access to the web server to perform a denial-of-service attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU 412-2 PN V7 (6ES7412-2EK07-0AB0): All versions\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU 414-3 PN/DP V7 (6ES7414-3EM07-0AB0): All versions\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU 414F-3 PN/DP V7 (6ES7414-3FM07-0AB0): All versions\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU 416-3 PN/DP V7 (6ES7416-3ES07-0AB0): All versions\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU 416F-3 PN/DP V7 (6ES7416-3FS07-0AB0): All versions\nSIMATIC\u00a0PC-Station Plus: All versions\nSINAMICS S120 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to SP3 HF15\nSIPLUS S7-400 CPU 414-3 PN/DP V7 (6AG1414-3EM07-7AB0): All versions\nSIPLUS S7-400 CPU 416-3 PN/DP V7 (6AG1416-3ES07-7AB0): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RECURSION CWE-674\nThe affected products do not handle HTTP(S) requests to the web server correctly. This could allow an attacker to exhaust system resources and create a denial-of-service condition for the device.\nCVE-2022-47374\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0BUFFER ACCESS WITH INCORRECT LENGTH VALUE CWE-805\nThe affected products do not handle long file names correctly. This could allow an attacker to create a buffer overflow and create a denial-of-service condition for the device.\nCVE-2022-47375\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating the following products to the latest version where available:\n\nSINAMICS S120 (incl. SIPLUS variants): Update to\u00a0V5.2 SP3 HF15 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nDisable the web server of the affected system\nRestrict access to webserver for trusted users only\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-892915 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
