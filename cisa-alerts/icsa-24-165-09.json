EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SICAM AK3, SICAM BC and SICAM TM\nVulnerability: Improper Null Termination\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\n\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or create a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSiemens CPCX26 Central Processing/Communication: Versions prior to V06.02\nSiemens ETA4 Ethernet Interface IEC60870-5-104: Versions prior to V10.46\nSiemens ETA5 Ethernet Int. 1x100TX IEC61850 Ed.2: Versions prior to V03.27\nSiemens PCCX26 Ax 1703 PE, Contr, Communication Element: Versions prior to V06.05\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER NULL TERMINATION CWE-170\nThe affected device firmwares contain an improper null termination vulnerability while parsing a specific HTTP header. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process or lead to denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2024-31484 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-31484. A base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing and Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nCPCX26 Central Processing/Communication: Update to V06.02 or later version.\n\nThe firmware CPCX26 V06.2 is present within \"SICAM RTUs AK3 Package\" V06.02\n\n\nPCCX26 Ax 1703 PE, Contr, Communication Element: Update to V06.05 or later version\n\nThe firmware PCCX26 V06.05 is present within \"SICAM RTUs AK3 Package\" V06.02\n\n\nETA4 Ethernet Interface IEC60870-5-104: Update to V10.46 or later version\n\nThe firmware ETA4 V10.46 is present within \"SICAM RTUs AK3 Package\" V06.02\n\n\nETA5 Ethernet Int. 1x100TX IEC61850 Ed.2: Update to V03.27 or later version\n\nThe firmware ETA5 V03.27 is present within \"SICAM RTUs AK3 Package\" V06.02\n\n\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-620338 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJune 13, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
