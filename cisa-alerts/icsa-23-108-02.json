MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric became aware of a public PoC detailing an exploit for prior versions of the APC Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software, and strongly recommends all users take the defensive actions listed in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n The affected software is being discontinued with the discontinuation of the Easy UPS Online SNMP Cards (APV9601, APVS9601\\) managed by this software. Fixed versions notwithstanding, Schneider Electric recommends users to migrate to the PowerChute series of software, including PowerChute Serial Shutdown and PowerChute Network Shutdown. For more information, please see the following sites:\n \n\n\n* [PowerChute Serial Shutdown](https://www.apc.com/pcss)\n* [PowerChute Network Shutdown](https://www.apc.com/pcns)\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric recommends users update their affected devices to the following versions or later:\n \n\n\n* APC Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software:\n [Version 2\\.6\\-GA](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_enDocType=Software+-+Release&p_Doc_Ref=APC_install_APC_UPS_windows) \n or later\n* Schneider Electric Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software:\n [Version 2\\.6\\-GS](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_enDocType=Software+-+Release&p_Doc_Ref=Install_Schneider_UPS_windows) \n or later\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric recommends that users use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems and impact evaluate these patches in a test, development, or offline infrastructure environment. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the use of backups.\n \n\n\n\n Users can contact\n [Schneider Electric's Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp) \n for additional assistance.\n \n\n\n\n Schneider Electric strongly recommends users follow cybersecurity industry best practices, including:\n \n\n\n* Locating control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from the business network.\n* Installing physical controls to help prevent unauthorized users from accessing industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n* Placing all controllers in locked cabinets, and do not leave them in the \"Program\" mode.\n* Only connecting programming software to the network intended for that device.\n* Scanning all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network before use in the terminals or nodes connected to these networks.\n* Properly sanitizing mobile devices that have connected to another network before connecting to the intended network.\n* Minimizing network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the internet.\n* Using secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), when remote access is required.\n* For more information, refer to the\n [Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/) \n document.\n\n\n\n For more information, see\n [Schneider Electric security notification SEVD\\-2023\\-101\\-04](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2023-101-04&p_enDocType=Security+and+Safety+Notice&p_File_Name=SEVD-2023-101-04.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n \n\n\n5\\.
