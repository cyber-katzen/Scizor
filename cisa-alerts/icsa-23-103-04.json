For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.3\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0TIA Portal\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Improper Input Validation\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nTIA Portal V15: All versions\u00a0\nTIA Portal V16: All versions\u00a0\nTIA Portal V17: All versions\u00a0\nTIA Portal V18: All versions prior to v18 Update 1\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\u00a0\nAffected products contain a path traversal vulnerability that could allow the creation or overwriting of arbitrary files in the engineering system. If the user is tricked into opening a malicious PC system configuration file, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-26293\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an update for TIA Portal V18 and recommends updating to the latest version. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet, available:\u00a0\n\nTIA Portal V18: Update to\u00a0V18 Update 1 or later version.\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nAvoid opening untrusted project files or PC system configuration files.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019\u00a0operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security web page.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens\u2019 products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-116924 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF. \u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
