For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely / low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Mendix SAML Module\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to the application.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nMendix SAML (Mendix 7 compatible): Versions 1.16.4 to 1.17.2\u00a0\nMendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible): Versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.3\u00a0\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, New Track): Versions 3.1.9 to 3.2.5\u00a0\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, Upgrade Track): Version 3.1.9 to 3.2.5\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHM CWE-303\u00a0\nThe affected versions of the module insufficiently verify the SAML assertions. This could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-25957\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Infrastructure\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible): Update to\u00a0V3.3.0 or later version\u00a0\nMendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible): Update to\u00a0V2.3.0 or later version\u00a0\nMendix SAML (Mendix 7 compatible): Update to\u00a0V1.17.3 or later version\u00a0\n\"Use Encryption\" setting should be set to \"On\" in the SAML module setting.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens website.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-851884 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
