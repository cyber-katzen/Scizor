EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 2.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Digi\u00a0International\nEquipment: ConnectPort LTS 32 MEI\nVulnerabilities: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could limit system availability.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ConnectPort LTS 32 MEI, which provides serial over Ethernet connectivity, are affected:\n\nConnectPort LTS 32 MEI: firmware Version 1.4.3 (82002228_K 08/09/2018), bios Version 1.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to upload a malicious file to the application.\nCVE-2020-6975 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n\u00a03.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nMultiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities exist that could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-6973 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMurat Aydemir, Critical Infrastructure Penetration Test Specialist at Biznet Bilisim A.S., and Fatih Kayran, Penetration Test Specialist at Biznet Bilisim A.S., reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDigi\u00a0recommends users upgrade to the mandatory release of ConnectPort LTS Version 1.4.5, released on November 8, 2019.\nDigi\u00a0International recommends the following best practices:\n\nTest the new release in a controlled environment with your application before you update production devices.\nUnless otherwise noted, apply updates in the following order:\n\n\nDevice firmware\nModem firmware\nConfiguration\nApplication\n\nIf you prefer manually updating one device at a time, follow these steps from the manual: Firmware update process\nContact the Digi\u00a0Technical Support team at https://www.digi.com/support to find out more on this release.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n\u00a0\n",
