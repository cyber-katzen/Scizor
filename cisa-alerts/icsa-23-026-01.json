EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Delta Electronics\u00a0\nEquipment: CNCSoft \u00a0\nVulnerability: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a buffer overflow condition, which could allow remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CNCSoft, a software management platform, are affected:\u00a0\n\nCNCSoft: All versions prior to v1.01.34\u00a0\nRunning ScreenEditor: All versions 1.01.5 and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\u00a0\nAll versions prior to Delta Electronic\u2019s CNCSoft version 1.01.34 (running ScreenEditor versions 1.01.5 and prior) are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-4634 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSimon Humbert, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics released an updated version of CNCSoft and recommends users update to v1.01.34 or later.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
