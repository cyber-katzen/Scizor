EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 9\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit/exploitable from within the same local subnet\n* **Vendor:** \n Philips\n* **Equipment:** \n Philips e\\-Alert Unit (non\\-medical device)\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Improper Input Validation, Cross\\-site Scripting, Information Exposure, Incorrect Default Permissions, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Cross\\-site Request Forgery, Session Fixation, Resource Exhaustion, Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials.\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation from an attacker within the same subnet may impact or compromise user contact details, unit integrity, and/or unit availability. The vulnerabilities may allow attackers to provide unexpected input into the application, execute arbitrary code, display unit information, or potentially cause e\\-Alert to crash.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following Philips e\\-Alert versions are affected:\n \n\n\n* Version R2\\.1 and prior.\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The software does not validate input properly, allowing an attacker to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This would lead to parts of the unit receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2018\\-8850](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8850) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user\\-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is then served to other users.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2018\\-8846](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8846) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n In June of 2018, Philips released Version R2\\.1 to remediate CWE\\-319, CWE\\-20, CWE\\-798, and CWE\\-384\\. \u00a0Philips has another product software update planned for the end of 2018 that addresses CWE\\-400, CWE\\-79, CWE\\-276, CWE\\-200, and CWE\\-352\\.\n \n\n\n\n Philips will communicate service options to all affected install\\-base users.\n \n\n\n\n Please see the Philips product security website for the latest public security information on this matter and for other Philips products:\n \n\n\n\n<https://www.philips.com/productsecurity>\n\n\n\n\n As an immediate mitigation to the vulnerabilities on the LAN until the update can be applied, Philips recommends that users:\n \n\n\n* Ensure that network security best practices are implemented, and\n* Limit network access to e\\-Alert in accordance with product documentation.\n\n\n\n Users with questions regarding their specific e\\-Alert installations should contact their local Philips service support team or their regional e\\-Alert service support. Contact information is available at the following location:\n \n\n\n\n[https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer\\-service\\-solutions](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions) \n\n\n\n\n NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n NCCIC also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Philips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-18-242-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
