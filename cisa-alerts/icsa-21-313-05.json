EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  OSIsoft* **Equipment:**  PI Vision* **Vulnerabilities:**  Cross\\-site Scripting, Incorrect Authorization2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure, modification, or deletion.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of PI Vision, a data management platform, are affected:* PI:Vision: All versions prior to 2021### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) A remote attacker with write access to PI Vision could inject code into a display. Unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or deletion is possible if a victim views or interacts with the infected display using Microsoft Internet Explorer. The impact affects PI System data and other data accessible with victim\u2019s user permissions.[CVE\\-2021\\-43551](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43551)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html) PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.[CVE\\-2021\\-43553](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43553)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER OSIsoft reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- OSIsoft recommends upgrading to PI vision 2021\\. Information can be found in the [OSIsoft PI Vision security bulletin](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=000037521)  (registration required). OSIsoft recommends users apply the following workarounds for PI Vision to help reduce risk:* Configure Publisher and Explorer roles in PI Vision User Access Levels to restrict which users can create or modify displays.* Remove any Limits properties from AF child attributes using PI System Explorer or a bulk editing tool. OSIsoft recommends the following defense measures to lower the impact of exploitation for PI Vision:* Use a modern web browser such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla FireFox. Do not use Microsoft Internet Explorer.* If upgrade is not an option, administrators should regularly audit the AF hierarchy to ensure there are no unexpected or unknown elements, attributes, or attribute properties. It is recommended security on elements in AF be configured and enforced in addition to configuring PI point security.* Potential unauthorized viewing of PI System data due to this issue is limited to permissions granted to the PI Vision Application Pool Identity.\u202f\u00a0Configure a dedicated identity mapping for PI Vision servers and manage permissions in accordance with a data classification policy. See [OSIsoft customer portal knowledge article](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=Security-Alerts)  for additional details and associated security updates (registration required). CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
