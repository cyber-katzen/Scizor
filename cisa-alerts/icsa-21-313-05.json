EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: OSIsoft\nEquipment: PI Vision\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, Incorrect Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure, modification, or deletion.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PI Vision, a data management platform, are affected:\n\nPI:Vision: All versions prior to 2021\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA remote attacker with write access to PI Vision could inject code into a display. Unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or deletion is possible if a victim views or interacts with the infected display using Microsoft Internet Explorer. The impact affects PI System data and other data accessible with victim\u2019s user permissions.\nCVE-2021-43551\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\nPI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\nCVE-2021-43553\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nOSIsoft reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOSIsoft recommends upgrading to PI vision 2021. Information can be found in the OSIsoft PI Vision security bulletin\u00a0(registration required).\nOSIsoft recommends users apply the following workarounds for PI Vision to help reduce risk:\n\nConfigure Publisher and Explorer roles in PI Vision User Access Levels to restrict which users can create or modify displays.\nRemove any Limits properties from AF child attributes using PI System Explorer or a bulk editing tool.\n\nOSIsoft recommends the following defense measures to lower the impact of exploitation for PI Vision:\n\nUse a modern web browser such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla FireFox. Do not use Microsoft Internet Explorer.\nIf upgrade is not an option, administrators should regularly audit the AF hierarchy to ensure there are no unexpected or unknown elements, attributes, or attribute properties. It is recommended security on elements in AF be configured and enforced in addition to configuring PI point security.\nPotential unauthorized viewing of PI System data due to this issue is limited to permissions granted to the PI Vision Application Pool Identity.\u202f\u00a0Configure a dedicated identity mapping for PI Vision servers and manage permissions in accordance with a data classification policy.\n\nSee OSIsoft customer portal knowledge article for additional details and associated security updates (registration required).\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
