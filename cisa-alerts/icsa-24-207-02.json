EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Positron S.R.L\nEquipment: Broadcast Signal Processor TRA7005\nVulnerability: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and access unauthorized protected areas of the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Positron Broadcast Signal Processor are affected:\n\nBroadcast Signal Processor TRA7005: v1.20\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\nPositron Broadcast Signal Processor TRA7005 v1.20 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass exploit that could allow an attacker to have unauthorized access to protected areas of the application.\nCVE-2024-7007 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-7007. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Italy\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Italy\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof of concept (PoC) as authored by Gjoko Krstic and reported it to Positron.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPositron has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate this vulnerability. Users of affected versions of TRA7005 are invited to contact Positron customer support for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
