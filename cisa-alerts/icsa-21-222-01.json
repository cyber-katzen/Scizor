EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  JT2Go \\& Teamcenter Visualization* **Vulnerabilities:**  Use After Free, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, NULL Pointer Dereference2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash an application or execute arbitrary code.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products are affected:* JT2Go: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.1* Teamcenter Visualization: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.1### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) A use\\-after\\-free issue exists in the DGN file\\-reading procedure in the Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK, all versions prior to 2022\\.4, resulting from the lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data. This can result in a memory corruption or arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32944](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32944)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) An out\\-of\\-bounds write issue exists in the DXF file\\-recovering procedure in the Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK, all versions prior to 2022\\.4, resulting from the lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32936](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32936)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
