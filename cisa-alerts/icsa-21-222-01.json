TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following Siemens products are affected:\n \n\n\n* JT2Go: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.1\n* Teamcenter Visualization: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.1\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.1\n [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)\n\n\n\n A use\\-after\\-free issue exists in the DGN file\\-reading procedure in the Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK, all versions prior to 2022\\.4, resulting from the lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data. This can result in a memory corruption or arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-32944](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32944) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
