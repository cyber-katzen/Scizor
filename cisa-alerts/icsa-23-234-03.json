[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRockwell Automation ThinManager ThinServer========================================== Release Date August 22, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-234\\-031\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Rockwell Automation* **Equipment:**  ThinManager ThinServer* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to remotely delete arbitrary files with system privileges.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Rockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following versions of ThinManager ThinServer, a thin client and remote desktop protocol (RDP) server management software:* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 11\\.0\\.0\\-11\\.0\\.6* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 11\\.1\\.0\\-11\\.1\\.6* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 11\\.2\\.0\\-11\\.2\\.6* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 12\\.1\\.0\\-12\\.1\\.6* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 12\\.0\\.0\\-12\\.0\\.5* ThinManager ThinServer: Versions 13\\.0\\.0\\-13\\.0\\.2* ThinManager ThinServer: Version 13\\.1\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** Due to improper input validation, an integer overflow condition exists in the affected products. When the ThinManager processes incoming messages, a read access violation occurs and terminates the process. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted synchronization protocol message.[CVE\\-2023\\-2914](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2914)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** Due to improper input validation, a path traversal vulnerability exists when the ThinManager processes a certain function. If exploited, an unauthenticated remote threat actor can delete arbitrary files with system privileges. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted synchronization protocol message.[CVE\\-2023\\-2915](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2915)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** Due to improper input validation, a path traversal vulnerability exists, via the file name field, when the ThinManager processes a certain function. If exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to any directory on the disk drive where ThinServer.exe is installed. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted synchronization protocol message.[CVE\\-2023\\-2917](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2917)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\.
