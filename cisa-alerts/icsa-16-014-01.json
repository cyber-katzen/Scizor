Many of these vulnerabilities were reported through the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and iDefense. Advantech has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Ivan Sanchez has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities which he reported.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAdvantech reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of WebAccess:\n\nWebAccess Version 8.0 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities may be able to upload, create, or delete arbitrary files on the target system, deny access to valid users, or remotely execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdvantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface (HMI) product. According to Advantech, WebAccess is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Government Facilities. Advantech estimates that these products are used globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nACCESS OF MEMORY LOCATION AFTER END OF BUFFERCWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/788.html, web site last accessed January 14, 2016.\nThe software reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\nCVE-2016-0851NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0851, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This new version is available on the Advantech website at the following location:\nhttp://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page athttp://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
