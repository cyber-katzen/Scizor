EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: Allen-Bradley Stratix 5950\nVulnerabilities: Improper Input Validation, Improper Certificate Validation, Resource Management Errors\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass client certification to create connections to the affected device or cause the device to crash.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe Allen-Bradley Stratix 5950 uses the Cisco Systems, Inc., Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) as its central operating system. Cisco has released advisories disclosing multiple vulnerabilities in the ASA software.The following Allen-Bradley Stratix 5950 Security Appliances, running the Cisco ASA v9.6.2 and earlier, are affected:\n\n1783-SAD4T0SBK9,\n1783-SAD4T0SPK9,\n1783-SAD2T2SBK9, and\n1783-SAD2T2SPK9\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA vulnerability in the ingress flow creation functionality of the Cisco ASA could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to cause the CPU to increase upwards of 100 percent utilization, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on an affected system.\nCVE-2018-0228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nA vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Client Certificate Authentication feature for the Cisco ASA could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to establish an SSL VPN connection and bypass certain SSL certificate verification steps.\nCVE-2018-0227 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security library of the Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to trigger a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-0231 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ERRORS CWE-399\nMultiple vulnerabilities in the Application Layer Protocol Inspection feature of the Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-0240 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco ASA could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. It is also possible on certain software releases that the ASA will not reload, but a threat actor could view sensitive system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques.\nCVE-2018-0296 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Wisconsin, USA\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation will inform users of updated firmware as soon as it is available. Rockwell Automation recommends that users using affected devices apply the following risk mitigation strategies:\n\nCVE-2018-0228 \u2014 The ASA and FTD configuration commands\u2014set connection per-client-embryonic-max (TCP) and set connection per-client-max (TCP, UDP, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol [SCTP])\u2014can be configured to limit the number of connection requests allowed. Using these configuration parameters can reduce the number of connections and greatly reduce the impact of the DoS attack.\nCVE-2018-0227 \u2014 No workarounds available\nCVE-2018-0231 \u2014 No workarounds available\nCVE-2018-0240 \u2014 No workarounds available\nCVE-2018-0296 \u2014 Cisco has released Snort Rule 46897\n\nFor additional information please see the Rockwell Automation security notification at (login required): https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073860\nAdditionally the Cisco advisories can be found at the following links:\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa2\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa3\u00a0\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa_inspect\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
