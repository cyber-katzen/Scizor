A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE\\-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Client Certificate Authentication feature for the Cisco ASA could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to establish an SSL VPN connection and bypass certain SSL certificate verification steps.[CVE\\-2018\\-0227](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0227)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security library of the Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to trigger a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0231](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0231)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.4 [RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ERRORS CWE\\-399](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399.html) Multiple vulnerabilities in the Application Layer Protocol Inspection feature of the Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0240](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0240)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.5 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco ASA could allow an unauthenticated, remote threat actor to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. It is also possible on certain software releases that the ASA will not reload, but a threat actor could view sensitive system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques.[CVE\\-2018\\-0296](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0296)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation will inform users of updated firmware as soon as it is available. Rockwell Automation recommends that users using affected devices apply the following risk mitigation strategies:* CVE\\-2018\\-0228 \u2014 The ASA and FTD configuration commands\u2014set connection per\\-client\\-embryonic\\-max (TCP) and set connection per\\-client\\-max (TCP, UDP, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol \\[SCTP])\u2014can be configured to limit the number of connection requests allowed. Using these configuration parameters can reduce the number of connections and greatly reduce the impact of the DoS attack.* CVE\\-2018\\-0227 \u2014 No workarounds available* CVE\\-2018\\-0231 \u2014 No workarounds available* CVE\\-2018\\-0240 \u2014 No workarounds available* CVE\\-2018\\-0296 \u2014 Cisco has released [Snort Rule 46897](https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-06-07-new.html) For additional information please see the Rockwell Automation security notification at (login required): [https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\\_id/1073860](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__rockwellautomation.custhelp.com_app_answers_detail_a-5Fid_1073860&d=DwMGaQ&c=54IZrppPQZKX9mLzcGdPfFD1hxrcB__aEkJFOKJFd00&r=zE5lG3CZZIbdBvT6slVAzQ&m=d7_uax5LG0vjWoCGwelqASZRyzRGG85aflD3xxdn7I4&s=QsGtt5inxh43clly39aymIsyKWnoKwawSFbQUhiVVhA&e=)  Additionally the Cisco advisories can be found at the following links:[https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180418\\-asa2](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa2) [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180418\\-asa1](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1) [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180418\\-asa3](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa3) [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180418\\-asa\\_inspect](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa_inspect) [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180606\\-asaftd](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.
