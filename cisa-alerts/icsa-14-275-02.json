The AXM-NET Ethernet module is an accessory for the Acuvim II. Accuenergy has produced a firmware upgrade that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The researcher has tested the firmware to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Accuenergy Acuvim II accessory is affected:\n\nAXN-NET Ethernet module v.3.04\u00a0\n\nIMPACT\nThe authentication bypass vulnerability allows access to the settings on the Ethernet module web server interface without authenticating. The password bypass vulnerability allows an attacker to display passwords using JavaScript. A malicious user could create a denial of service for the web server by changing the network settings.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAccuenergy is a Canada-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and China.\nThe affected product, Acuvim II, is a multifunction power metering device. The AXM-NET Ethernet module creates a web page to display data produced by the Acuvim II. According to Accuenergy, Acuvim II is deployed in the Energy sector. Accuenergy estimates that this product is used primarily in North America and China.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASSCWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html, web site last accessed October 30, 2014.\n\nBy accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL) on the web server, a malicious user is able to access settings without authenticating. Accessible settings are limited, and include the network settings for the AXM-NET module web server, but not the Acuvim II device.\nCVE-2014-2373NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2373, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. \u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed October 30, 2014.\n\nPASSWORD DISCLOSURECWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html, web site last accessed October 30, 2014.\n\nThe Acuvim II uses JavaScript to validate passwords leaving it vulnerable to a JavaScript attack that displays passwords. Authenticated users could change the network settings of the AXM-NET module web server, but do not have access to the Acuvim II device.\nCVE-2014-2374NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2374, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).\u00a0CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed October 30, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n\nDIFFICULTY\n\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nAccuenergy has produced a patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The patch can be downloaded at the following location:\nhttp://www.accuenergy.com/firmware-update-axm-net\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (www.ics-cert.org).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n2.
