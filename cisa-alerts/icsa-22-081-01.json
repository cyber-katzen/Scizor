MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Delta Electronics has fixed the reported vulnerabilities and recommends users [upgrade to version 1\\.9](https://downloadcenter.deltaww.com/en-US/DownloadCenter?v=1&q=DIAEnergie%20V1.9&sort_expr=cdate&sort_dir=DESC)  or later**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update C Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Delta also suggests users:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against \u201cPath Traversal\u201d and \u201cSQL Injection\u201d weakness.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
