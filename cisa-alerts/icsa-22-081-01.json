MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\nDelta Electronics has fixed the reported vulnerabilities and recommends users upgrade to version 1.9 or later\n--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\nDelta also suggests users:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nUse an application firewall that can detect attacks against \u201cPath Traversal\u201d and \u201cSQL Injection\u201d weakness.\nNever connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
