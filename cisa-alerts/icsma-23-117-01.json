EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Illumina\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Universal Copy Service (UCS)\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address, Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take any action at the operating system level. A threat actor could impact settings, configurations, software, or data on the affected product; a threat actor could interact through the affected product via a connected network.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products using Illumina Universal Copy Service are affected:\u00a0\n\niScan Control Software: v4.0.0\u00a0\niScan Control Software: v4.0.5\u00a0\niSeq 100: All versions\u00a0\nMiniSeq Control Software: v2.0 and newer\u00a0\nMiSeq Control Software: v4.0 (RUO Mode)\u00a0\nMiSeqDx Operating Software: v4.0.1 and newer\u00a0\nNextSeq 500/550 Control Software: v4.0\u00a0\nNextSeq 550Dx Control Software: \u00a0v4.0 (RUO Mode)\u00a0\nNextSeq 550Dx Operating Software: \u00a0v1.0.0 to 1.3.1\u00a0\nNextSeq 550Dx Operating Software: v1.3.3 and newer\u00a0\nNextSeq 1000/2000 Control Software: v1.4.1 and prior\u00a0\nNovaSeq 6000 Control Software: v1.7 and prior\u00a0\nNovaSeq Control Software: v1.8\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0BINDING TO AN UNRESTRICTED IP ADDRESS CWE-1327\u00a0\nInstruments with Illumina Universal Copy Service v2.x are vulnerable due to binding to an unrestricted IP address. An unauthenticated malicious actor could use UCS to listen on all IP addresses, including those capable of accepting remote communications.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-1968\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0EXECUTION WITH UNNECESSARY PRIVILEGES CWE-250\u00a0\nInstruments with Illumina Universal Copy Service v1.x and v2.x contain an unnecessary privileges vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor could upload and execute code remotely at the operating system level, which could allow an attacker to change settings, configurations, software, or access sensitive data on the affected product.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-1966\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Healthcare and Public Health\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIllumina reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nIllumina recommends using the\u00a0UCS Vulnerability Instructions Guide\u00a0based on the user\u2019s specific system configuration to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Illumina recommends users read the instructions before downloading any software.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
