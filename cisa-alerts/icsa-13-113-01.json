[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryWonderware Information Server Vulnerabilities============================================= Last Revised August 01, 2013 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-113\\-01 Overview This advisory was originally posted to the US\\-CERT secure Portal library on April 23, 2013, and is now being released to the ICS\\-CERT Web page. This advisory provides mitigation details for multiple vulnerabilities that impact the Invensys Wonderware Information Server (WIS) software. Researchers Gleb Gritsai, Nikita Mikhalevsky, Timur Yunusov, Denis Baranov, Alexey Osipov, Vyacheslav Egoshin, Dmitry Serebryannikov, Ivan Poliyanchuk, Evgeny Ermakov, and Ilya Karpov of the Positive Technologies Research Team have identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Invensys WIS software. Invensys has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The Positive Technologies Research Team has tested the update and validated that it fixes the vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could impact systems deployed in the critical manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemical, and water and wastewater sectors. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.Affected Products----------------- The following Invensys WIS versions are affected:* WIS 4\\.0 SP1SP1 and 4\\.5\u2013 Portal, and* WIS 5\\.0\u2013 Portal.Impact------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute remote code, disclose information, or perform session credential high jacking of the Invensys WIS. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- Invensys is a global technology company that works with industrial, commercial, rail operators, and appliance operators in over 180 countries. Invensys develops software, systems, and equipment that enable users to monitor, automate, and control their processes. The Invensyshttp://www.invensys.com/, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013\\. WIS software is used in many industries worldwide, including critical manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemical, and water and wastewater. WIS provides industrial information content including process graphics, trends, and reports on a single Web page. WIS Web clients allow access to real\\-time dashboards, predesigned reports of industrial activities, and provide analysis or write back capabilities to the process. Vulnerability CharacterizationVulnerability overview----------------------### Cross\\-site ScriptingCWE\\-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross\\-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79\\.html, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013\\. This vulnerability enables an attacker to inject client\\-side script into Web pages viewed by other users or bypass client\\-side security mechanisms imposed by modern Web browsers. This vulnerability, if exploited, could allow arbitrary code execution and may require social engineering to exploit.

Mitigation Invensys has developed an update to the WIS software that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The Positive Technologies Research Team has tested the update and validated that it fixes the vulnerabilities. Instructions to download and install the update are found on the Invensys download page at the following link:<https://wdn.wonderware.com/sites/WDN/Pages/Downloads/Software.aspx> According to Invensys, any machine running one or more of the products listed above is affected and should be patched. No other components of the WIS installed products are affected. Users should install the update using instructions provided in the ReadMe file for the product and component being installed. Invensys recommends that users should set the Security level settings in the Internet browser to \u201cMedium \u2013 High\u201d to minimize the risks presented by these vulnerabilities. ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies *.*  CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013\\. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, [Target Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/tips/ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B, Web site last accessed May 07, 2013\\.](#_ftn15)  that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT Web page ( [www.ics\\-cert.org](http://www.ics-cert.org/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

DOCUMENT FAQ**What is an ICS\\-CERT Advisory?**  An ICS\\-CERT Advisory is intended to provide awareness or solicit feedback from critical infrastructure owners and operators concerning ongoing cyber events or activity with the potential to impact critical infrastructure computing networks.**When is vulnerability attribution provided to researchers?**  Attribution for vulnerability discovery is always provided to the vulnerability reporter unless the reporter notifies ICS\\-CERT that they wish to remain anonymous. ICS\\-CERT encourages researchers to coordinate vulnerability details before public release. The public release of vulnerability details prior to the development of proper mitigations may put industrial control systems and the public at avoidable risk.**I see that this document is labeled as TLP \\= WHITE.
