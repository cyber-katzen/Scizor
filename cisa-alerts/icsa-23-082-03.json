RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized execution of actions, a denial-of-service condition, or retrieval of sensitive information.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSAUTER reports these vulnerabilities affect the following EY-modulo 5 Building Automation Stations: \u00a0\n\nEY-AS525F001 with moduWeb\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\u00a0\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker could provide a malicious link and trick an unsuspecting user into clicking on it. If clicked, the attacker could execute the malicious JavaScript (JS) payload in the target\u2019s security context.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-28650\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\u00a0\nA malicious user could leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions in the context of the targeted privileged users.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-28655\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\u00a0\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker could force all authenticated users, such as administrative users, to perform unauthorized actions by viewing the logs. This action would also grant the attacker privilege escalation.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22300\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\u00a0\nAn authenticated malicious user could acquire the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) Password in cleartext format, despite it being protected and hidden behind asterisks. The attacker could then perform further attacks using the SMTP credentials.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-27927\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\u00a0\nAn authenticated malicious user could successfully upload a malicious image could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-28652\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing, Energy\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIthaca Labs of Odyssey Cyber Security reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAccording to SAUTER, the EY-modulo 5 Building Automation Stations product line does not support encryption on its communication protocols. As such, it is not appropriate for open networks. \u00a0\nSAUTER recommends deactivating moduWeb when not in use as doing so closes the vulnerabilities related to the web server and the mail client service; users can upgrade to the latest generation modulo 6 with moduWeb Unity as the web server, which supports encrypted communication with TLS.\u00a0\nSAUTER recommends users take all necessary measures to protect the integrity of building automation networks, restrict access to the devices, and leverage all appropriate means and policies to minimize risks. Users should evaluate and upgrade legacy systems to current solutions where necessary.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
