EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v4 6\\.1**\n* **ATTENTION** \n : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor** \n : Siemens\n* **Equipment** \n : RUGGEDCOM APE1808\n* **Vulnerabilities** \n : Network Amplification, Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, External Control of File Name or Path, Cross\\-site Scripting, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a network\\-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial\\-of\\-service (RDoS) attacks.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following versions of Siemens RUGGEDCOM APE1808, an application hosting platform, are affected:\n \n\n\n* Siemens RUGGEDCOM APE1808: All versions with Palo Alto Networks Virtual NGFW before V11\\.0\\.1\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**INSUFFICIENT CONTROL OF NETWORK MESSAGE VOLUME (NETWORK AMPLIFICATION) CWE\\-406**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/406.html)\n\n\n\n A PAN\\-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network\\-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA\\-Series (hardware), VM\\-Series (virtual) and CN\\-Series (container) firewall against an attacker\\-specified target. To be misused by an external attacker, the firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a source zone that has an external facing interface. This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and, if set, is likely unintended by the administrator. If exploited, this issue would not impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our products. However, the resulting denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) attack may help obfuscate the identity of the attacker and implicate the firewall as the source of the attack. We have taken prompt action to address this issue in our PAN\\-OS software. All software updates for this issue are expected to be released no later than the week of August 15, 2022\\. This issue does not impact Panorama M\\-Series or Panorama virtual appliances. This issue has been resolved for all Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access customers and no additional action is required from them.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-0028](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-0028) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* RUGGEDCOM APE1808: Upgrade Palo Alto Networks Virtual NGFW V11\\.0\\.1\\. Contact Siemens customer support to receive patch and update information.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-822518 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-822518.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-822518.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this (these) vulnerability(ies), such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.
