This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to brute force session IDs and hijack existing sessions.\nCVE-2022-26647 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nAffected devices do not properly validate the GET parameter XNo of incoming HTTP requests. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash affected devices.\nCVE-2022-26648 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H)\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nAffected devices do not properly validate the URI of incoming HTTP GET requests. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash affected devices.\nCVE-2022-26649 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software if available:\n\nThe products listed are only affected up to v5.2.6. Update to v5.2.6 or later\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can implement to reduce exploitation risk:\n\nRestrict access to the affected systems, especially on port 80/TCP and port 443/TCP, to trusted IP addresses\nDeactivate the webserver if not required and if deactivation is supported by the product\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-310038.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
