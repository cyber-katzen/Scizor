MITIGATIONS\nYokogawa recommends users of affected devices and versions update to the latest available release. Details about the products, affected revisions, and suggested mitigations are available in the Yokogawa Security Advisory Report \u201cYSAR-198-0001: Vulnerability of access control in License Manager Service of Yokogawa products.\u201d\u00a0 This advisory can be found at the following location:https://web-material3.yokogawa.com/1/20653/files/YSAR-19-0001-E.pdfFor questions related to this report and details regarding how to update to the newest revision, please visit the Yokogawa security website (registration required):\u00a0 https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c-id=000498\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
