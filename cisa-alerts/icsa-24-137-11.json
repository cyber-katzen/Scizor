EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: RUGGEDCOM APE1808\nVulnerabilities: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate privilege, gain unauthorized access, or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products using Nozomi Guardian/CMC before 23.4.1, are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOMAPE1808LNX (6GK6015-0AL200GH0): All versions\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808LNX CC (6GK60150AL20-0GH1): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nAudit records for OpenAPI requests may include sensitive information. This could lead to unauthorized accesses and privilege escalation.\nCVE-2023-6916 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA Denial of Service (Dos) vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian, caused by improper input validation in certain fields used in the Radius parsing functionality of our IDS, allows an unauthenticated attacker sending specially crafted malformed network packets to cause the IDS module to stop updating nodes, links, and assets. Network traffic may not be analyzed until the IDS module is restarted.\nCVE-2024-0218 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808LNX (6GK6015-0AL200GH0) and RUGGEDCOM APE1808LNX CC (6GK60150AL20-0GH1): Upgrade Nozomi Guardian/CMC to V23.4.1. Contact customer support to receive patch and update information.\nFor CVE-2023-6916: Create specific users for OpenAPI usage, with minimal permissions. Limit API keys to allowed IP addresses. Regenerate existing API keys periodically and to review sign-ins via API keys in the audit records\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-292022 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
