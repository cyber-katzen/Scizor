Kabona AB has produced an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Martin Jartelius has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following WebDatorCentral versions are affected:\n\nAll WDC versions prior to Version 3.4.0\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary code in a specially crafted URL. This request would grant the attacker the access to the application. This access would include the ability to obtain data from the web server application and redirect users to other potentially malicious pages.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nKabona AB is a Sweden-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including Sweden and the UK.\nThe affected product, WDC, is a web-based SCADA system. According to Kabona AB, WDC is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities. Kabona AB estimates that these products are used primarily in Sweden with a small percentage in other parts of Europe and Canada.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, web site last accessed October 13, 2016.\n\nThe web server URL inputs are not sanitized correctly, which may allow cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\nCVE-2016-8356NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8356, web site last accessed November 7, 2017. has been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 7, 2017.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would not be difficult. Social engineering is required for one vulnerability to convince the user to accept the malformed file or links. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file or access the link. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nKabona AB recommends updating to the latest version of WDC software. Information on updating can be obtained through the vendor by contacting their support representatives at:service@kabona.com\nPhone: +46 10 219 36 50\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed October 13, 2016. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed October 13, 2016. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
