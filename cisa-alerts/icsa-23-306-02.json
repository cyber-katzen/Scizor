[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryMitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ\\-F/iQ\\-R Series CPU Module (Update A)=================================================================== Last Revised February 15, 2024 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-306\\-02**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.3*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Equipment**  : MELSEC iQ\\-F/iQ\\-R Series* **Vulnerability**  : Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging into the web server function for a certain period, resulting in a denial\\-of\\-service condition. The impact of this vulnerability will persist while the attacker continues to attempt the attack.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ\\-F/iQ\\-R Series products are affected (Products with \\* are sold in limited regions):* FX5U\\-xMy/z x\\=32,64,80, y\\=T,R, z\\=ES,DS,ESS,DSS (Serial number 17X\\*\\*\\*\\* and later): All versions* FX5U\\-xMy/z x\\=32,64,80, y\\=T,R, z\\=ES,DS,ESS,DSS (Serial number 179\\*\\*\\*\\* and prior): Versions 1\\.060 or later* FX5UC\\-xMy/z x\\=32,64,96, y\\=T, z\\=D,DSS (Serial number 17X\\*\\*\\*\\* and later): All versions* FX5UC\\-xMy/z x\\=32,64,96, y\\=T, z\\=D,DSS (Serial number 179\\*\\*\\*\\* and prior): Versions 1\\.060 or later* FX5UC\\-32MT/DS\\-TS, FX5UC\\-32MT/DSS\\-TS, FX5UC\\-32MR/DS\\-TS: All versions* FX5UJ\\-xMy/z x\\=24,40,60, y\\=T,R, z\\=ES,DS,ESS,DSS: All versions* FX5UJ\\-xMy/ES\\-A\\* x\\=24,40,60, y\\=T,R: All versions* FX5S\\-xMy/z x\\=30,40,60,80\\*, y\\=T,R, z\\=ES,ESS: All versions* R00/01/02CPU: Versions 05 or later* R04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU: Versions 35 or later* R08/16/32/120/PCPU: Versions 37 or later### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE\\-307](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)** A denial\\-of\\-service vulnerability exists in the web server function of the MELSEC iQ\\-F/iQ\\-R Series CPU module, which could allow an attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging in to the web server function for a certain period of time. The impact of this vulnerability will persist while the attacker continues to attempt the attack.[CVE\\-2023\\-4625](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-4625)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Peter Cheng from ELEX FEIGONG RESEARCH INSTITUTE of Elex Cybersecurity, Inc. reported this vulnerability to Mitsubishi Electric.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends that users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk:* Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.* Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Use IP filter function to block access from untrusted hosts. For details on the IP filter function, following manual for each product; \"12\\.1 IP Filter Function\" in the MELSEC iQ\\-F FX5 User's Manual (Ethernet Communication), \"1\\.13 Security\" \u2013 \"IP Filter\" in the MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application).* Restrict physical access to the affected products and the LAN that is connected by them. For additional information refer to Mitsubishi Electric's security bulletin [2023\\-014\\_en](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2023-014_en.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  .
