EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nEquipment: MELSEC iQ-F/iQ-R Series\nVulnerability: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging into the web server function for a certain period, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The impact of this vulnerability will persist while the attacker continues to attempt the attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-F/iQ-R Series products are affected (Products with * are sold in limited regions):\n\nFX5U-xMy/z x=32,64,80, y=T,R, z=ES,DS,ESS,DSS (Serial number 17X**** and later): All versions\nFX5U-xMy/z x=32,64,80, y=T,R, z=ES,DS,ESS,DSS (Serial number 179**** and prior): Versions 1.060 or later\nFX5UC-xMy/z x=32,64,96, y=T, z=D,DSS (Serial number 17X**** and later): All versions\nFX5UC-xMy/z x=32,64,96, y=T, z=D,DSS (Serial number 179**** and prior): Versions 1.060 or later\nFX5UC-32MT/DS-TS, FX5UC-32MT/DSS-TS, FX5UC-32MR/DS-TS: All versions\nFX5UJ-xMy/z x=24,40,60, y=T,R, z=ES,DS,ESS,DSS: All versions\nFX5UJ-xMy/ES-A* x=24,40,60, y=T,R: All versions\nFX5S-xMy/z x=30,40,60,80*, y=T,R, z=ES,ESS: All versions\nR00/01/02CPU: Versions 05 or later\nR04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU: Versions 35 or later\nR08/16/32/120/PCPU: Versions 37 or later\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nA denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the web server function of the MELSEC iQ-F/iQ-R Series CPU module, which could allow an attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging in to the web server function for a certain period of time. The impact of this vulnerability will persist while the attacker continues to attempt the attack.\nCVE-2023-4625\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPeter Cheng from ELEX FEIGONG RESEARCH INSTITUTE of Elex Cybersecurity, Inc. reported this vulnerability to Mitsubishi Electric.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends that users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk:\n\nUse a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\nUse IP filter function to block access from untrusted hosts. For details on the IP filter function, following manual for each product; \"12.1 IP Filter Function\" in the MELSEC iQ-F FX5 User's Manual (Ethernet Communication), \"1.13 Security\" \u2013 \"IP Filter\" in the MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application).\nRestrict physical access to the affected products and the LAN that is connected by them.\n\nFor additional information refer to Mitsubishi Electric's security bulletin\u00a02023-014_en.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nNovember 02, 2023: Initial Publication\nFebruary 15, 2024: Update A - Updated all iterations of MELSEC iQ-F to MELSEC iQ-F/iQ-R throughout the document, added iQ-R products and versions to Affected Products section, and additional mitigations in Mitigation Section.\n\n",
