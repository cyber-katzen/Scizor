EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3: 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: JT2Go, Teamcenter Visualization\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, NULL Pointer Dereference, Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the software's current process or crash the application causing a denial of service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nJT2Go: All versions prior to V14.3.0.6\nTeamcenter Visualization V13.3: All versions prior to V13.3.0.13\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.1: All versions prior to V14.1.0.12\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.2: All versions prior to V14.2.0.9\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.3: All versions prior to V14.3.0.6\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected applications contain an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted CGM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-51439\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe affected applications contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing specially crafted CGM files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial of service condition.\nCVE-2023-51744\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected applications contain a stack overflow vulnerability while parsing specially crafted CGM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-51745\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.4\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected applications contain a stack overflow vulnerability while parsing specially crafted CGM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-51746\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update software to mitigate risk from these vulnerabilities.\n\nJT2Go: Update to V14.3.0.6 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V13.3: Update to V13.3.0.13 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.1: Update to V14.1.0.12 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.2: Update to V14.2.0.9 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.3: Update to V14.3.0.6 or later version\n\nSiemens also recommends that users avoid opening untrusted CGM files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJanuary 11, 2024: Initial Publication Date\n\n",
