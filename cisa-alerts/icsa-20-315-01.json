RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker-controlled OPC XML-DA Server to respond with a crafted XML message and exploit the PI Interface for OPC XML-DA, resulting in code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll versions of PI Interface for OPC XML-DA prior to 1.7.3.x are affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NUMERIC ERRORS CWE-189\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2013-0006 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nOSIsoft reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUpgrade to PI Interface for OPC XML-DA Version 1.7.3.x to remove this vulnerability.\nSecurity bulletin and access to security update is available on the OSIsoft customer portal (login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
