PTC recommends upgrading the following products to their latest versions where feasible:**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Rockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise should upgrade to [v13\\.01\\.00](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1136668)  or later**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * GE Digital Industrial Gateway Server should [upgrade to v7\\.612](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/GE-Digital-Security-Communication-GED-22-04-MFG?Type=Alert__kav)  or later* Software Toolbox TOP Server should [upgrade to v6\\.12](https://products.softwaretoolbox.com/top-server/download)  or later Users of these products should reach out to the associated vendors for any additional information or assistance with these products. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving [Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
