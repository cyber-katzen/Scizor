See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have observed persistent continued cyber intrusions by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors targeting U.S. think tanks. This malicious activity is often, but not exclusively, directed at individuals and organizations that focus on international affairs or national security policy.[1] The following guidance may assist U.S. think tanks in developing network defense procedures to prevent or rapidly detect these attacks.\nAPT actors have relied on multiple avenues for initial access. These have included low-effort capabilities such as spearphishing emails and third-party message services directed at both corporate and personal accounts, as well as exploiting vulnerable web-facing devices and remote connection capabilities. Increased telework during the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded workforce reliance on remote connectivity, affording malicious actors more opportunities to exploit those connections and to blend in with increased traffic. Attackers may leverage virtual private networks (VPNs) and other remote work tools to gain initial access or persistence on a victim\u2019s network. When successful, these low-effort, high-reward approaches allow threat actors to steal sensitive information, acquire user credentials, and gain persistent access to victim networks.\nGiven the importance that think tanks can have in shaping U.S. policy, CISA and FBI urge individuals and organizations in the international affairs and national security sectors to immediately adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement the critical steps listed in the Mitigations section of this Advisory.\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nATT&CK Profile\nCISA created the following MITRE ATT&CK profile to provide a non-exhaustive list of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by APT actors to break through think tanks\u2019 defenses, conduct reconnaissance in their environments, exfiltrate proprietary or confidential information, and execute effects on targets. These TTPs were included based upon closed reporting on APT actors that are known to target think tanks or based upon CISA incident response data.\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nValid Accounts

strengthen their security posture.\nLeaders\n\nImplement a training program to familiarize users with identifying social engineering techniques and phishing emails.\n\nUsers/Staff\n\nLog off remote connections when not in use.\nBe vigilant against tailored spearphishing attacks targeting corporate and personal accounts (including both email and social media accounts).\nUse different passwords for corporate and personal accounts.\nInstall antivirus software on personal devices to automatically scan and quarantine suspicious files.\nEmploy strong multi-factor authentication for personal accounts, if available.\nExercise caution when:\n\nOpening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. See Using Caution with Email Attachments.\nUsing removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).\n\n\n\nIT Staff/Cybersecurity Personnel\n\nSegment and segregate networks and functions.\nChange the default username and password of applications and appliances.\nEmploy strong multi-factor authentication for corporate accounts.\nDeploy antivirus software on organizational devices to automatically scan and quarantine suspicious files.\nApply encryption to data at rest and data in transit.\nUse email security appliances to scan and remove malicious email attachments or links.\nMonitor key internal security tools and identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known indicators of compromise or threat actor behaviors for immediate response.\nOrganizations can implement mitigations of varying complexity and restrictiveness to reduce the risk posed by threat actors who use Tor (The Onion Router) to carry out malicious activities. See the CISA-FBI Joint Cybersecurity Advisory on Defending Against Malicious Cyber Activity Originating from Tor for mitigation options and additional information.\nPrevent exploitation of known software vulnerabilities by routinely applying software patches and upgrades. Foreign cyber threat actors continue to exploit publicly known\u2014and often dated\u2014software vulnerabilities against broad target sets, including public and private sector organizations. If these vulnerabilities are left unpatched, exploitation often requires few resources and provides threat actors with easy access to victim networks. Review CISA and FBI\u2019s Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities and other CISA alerts that identify vulnerabilities exploited by foreign attackers.\nImplement an antivirus program and a formalized patch management process.\nBlock certain websites and email attachments commonly associated with malware (e.g., .scr, .pif, .cpl, .dll, .exe).\nBlock email attachments that cannot be scanned by antivirus software (e.g., .zip files).\nImplement Group Policy Object and firewall rules.\nImplement filters at the email gateway and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall.\nRoutinely audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account.\nFollow best practices for design and administration of the network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.\nImplement a Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) validation system.\nDisable or block unnecessary remote services.\nLimit access to remote services through centrally managed concentrators.\nDeny direct remote access to internal systems or resources by using network proxies, gateways, and firewalls.\nLimit unnecessary lateral communications.\nDisable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nEnsure applications do not store sensitive data or credentials insecurely.\nEnable a firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure any scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to suspicious or risky sites. Contact law enforcement or CISA immediately regarding any unauthorized network access identified.\nVisit the MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics pages linked in the ATT&CK Profile section above for additional mitigation and detection strategies for this malicious activity targeting think tanks.\n\n\nContact Information\n\nRecipients of this report are encouraged to contribute any additional information that they may have related to this threat. To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact.
