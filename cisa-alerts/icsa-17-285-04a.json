Existing licensees will be contacted about the update. Users can also contact NXP directly via email at\n [MQXsales@NXP.com](mailto:MQXsales@NXP.com) \n to get additional information as needed.\n* For MQX users running Version 4\\.2 and prior versions, NXP recommends that users obtain a patch or update to Version 5\\.1, which does not contain the out\\-of\\-bounds read vulnerability. Please contact NXP via email at\n [MQXsales@NXP.com](mailto:MQXsales@NXP.com) \n to get additional information as needed.\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part** \n**1** \n**of** \n**1** \n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n NCCIC also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n----------------------\n\n\n\n[BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n The Real\\-Time TCP/IP Communications Suite (RTCS) in MQX\u2019s DHCP client fails to sanitize all inputs, which may allow maliciously crafted DHCP packets to cause memory to be overwritten, allowing remote code execution.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-12718](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12718) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
