MITIGATIONS\nTreck\u00a0recommends users apply the latest version of the affected products (Treck TCP/IP 6.0.1.67 or later versions). To obtain patches, email security@treck.com\nFor more detailed information on the vulnerabilities and the mitigating controls, please see the Treck advisory. Additional vendors affected by the reported vulnerabilities have also released security advisories related to their affected products. Those advisories are as follows:\n\nABB\nB.Braun\nBaxter\nBD\nCareStream\nCaterpillar\nDIGI International\nEaton\nGreen Hills Software\nJohnson Controls\nMiele\nOpto 22\n\n--------- Begin Update H Part 2 of 3 ---------\n\nPepperl+Fuchs\n\n--------- End Update H Part 2 of 3 ---------\n\nRockwell\nSchneider Electric\nSmiths Medical\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n--------- Begin Update H Part 3 of 3 ---------\nThis vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n--------- End Update H Part 3 of 3 ---------\n",
