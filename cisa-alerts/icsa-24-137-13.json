MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSIMATIC BATCH V9.1: Update to V9.1.2.5 or later version\nSIMATIC PDM V9.2: Update to V9.2 SP2 Upd3 or later version\nSIMATIC Route Control V9.1: Update to V9.1.2.5 or later version\nSIMATIC WinCC OA V3.18: Update to V3.18 P025 or later version\nSIMATIC WinCC OA V3.19: Update to V3.19 P010 or later version\nSINAMICS Startdrive: Update to V19 SP1 or later version\nSINUMERIK ONE virtual: Update to V6.23 or later version\nTIA Portal Cloud Connector: Update to V2.0 or later version\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V19: Update to V19 Update 2 or later version\nSecurity Configuration Tool (SCT), SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.17, SIMATIC WinCC V7.4, Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V15.1, Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V16: Currently no fix is planned\nS7-PCT, SIMATIC Automation Tool, SIMATIC NET PC Software, SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1, SIMATIC STEP 7 V5, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V16, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V17, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V18, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V19, SIMATIC WinCC Unified PC Runtime, SIMATIC WinCC V7.5, SIMATIC WinCC V8.0, SINUMERIK PLC Programming Tool, Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V17, Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V18: Currently no fix is available\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-962515 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nMay 16, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
