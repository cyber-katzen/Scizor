For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u202fSiemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\u00a0\nView CSAF\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Parasolid\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens Parasolid, a 3D geometric modeling tool, are affected:\n\nParasolid V34.1: all versions prior to V34.1.258\nParasolid V35.0: all versions prior to V35.0.253\nParasolid V35.0: all versions prior to V35.0.260\nParasolid V35.1: all versions prior to V35.1.184\nParasolid V35.1: all versions prior to V35.1.246\nParasolid V36.0: all versions prior to V36.0.142\nParasolid V36.0: all versions prior to V36.0.156\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted X_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-41032\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted X_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-41033\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nParasolid V34.1: Update to\u00a0V34.1.258\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V35.0: Update to\u00a0V35.0.253\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V35.1: Update to\u00a0V35.1.184\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V36.0: Update to\u00a0V36.0.142\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V35.0: Update to\u00a0V35.0.260\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V35.1: Update to\u00a0V35.1.246\u00a0or later version\nParasolid V36.0: Update to\u00a0V36.0.156\u00a0or later version\nDo not open untrusted X_T files in Parasolid\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-190839 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this (these) vulnerability(ies), such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nSeptember 14, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
