This could allow an authenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or to control the program counter and execute arbitrary code on the device.\nCVE-2022-29872 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF PARAMETER/ARGUMENT DELIMITERS CWE-141\nThe affected devices do not properly validate parameters of certain GET and POST requests. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or to control the program counter and execute arbitrary code on the device.\nCVE-2022-29873 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected devices do not encrypt web traffic with clients but communicate in cleartext via HTTP. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to capture the traffic and interfere with the functionality of the device.\nCVE-2022-29874 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected devices do not properly handle the input of a GET request parameter. The provided argument is directly reflected in the web server response. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\nCVE-2022-29876 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected devices allow unauthenticated access to the web interface configuration area. This could allow an attacker to extract internal configuration details or to reconfigure network settings. However, the reconfigured settings cannot be activated unless the attacker achieves the role of authenticated administrator.\nCVE-2022-29877 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\nThe affected devices use a limited range for challenges sent during the unencrypted challenge-response communication. An unauthenticated attacker could capture a valid challenge-response pair generated by a legitimate user and request the webpage repeatedly to wait for the same challenge to reappear for the correct response to be revealed. This could allow the attacker to access the management interface of the device.\nCVE-2022-29878 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe web-based management interface of affected devices does not employ special access protection for certain internal developer views. This could allow authenticated users to access critical device information.\nCVE-2022-29879 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected devices do not properly validate input in the configuration interface. This could allow an authenticated attacker to place persistent XSS attacks to perform arbitrary actions in the name of a logged user who accesses the affected views.\nCVE-2022-29880 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe web-based management interface of affected devices does not employ special access protection for certain internal developer views. This could allow unauthenticated users to extract internal configuration details.\nCVE-2022-29881 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected devices do not handle uploaded files correctly. An unauthenticated attacker could take advantage of this to store an XSS attack, which could (when a legitimate user accesses the error logs) perform arbitrary actions in the name of the user.\nCVE-2022-29882 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe affected devices do not restrict unauthenticated access to certain pages of the web interface. This could allow an attacker to delete log files without authentication.\nCVE-2022-29883 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has recommended the following:\n\nUpdate SICAM P850 to Version 3.0 or later\nUpdate SICAM P855 to Version 3.0 or later\nDo not access links from untrusted sources while logged in to SICAM P850 or SICAM P855 devices\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-165073\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
