This could allow an authenticated attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or to control the program counter and execute arbitrary code on the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-29872](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29872)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF PARAMETER/ARGUMENT DELIMITERS CWE\\-141](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/141.html) The affected devices do not properly validate parameters of certain GET and POST requests. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or to control the program counter and execute arbitrary code on the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-29873](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29873)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html) The affected devices do not encrypt web traffic with clients but communicate in cleartext via HTTP. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to capture the traffic and interfere with the functionality of the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-29874](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29874)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) The affected devices do not properly handle the input of a GET request parameter. The provided argument is directly reflected in the web server response. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform reflected cross\\-site scripting (XSS) attacks.[CVE\\-2022\\-29876](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29876)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.5 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) The affected devices allow unauthenticated access to the web interface configuration area. This could allow an attacker to extract internal configuration details or to reconfigure network settings. However, the reconfigured settings cannot be activated unless the attacker achieves the role of authenticated administrator.[CVE\\-2022\\-29877](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29877)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.6 [AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE\\-REPLAY CWE\\-294](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html) The affected devices use a limited range for challenges sent during the unencrypted challenge\\-response communication. An unauthenticated attacker could capture a valid challenge\\-response pair generated by a legitimate user and request the webpage repeatedly to wait for the same challenge to reappear for the correct response to be revealed. This could allow the attacker to access the management interface of the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-29878](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29878)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.7 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) The web\\-based management interface of affected devices does not employ special access protection for certain internal developer views. This could allow authenticated users to access critical device information.[CVE\\-2022\\-29879](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29879)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.8 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) The affected devices do not properly validate input in the configuration interface. This could allow an authenticated attacker to place persistent XSS attacks to perform arbitrary actions in the name of a logged user who accesses the affected views.[CVE\\-2022\\-29880](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29880)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.9 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) The web\\-based management interface of affected devices does not employ special access protection for certain internal developer views.

An unauthenticated attacker could take advantage of this to store an XSS attack, which could (when a legitimate user accesses the error logs) perform arbitrary actions in the name of the user.[CVE\\-2022\\-29882](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29882)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
