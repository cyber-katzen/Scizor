EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 9\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n Siemens SICAM P850 and SICAM P855\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Improper Neutralization of Parameter/Argument Delimiters, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Cross\\-site Scripting, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Authentication Bypass by Capture\\-replay, Improper Authentication\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker management interface access, traffic capture, interface with the functionality of the device, control of the program counter, cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, loss of device information, and allow arbitrary code execution.\n \n\n\n3\\.
