EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 5.1\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: LOGO! V8.3 BM Devices\nVulnerability: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with physical access to an affected device to extract user-set passwords from an embedded storage IC.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSiemens LOGO! 12/24RCE (6ED1052-1MD08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 12/24RCEo (6ED1052-2MD08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 24CE (6ED1052-1CC08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 24CEo (6ED1052-2CC08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 24RCE (6ED1052-1HB08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 24RCEo (6ED1052-2HB08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 230RCE (6ED1052-1FB08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens LOGO! 230RCEo (6ED1052-2FB08-0BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCE (6AG1052-1MD08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCEo (6AG1052-2MD08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 24CE (6AG1052-1CC08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 24CEo (6AG1052-2CC08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCE (6AG1052-1HB08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCEo (6AG1052-2HB08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCE (6AG1052-1FB08-7BA1): All versions\nSiemens SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCEo (6AG1052-2FB08-7BA1): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE-256\nAffected devices store user passwords in plaintext without proper protection. This could allow a physical attacker to retrieve them from the embedded storage ICs.\nCVE-2024-39922 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39922. A base score of 5.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nCurrently no fix is planned\nEnsure the physical security of the affected devices to prevent unauthorized access (also see the operational guidelines for Industrial Security, especially: \"Plant security: Physical prevention of access to critical components\")\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-921449 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nAugust 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
