Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 as a zero day from at least April 2023 through July 2023 to gather information from several Norwegian organizations, as well as to gain access to and compromise a Norwegian government agency\u2019s network.\nIvanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability CVE-2023-35081 and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023. NCSC-NO observed possible vulnerability chaining of CVE-2023-35081 and CVE-2023-35078.\nCVE-2023-35078 is a critical vulnerability affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) (formerly known as MobileIron Core). The vulnerability allows threat actors to access personally identifiable information (PII) and gain the ability to make configuration changes on compromised systems. CVE-2023-35081 enables actors with EPMM administrator privileges to write arbitrary files with the operating system privileges of the EPMM web application server. Threat actors can chain these vulnerabilities to gain initial, privileged access to EPMM systems and execute uploaded files, such as webshells.\nMobile device management (MDM) systems are attractive targets for threat actors because they provide elevated access to thousands of mobile devices, and APT actors have exploited a previous MobileIron vulnerability. Consequently, CISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation in government and private sector networks.\nThis CSA provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained by NCSC-NO investigations. The CSA also includes a nuclei template to identify unpatched devices and detection guidance organizations can use to hunt for compromise. CISA and NCSC-NO encourage organizations to hunt for malicious activity using the detection guidance in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA. If no compromise is detected, organizations should still immediately apply patches released by Ivanti.\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n\nAA23-213A PDF\n(PDF,       492.43 KB\n  )\n\n\nDownload the .xml or .json file associated with this report:\n\n\nAA23-213A STIX XML\n(XML,       277.43 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAA23-213A STIX JSON\n(JSON,       250.01 KB\n  )\n\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nNote:\u00a0This advisory uses the\u00a0MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae for Enterprise\u00a0framework, version 13. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK\u2019s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA\u2019s Decider Tool.\nOverview\nIn July 2023, NCSC-NO became aware of APT actors exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core, to target a Norwegian government network. Ivanti confirmed that the threat actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 and released a patch on July 23, 2023.[1] Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability, CVE-2023-35081, and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023.[2]\nCVE-2023-35078 is a critical authentication bypass [CWE-288] vulnerability affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to specific application programming interface (API) paths. Threat actors with access to these API paths can access PII such as names, phone numbers, and other mobile device details of users on the vulnerable system; make configuration changes to vulnerable systems; push new packages to mobile endpoints; and access Global Positioning System (GPS) data if enabled.\nAccording to Ivanti, CVE-2023-35078 can be chained with a second vulnerability CVE-2023-35081.[2] CVE-2023-35081 is directory traversal vulnerability\u00a0[CWE-22] in EPMM. This vulnerability allows threat actors with EPMM administrator privileges the capability to write arbitrary files, such as webshells, with operating system privileges of the EPMM web application server. The actors can then execute the uploaded file.[2]\nCISA added CVE-2023-35078 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on July 25, 2023, and CVE-2023-35081 on July 31, 2023.\nCISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation of both vulnerabilities in government and private sector networks because MDM systems provide elevated access to thousands of mobile devices. Threat actors, including APT actors, have previously exploited a MobileIron vulnerability [3],[4].\nAPT Actor Activity\nThe APT actors have exploited CVE-2023-35078 since at least April 2023. The actors leveraged compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers, including ASUS routers, to proxy [T1090] to target infrastructure, and NCSC-NO observed the actors exploiting CVE-2023-35078 to obtain initial access to EPMM devices [T1190] and:\n\nPerform arbitrary Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries against the Active Directory (AD).\nRetrieve LDAP endpoints [T1018].\nUse API path /mifs/aad/api/v2/authorized/users to list users and administrators [T1087.002] on the EPMM device.\nMake EPMM configuration changes (Note: It is unknown what configuration changes the actors made).\nRegularly check EPMM Core audit logs [T1005].\n\nThe APT actors deleted some of their entries in Apache httpd logs [T1070] using mi.war, a malicious Tomcat application that deletes log entries based on the string in keywords.txt. The actors deleted log entries with the string Firefox/107.0.\nThe APT actors used Linux and Windows user agents with Firefox/107.0 to communicate with EPMM. Other agents were used; however, these user agents did not appear in the device logs. It is unconfirmed how the threat actors ran shell commands on the EPMM device; however, NCSC-NO suspects the actors exploited CVE-2023-35081 to upload webshells on the EPMM device and run commands [T1059].\nThe APT actors tunneled traffic [T1572] from the internet through Ivanti Sentry, an application gateway appliance that supports EPMM, to at least one Exchange server that was not accessible from the internet [T1090.001]. It is unknown how they tunneled traffic. NCSC-NO observed that the network traffic used the TLS certificate of the internal Exchange server. The APT actors likely installed webshells [T1505.003] on the Exchange server in the following paths [T1036.005]:\n\n/owa/auth/logon.aspx\n/owa/auth/logoff.aspx\n/owa/auth/OutlookCN.aspx\n\nNCSC-NO also observed mi.war on Ivanti Sentry but do not know how the actors placed it there.\nMITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES\nSee Table 1\u2014Table 7 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.\nTable 1: APT Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Initial Access\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application\nT1190\nThe APT actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 in public facing Ivanti EPMM appliances since at least April 2023.\n\n\n\nTable 2: APT Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Execution\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter\nT1059\nThe APT actors may have exploited CVE-2023-35081 to upload webshells on the EPMM device and run commands.\n\n\n\nTable 3: APT Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Discovery\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nAccount Discovery: Domain Account\nT1087.002\nThe APT actors exploited CVE-2023-35078\u00a0to gather EPMM device users and administrators.\n\n\nRemote System Discovery\nT1018\nThe APT actors retrieved LDAP endpoints.\n\n\n\nTable 4: APT Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Persistence\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nMasquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location\nT1036.005\nThe APT actors likely installed webshells at legitimate Exchange server paths.\n\n\nServer Software Component: Web Shell\nT1505.003\nThe APT actors implanted webshells on the compromised infrastructure.\n\n\n\nTable 5: APT Actor ATT&CK Techniques for Defense Evasion\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nIndicator Removal\nT1070\nAPT actors deleted httpd access logs after the malicious activities took place using string Firefox/107.0.\n\n\n\nTable 6: APT Actor ATT&CK Techniques for Collection\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nData from Local System\nT1005\nAPT actors regularly checked EPMM Core audit logs.\n\n\n\nTable 7: APT Actor ATT&CK Techniques for Command and Control\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nProtocol Tunneling\nT1572\nThe APT actors tunneled traffic from the internet to an Exchange server that was not accessible from the internet.\n\n\nProxy\nT1090\n\nThe actors leveraged compromised SOHO routers to proxy to and compromise infrastructure.\nThe actors tunneled traffic from the internet to at least one Exchange server.\n\n\n\nProxy: Internal Proxy\nT1090.001\nThe APT actors tunneled traffic from the internet to an Exchange server that was not accessible from the internet.\n\n\n\nEVIDENCE OF VULNERABILITY METHODS\nCISA recommends administrators use the following CISA-developed nuclei template to determine vulnerability to CVE-2023-30578:\n\n\n\n\nid: CVE-2023-35078-Exposure\n\u00a0\ninfo:\n\u00a0 name: Ivanti EPMM Remote Unauthenticated API Access\n\u00a0 author: JC\n\u00a0 severity: critical\n\u00a0 reference:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -

The LDAP queries performed by EPMM when the threat actor used the MIFS API generated tens of millions of this event code. Also look for EventCodes 4662, 5136, and 1153.\nTo detect tunneling activity through Sentry, look for traffic from EPMM devices to other internal servers, as well as TLS traffic towards instances of EPMM with different TLS certificates than the instance itself would possess. Traffic to EPMM with certificates originating from endpoints further inside the network, e.g. standard Windows generated certificates such as CN=EXCHANGE01 or similar.\nPerform forensic analysis of disk and memory since log retention may be poor and threat actors have been observed deleting log entries. Pay particular attention to unallocated disk space (free space on filesystem).\nCheck for activity from ASUS routers in your own country towards EPMM and Sentry devices.\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE\nIf compromise is detected, organizations should:\n\nQuarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.\nReimage compromised hosts.\nProvision new account credentials.\nCollect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.\nReport the compromise to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov\u00a0or 888-282-0870) or to NCSC-NO via NCSC-NO's 24/7 Operations Center (cert@ncsc.no or +47 23 31 07 50).\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCISA and NCSC-NO recommend organizations:\n\nUpgrade Ivanti EPMM versions to the latest version as soon as possible. See Ivanti CVE-2023-35081 - Remote Arbitrary File Write for patch information. This patch protects against CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081.\n\nSee the Evidence of Vulnerability Methods section of this advisory for CISA-developed nuclei templates to find any EPMM versions vulnerable to CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081.\nOrganizations using unsupported versions (i.e., versions prior to 11.8.1.0) should immediately upgrade to a supported version. If you cannot immediately upgrade, apply the Ivanti-provided RPM fix for CVE-35078 (this workaround does not protect against CVE-2023-35081):\n\nLogin to command line shell (CLI) in enable mode.\nRun the following command: # install rpm url https://support.mobileiron.com/ivanti-updates/ivanti-security-update-1.0.0-1.noarch.rp\nSee Ivanti\u2019s Knowledge Base (KB) Remote unauthenticated API access vulnerability - CVE-2023-35078 for more information on the RPM fix.\n\n\n\n\nTreat MDM systems as high-value assets (HVAs) with additional restrictions and monitoring. MDM systems provide elevated access to thousands of hosts and should be treated as high value assets (HVAs) with additional restrictions and monitoring.\nFollow best cybersecurity practices in production and enterprise environments, including mandating phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all staff and services. For additional best practices, see CISA\u2019s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs). The CPGs, developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are a prioritized subset of IT and OT security practices that can meaningfully reduce the likelihood and impact of known cyber risks and common TTPs. Because the CPGs are a subset of best practices, CISA and NCSC-NO also recommend software manufacturers implement a comprehensive information security program based on a recognized framework, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).\n\nVALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\nIn addition to applying mitigations, CISA and NCSC-NO recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.\nTo get started:\u00a0\n\nSelect an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1\u2013Table 7).\nAlign your security technologies against the technique.\nTest your technologies against the technique.\nAnalyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\nRepeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\nTune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\nCISA recommends continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Ivanti: CVE-2023-35078 \u2013 Remote Unauthenticated API Access Vulnerability\n[2] Ivanti: CVE-2023-35081
