The researchers emphasize that the vulnerability is not with the DNP3 stack but with the implementation.\nThe research showed that some implementations were third-party components in other software packages. ICS-CERT wants to bring greater awareness to developers and consumers of the third\u2011party components for mitigation purposes.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely (over an IP-based implementation) as well as from the local system (through a serial-based implementation).\nBelow is a nonexhaustive list of advisories that ICS-CERT has produced in conjunction with the vendors who are producing patches or updates to mitigate the reported vulnerability.\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 1 --------\n\nDNP3 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION VULNERABILITY\n\n\nAdvisory Number\nVendor\n\n\nICSA-13-282-01A \nAlstrom\n\n\nICSA-13-297-01 \nCatapult Software\n\n\nICSA-13-346-01 \nCooper Power Systems\n\n\nICSA-13-346-02 \nCooper Power Systems/Cybectec\n\n\nICSA-13-337-01 \nElecsys\n\n\nICSA-13-297-02 \nGE\n\n\nICSA-13-161-01 \nIOServer\n\n\nICSA-13-213-03 \nIOServer\n\n\nICSA-13-226-01 \nKepware Technologies\n\n\nICSA-13-213-04A \nMatrikonOPC\n\n\nICSA-13-352-01 \nNovaTech\n\n\nICSA-14-098-01 \nOSISoft\n\n\nICSA-14-006-01 \nSchneider Electric\n\n\nICSA-14-014-01 \nSchneider Electric\n\n\nICSA-13-219-01 \nSchweitzer Engineering Laboratories\n\n\nICSA-13-234-02 \nSoftware Toolbox\n\n\nICSA-13-252-01 \nSUBNET Solutions\n\n\nICSA-13-240-01 \nTriangle MicroWorks\n\n\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 ----------\nIMPACT\nThe outstation/slave can be sent into an infinite loop or Denial of Service condition by sending a specially crafted TCP packet from the master station on an IP-based network. If the device is connected via a serial connection, the same attack can be accomplished with physical access to the master station. The device must be shut down and restarted to reset the loop state.\nThe master station can be sent into an infinite loop by sending a specially crafted TCP packet from the outstation/slave on an IP-based network. If the device is connected via a serial connection, the same attack can be accomplished with physical access to the outstation. The device must be shut down and restarted to reset the loop state.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdam Crain of Automatak, working with Chris Sistrunk, Sr. Consultant for Mandiant, disclosed this vulnerability as part of a larger research project. Their outreach stems from their work with the DNP3 Standards Working group.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nAs this vulnerability affects Internet protocol-connected and serial-connected devices, two CVSS scores have been calculated.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION-IP-BASEDCWE-20: Improper Input Validation,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed October 18, 2013.\n\nAn attacker could cause the software to go into an infinite loop with a specifically crafted TCP packet, causing the process to crash. The system must be restarted manually to clear the condition.\nThe following scoring is for IP-connected devices.\nA CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed October 18, 2013.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION-Serial-BASEDCWE-20: Improper Input Validation,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed October 18, 2013.\n\nAn attacker could cause the software to go into an infinite loop, causing the process to crash. The system must be restarted manually to clear the condition.\nThe following scoring is for serial-connected devices.\nA CVSS v2 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed October 18, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThe IP-based vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nThe serial-based vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. Local access to the serial-based outstation is required.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill could craft an IP packet that would be able to exploit this vulnerability for an IP-based device.\nAn attacker with a high skill could exploit the serial-based vulnerability because physical access to the device or some amount of social engineering is required.\nMITIGATION\nBecause this vulnerability is identified with fuzzing tools, the researchers suggest developers use extensive negative testing during quality control of products. The researchers also suggest blocking DNP3 traffic from traversing onto business or corporate networks through the use of an IPS or firewall with DNP3-specific rule sets.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
