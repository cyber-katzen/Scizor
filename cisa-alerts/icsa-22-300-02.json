EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: SAUTER Controls\u00a0\nEquipment: moduWeb\u00a0\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to trick users into clicking on malicious links and steal sensitive information.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of SAUTER moduWeb firmware, web services used to monitor Building and Control networks and devices, are affected:\u00a0\n\nSAUTER moduWeb firmware Version 2.7.1\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79 \u00a0\nSAUTER Controls moduWeb firmware version 2.7.1 is vulnerable to reflective cross-site scripting (XSS). The web application does not adequately sanitize request strings of malicious JavaScript. An attacker utilizing XSS could then execute malicious code in users\u2019 browsers and steal sensitive information, including user credentials.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40190 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIthaca Labs of Odyssey Cyber Security reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSAUTER Controls has provided the following update for users to mitigate this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\nSAUTER moduWeb firmware: Version 3.1.3 or later\u00a0\n\nUpdating the firmware requires SAUTER\u2019s software CASE Suite. Affected users should contact SAUTER for update instructions.\u00a0\nSAUTER strongly recommends users to take all necessary measures to protect the integrity of building automation network access, using all appropriate means and policies to minimize risks. It is further recommended to evaluate and upgrade legacy systems to current solutions where necessary.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. \u00a0\n",
