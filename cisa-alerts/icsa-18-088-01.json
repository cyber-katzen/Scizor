Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER RESOURCE SHUTDOWN OR RELEASE CWE-404\n\nA remote attack may take advantage of an improper implementation of the 3 way handshake during a TCP connection affecting the communications with commission and service tools. Specially crafted packets may also be sent to Port 2455/TCP/IP, used in Codesys management software, which may result in a denial-of-service condition of communications with commissioning and service tools.\nCVE-2018-8836 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\nRESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: United States, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, China, and India\n",
