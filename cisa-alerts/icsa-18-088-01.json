If updating the firmware is not feasible WAGO recommends that users disable the WAGO Service Communication via WBM or limit the access to Ports 6626 and 2455/TCP/IP to trusted devices. For more information see WAGO\u2019s security advisory:[Vulnerability\\-in\\-the\\-WAGO\\-Ethernet\\-TCP\\-IP\\-driver.pdf](https://www.wago.com/medias/Vulnerability-in-the-WAGO-Ethernet-TCP-IP-driver.pdf?context=bWFzdGVyfHJvb3R8MjgxNDk0fGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL3BkZnxoOTcvaDhkLzkxNTAyMjMyMjA3NjYucGRmfGRlNWQ4ODc0NTE5M2UyNTUwNTIyNDRlOWFkNWI2YjNkMzg0YTVhYzlmYTBjNzM4MDdmNmYzOTM5M2ZlMGEzNzE)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER RESOURCE SHUTDOWN OR RELEASE CWE\\-404](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/404.html)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A remote attack may take advantage of an improper implementation of the 3 way handshake during a TCP connection affecting the communications with commission and service tools. Specially crafted packets may also be sent to Port 2455/TCP/IP, used in Codesys management software, which may result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition of communications with commissioning and service tools.[CVE\\-2018\\-8836](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8836)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).RESEARCHER---------- Younes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.BACKGROUND----------**Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems**Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide**Company Headquarters Location:**  United States, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, China, and India This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.Vendor------* WAGO-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-18-088-01)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01) Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02) Jul 16, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01) Jul 11, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
