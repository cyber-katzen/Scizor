EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Fuji Electric\nEquipment: V-Server Lite\nVulnerability: Classic Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to view sensitive information and disrupt the availability of the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of V-Server Lite, a data collection and management service, are affected:\n\nV-Server Lite 4.0.3.0 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nA maliciously crafted project file may cause a buffer overflow, which may allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2018-10637 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAriele Caltabiano (kimiya) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFuji Electric has produced firmware update v4.0.4.0, which can be obtained here:\nhttp://monitouch.fujielectric.com/site/support-e/download-index-01.html\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
