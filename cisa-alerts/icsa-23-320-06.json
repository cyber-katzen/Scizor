EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC PCS neo\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, SQL Injection, Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to generate a privileged token and upload additional documents, execute SQL statements, trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior, and inject Javascript code into the application that is later executed by another legitimate user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC PCS neo: Versions prior to V4.1\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe PUD Manager of affected products does not properly authenticate users in the PUD Manager web service. This could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to generate a privileged token and upload additional documents.\nCVE-2023-46096\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nThe PUD Manager of affected products does not properly neutralize user provided inputs. This could allow an authenticated adjacent attacker to execute SQL statements in the underlying database.\nCVE-2023-46097\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0PERMISSIVE CROSS-DOMAIN POLICY WITH UNTRUSTED DOMAINS CWE-942\nWhen accessing the Information Server from affected products, the products use an overly permissive CORS policy. This could allow an attacker to trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior.\nCVE-2023-46098\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThere is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Administration Console of the affected product, that could allow an attacker with high privileges to inject Javascript code into the application that is later executed by another legitimate user.\nCVE-2023-46099\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released a new version for SIMATIC PCS neo and recommends to update to the latest version:\n\nSIMATIC PCS neo:\u00a0Update to V4.1\u00a0or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-456933 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nNovember 16, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
