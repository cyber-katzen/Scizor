EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix SAML Module\nVulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to disclose confidential data under certain circumstances.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Mendix SAML Modules:\u00a0\n\nMendix SAML Module (Mendix 7 compatible): all versions prior to v1.16.6\nMendix SAML Module (Mendix 8 compatible): all versions prior to v2.2.2\nMendix SAML Module (Mendix 9 compatible): all versions prior to v3.2.3\n\t\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611\nThe affected module is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks due to insufficient input sanitation. This may allow an attacker to disclose confidential data under certain circumstances.\nCVE-2022-32285 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated, the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIn certain configurations the SAML module is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient error message sanitation. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious code by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.\nCVE-2022-32286 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated, the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMendix has released an update for the Mendix SAML module and recommends updating to the latest versions:\u00a0\n\nMendix 7 compatible SAML Module: Update to v1.16.6 or later version.\nMendix 8 compatible SAML Module: Update to v2.2.2 or later version.\nMendix 9 compatible SAML Module: Update to v3.2.3 or later version. For applications upgraded to Mendix 9 from earlier Mendix versions, the issues have already been resolved in v3.2.2.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-740594:\n\nSSA-740594: PDF Version\nSSA-740594: TXT Version\nSSA-740594: CSAF Version\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
