[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens Mendix SAML Module========================== Last Revised June 16, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-167\\-041\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Mendix SAML Module* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to disclose confidential data under certain circumstances.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Mendix SAML Modules:* Mendix SAML Module (Mendix 7 compatible): all versions prior to v1\\.16\\.6* Mendix SAML Module (Mendix 8 compatible): all versions prior to v2\\.2\\.2* Mendix SAML Module (Mendix 9 compatible): all versions prior to v3\\.2\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE\\-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) The affected module is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks due to insufficient input sanitation. This may allow an attacker to disclose confidential data under certain circumstances.[CVE\\-2022\\-32285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.3 has been calculated, the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) In certain configurations the SAML module is vulnerable to cross\\-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient error message sanitation. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious code by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.[CVE\\-2022\\-32286](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32286)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.6 has been calculated, the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mendix has released an update for the Mendix SAML module and recommends updating to the latest versions:* Mendix 7 compatible SAML Module: [Update to v1\\.16\\.6 or later version](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1174/)  .* Mendix 8 compatible SAML Module: [Update to v2\\.2\\.2 or later version](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1174/)  .* Mendix 9 compatible SAML Module: [Update to v3\\.2\\.3 or later version](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1174/)  . For applications upgraded to Mendix 9 from earlier Mendix versions, the issues have already been resolved in v3\\.2\\.2\\. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  .
