  "markdown": "\nOverview\nIndependent researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle have identified a Path Traversal vulnerability in the Ecava IntegraXor application. Ecava has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability. The researchers have validated that the patch fixes this vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nAccording to Ecava, the following products are affected:\n\nIntegraXor versions older than Version 3.71.4200\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in file manipulation or arbitrary code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nEcava Sdn Bhd is a Malaysia-based software development company that provides the IntegraXor SCADA product. Ecava specializes in factory and process automation solutions.\nIntegraXor is a suite of tools used to create and run a web-based human-machine interface for a SCADA system.\nIntegraXor is currently used in several areas of process control in 38 countries with the largest installation based in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Poland, Canada, and Estonia.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nA path traversal vulnerability can occur when a specially crafted HTML document is opened on the Ecava IntegraXor server. Successful exploitation could allow file manipulation or arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is only exploitable while using Internet Explorer due to the proprietary Active X component. No other web browsers are affected by this vulnerability.\nCVE-2012-0246 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 4.3 has also been assigned.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability requires a medium skill level. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed HTML file.\nMitigation\nEcava recommends users to download and install update from their website.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
