Moxa has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Moxa OnCell versions are affected:\n\nOnCellG3470A-LTE,\nAWK-1131A/3131A/4131A Series,\nAWK-3191 Series,\nAWK-5232/6232 Series,\nAWK-1121/1127 Series,\nWAC-1001 V2 Series,\nWAC-2004 Series,\nAWK-3121-M12-RTG Series,\nAWK-3131-M12-RCC Series,\nAWK-5232-M12-RCC Series,\nTAP-6226 Series,\nAWK-3121/4121 Series,\nAWK-3131/4131 Series, and\nAWK-5222/6222 Series.\n\nIMPACT\nAn unauthorized user could download files by accessing a specific URL. An unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary command by web console.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMoxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.\nThe affected product, OnCell Security Software, is cellular IP gateways that can connect serial or Ethernet devices to a cellular network. According to Moxa, OnCell Security Software is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that this product is used primarily in Asia and Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER AUTHENTICATIONCWE-287: Improper Authentication, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html, web site last accessed November 03, 2016.\n\nAny user is able to download log files by accessing a specific URL.\nCVE-2016-8362NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8362, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 03, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nMoxa recommends that users disable HTTP/HTTPS after completing required configuration through web browser interface. Users can access via SNMP to enable HTTP/HTTPS if needed. If remote control or monitoring is required, users should enable \u201cIP Protocol Filter\u201d feature of OnCell/AWK products to prevent any unauthorized access to the administrative web management interface.\nMoxa has developed the following patch plan.\n\n\n\nProduct\nFirmware Update Release Date\n\n\n\n\nOnCellG3470A-LTE\nNovember 1, 2016\n\n\nAWK-1131A/3131A/4131A Series\nNovember 1, 2016\n\n\nAWK-3191 Series\nMay 31, 2017\n\n\nAWK-5232/6232 Series\nMay 31, 2017\n\n\nAWK-1121/1127 Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\nWAC-1001 V2 Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\nWAC-2004 Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\nAWK-3121-M12-RTG Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\nAWK-3131-M12-RCC Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\nAWK-5232-M12-RCC Series\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\n\nNo future updates are planned for the following models:\n\nTAP-6226 Series,\nAWK-3121/4121 Series,\nAWK-3131/4131 Series, and\nAWK-5222/6222 Series.\n\nUsers should contact Moxa if further assistance is needed for these models at:\nhttps://www.moxa.com/en/support/support/technical-support.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
