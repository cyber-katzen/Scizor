EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SCALANCE, RUGGEDCOM* **Vulnerability:**  Classic Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthenticated access to a device and cause a buffer overflow to execute custom code.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products are affected:* RUGGEDCOM RM1224: All versions prior to 6\\.3* SCALANCE M\\-800 / S615: All versions prior to 6\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT (\u2018CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW\u2019) CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html) The version of pppd shipped with this product has a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a stack buffer overflow, which may allow arbitrary code execution on the target system.[CVE\\-2020\\-8597](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8597)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends applying the following updates:* RUGGEDCOM RM1224: Update to [v6\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109781070)* SCALANCE M\\-800: Update to [v6\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109781070) Siemens has identified the following specific workaround and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Only use the PPP functionality of the affected devices in trusted environments. This functionality is not enabled by default but typically used in internet dial\\-in or point\\-to\\-point connection scenarios. At this point the vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious peer. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-809841](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-809841.pdf)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
