EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SCALANCE, RUGGEDCOM\nVulnerability: Classic Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthenticated access to a device and cause a buffer overflow to execute custom code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOM RM1224: All versions prior to 6.3\nSCALANCE M-800 / S615: All versions prior to 6.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT (\u2018CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW\u2019) CWE-120\nThe version of pppd shipped with this product has a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a stack buffer overflow, which may allow arbitrary code execution on the target system.\nCVE-2020-8597 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends applying the following updates:\n\nRUGGEDCOM RM1224: Update to v6.3\nSCALANCE M-800: Update to v6.3\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workaround and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nOnly use the PPP functionality of the affected devices in trusted environments. This functionality is not enabled by default but typically used in internet dial-in or point-to-point connection scenarios. At this point the vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious peer.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-809841\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
