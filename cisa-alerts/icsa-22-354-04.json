EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack\u00a0complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: MicroLogix 1100 and 1400\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could create a denial-of-service condition or allow for remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MicroLogix\u2014a line of programmable logic controllers (PLCs)\u2014are affected:\n\nMicroLogix 1100: all versions\nMicroLogix 1400 A: Versions 7.000 and prior\nMicroLogix 1400 B/C: Versions 21.007 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected products have an unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the embedded webserver. The payload is transferred to the controller over simple network management protocol (SNMP) and is rendered on the homepage of the embedded website. Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.\nCVE-2022-46670 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021\nThe affected products have a clickjacking vulnerability where an attacker with network access to the affected systems could send TCP packets to the webserver, closing it abruptly. This could cause a denial-of-service condition for the web server application on the device.\nCVE-2022-3166 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users of the affected products to take the following actions:\n\nDisable the web server, if possible (This component is an optional feature and disabling it will not disrupt the intended use of the device)\u00a0\nConfigure firewalls to disallow network communication through HTTP/Port 802\nUpgrade to the MicroLogix 800 or MicroLogix 850 as this device does not have the web server component\n\nRockwell Automation also recommends users to employ cybersecurity best practices, as outlined in their Knowledgebase article.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
