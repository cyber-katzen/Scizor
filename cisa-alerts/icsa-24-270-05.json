RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the communications between the affected devices.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin, a mesh networking device, are affected:\n\ngoTenna Pro ATAK Plugin: Versions 1.9.12 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Weak Password Requirements CWE-521\nThe goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin uses a weak password for the QR broadcast message. If the QR broadcast message is captured over RF it is possible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast.\nCVE-2024-45374 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-45374. A base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information CWE-922\nIn the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on broadcast keys stored on the device.\nCVE-2024-43694 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-43694.

MITIGATIONS\ngoTenna recommends that users mitigate these vulnerabilities by performing the following updates:\n\nATAK Plugin: v2.0.7 or greater\n\ngoTenna recommends that users follow these mitigations:\nGeneral Mitigations for All Users/Clients\n\nUse Discreet Callsigns and Key Names: Choose callsigns and key names that do not disclose sensitive information, such as your location, team size, or team name. Avoid using any identifiers that could inadvertently reveal your location or the composition of your team.\nSecure End-User Devices: Implement strong security measures on all end-user devices, including the use of encryption and ensuring regular software updates.\nFollow Key Rotation Best Practices: Regularly rotate encryption keys according to industry best practices to maintain ongoing security.\n\nPro-Specific Mitigations\n\nShare Encryption Keys via QR Code: Utilize QR codes, similar to ATAK, for the secure exchange of encryption keys.\nSecure Broadcasting: When broadcasting, ensure you are in a secured area and transmit the key at a reduced power of 0.5 Watts to limit exposure.\nLeverage Layered Encryption: Implement layered encryption keys to securely manage communications, whether interacting with individuals or teams.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact prosupport@gotenna.com\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nSeptember 26, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
