EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  JT2Go \\& Teamcenter Visualization* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-21\\-222\\-03 Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization that was published August 10, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an application crash or arbitrary code execution.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products are affected:* JT2Go: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.2* Teamcenter Visualization: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.2### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER CHECK FOR UNUSUAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE\\-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html) An improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions exists with the parsing DGN files from Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK, Version 2022\\.4 and prior, resulting from the lack of proper validation of the user\\-supplied data. This may result out\\-of\\-bounds conditions, allowing attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32946](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32946)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) An out\\-of\\-bounds write issue exists in the DGN file\\-reading procedure in the Drawings SDK, Version 2022\\.4 and prior, resulting from the lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32952](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32952)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.3 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) The plmxmlAdapterSE70\\.DLL library in affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-33738](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-33738)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Open Design Alliance, and Mat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has released updates for the following products:* JT2Go: [Update to v13\\.2\\.0\\.2](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html)  or later version* Teamcenter Visualization: [Update to v13\\.2\\.0\\.2](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  or later version (login required)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms.
