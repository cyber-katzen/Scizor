EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Circutor* **Equipment:**  COMPACT DC\\-S BASIC* **Vulnerability:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a buffer overflow condition resulting in remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Circutor COMPACT DC\\-S BASIC, a smart metering concentrator, are affected:* Circutor COMPACT DC\\-S BASIC: CIR\\_CDC\\_v1\\.2\\.17### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) A buffer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the firewall function of the device management web portal. The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker could submit any \"Address\" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a \"strcpy\" vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.[CVE\\-2022\\-1669](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1669)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Spain### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Angel Garcia Moreno reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Circutor has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate this vulnerability. Users of these affected products are invited to contact [Circutor customer support](https://circutor.com/en/contact/after-sales-and-technical-assistance/)  for additional information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
