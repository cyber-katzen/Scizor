[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryBoston Scientific ZOOM LATITUDE PRM Vulnerabilities=================================================== Last Revised October 19, 2017 Alert Code ICSMA\\-17\\-292\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Researchers Jonathan Butts and Billy Rios of Whitescope have identified two vulnerabilities in Boston Scientific\u2019s ZOOM LATITUDE Programmer/Recorder/Monitor (PRM) \u2013 Model 3120\\. Boston Scientific has provided compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following ZOOM LATITUDE PRM versions are affected:* ZOOM LATITUDE PRM \u2013 Model 3120, all versions.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with physical access to obtain patient health information (PHI). The affected device is not designed to be network accessible. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment and specific clinical usage.BACKGROUND---------- Boston Scientific is a US\\-based company that is headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The affected products, ZOOM LATITUDE PRMs, are portable cardiac rhythm management systems used to communicate with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. According to Boston Scientific, ZOOM LATITUDE PRMs are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sector. Boston Scientific asserts that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### USE OF HARD\\-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYa.

Boston Scientific has identified compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation and recommends that users implement the following measures:* Control access to the device and ensure all access is properly inventoried,* Maintain the device in a secure or locked location when not in use, and* Remove PHI prior to retiring or removing the device from the facility. Instructions for removing PHI are outlined in the operator\u2019s manual. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
