Boston Scientific has provided compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following ZOOM LATITUDE PRM versions are affected:\n \n\n\n* ZOOM LATITUDE PRM \u2013 Model 3120, all versions.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with physical access to obtain patient health information (PHI). The affected device is not designed to be network accessible.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment and specific clinical usage.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Boston Scientific is a US\\-based company that is headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts.\n \n\n\n\n The affected products, ZOOM LATITUDE PRMs, are portable cardiac rhythm management systems used to communicate with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. According to Boston Scientific, ZOOM LATITUDE PRMs are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sector. Boston Scientific asserts that these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### USE OF HARD\\-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYa. CWE\\-321: Use of Hard\\-coded Cryptographic Key, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321\\.html, web site last accessed October 19, 2017\\.\n\n\n\n\n The affected device uses a hard\\-coded cryptographic key to encrypt PHI prior to having it transferred to removable media.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2017\\-14014b. NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2017\\-14014, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).c. CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed October 19, 2017\\.\n \n\n\n\n### MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATAd. CWE\\-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311\\.html, web site last accessed October 19, 2017\\.\n\n\n\n\n The affected device does not encrypt PHI at rest.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2017\\-14012e. NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2017\\-14012, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).f. CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed October 19, 2017\\.\n \n\n\n### VULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\n\n#### EXPLOITABILITY\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities are not remotely exploitable and require physical access.\n \n\n\n#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n#### DIFFICULTY\n\n\n\n An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n Boston Scientific will not be issuing a product update to address the identified vulnerabilities in the ZOOM LATITUDE PRM \u2013 Model 3120\\. Boston Scientific has identified compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation and recommends that users implement the following measures:\n \n\n\n* Control access to the device and ensure all access is properly inventoried,\n* Maintain the device in a secure or locked location when not in use, and\n* Remove PHI prior to retiring or removing the device from the facility. Instructions for removing PHI are outlined in the operator\u2019s manual.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n . ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Boston Scientific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-17-292-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Medical Advisory \\| ICSMA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Philips Vue PACS](/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jun 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Medical Advisory \\| ICSMA\\-24\\-163\\-01\n \n\n### [MicroDicom DICOM Viewer](/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-24-163-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 30, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Medical Advisory \\| ICSMA\\-24\\-151\\-02\n \n\n### [Baxter Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor](/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-24-151-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 30, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Medical Advisory \\| ICSMA\\-24\\-151\\-01\n \n\n### [Baxter Welch Allyn Configuration Tool](/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-24-151-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
