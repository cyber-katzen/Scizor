This could allow a remote attacker to create a denial-of-service condition that persists until the attack ends.\nCVE-2022-39158 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n\u202fSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n\u202fSiemens has released updates for the following products:\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RMC8388 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RS416Pv2 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RS416v2 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RS900 (32M) V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RS900G (32M) V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG907R V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG908C V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG909R V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG910C V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG920P V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG2100 (32M) V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG2288 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG2300 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG2300P V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSG2488 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RSL910 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RST916C V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RST916P V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RST2228 V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\nRUGGEDCOM ROS RST2228P V5.X: Update to V5.6.0 or later.\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nRestrict access to port 80/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only.\nDeactivate the webserver if not required and if deactivation is supported by the product.\n\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-459643 in HTML or CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
