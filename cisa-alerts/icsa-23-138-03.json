EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.7*** **ATTENTION:**  Public exploits are available* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600 Products* **Vulnerabilities:**  Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected product.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Hitachi Energy\u2019s MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600 products are affected:* SYS600: 9\\.4 FP2 Hotfix 5 and earlier* SYS600: 10\\.1\\.1 and earlier### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [Incorrect Authorization CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html)** The ActiveBar ActiveX control distributed in ActBar.ocx 1\\.0\\.3\\.8 in SYS600 product does not properly restrict the SetLayoutData method, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted data argument.[CVE\\-2011\\-1207](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-1207)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy has released the following mitigations/fixes:* SYS600 9\\.x: upgrade to at least SYS600 version 10\\.2 or apply general mitigation factors.* SYS600 10\\.x update to at least SYS600 version 10\\.2 or apply general mitigation factors. Hitachi Energy recommends general mitigation factors and workarounds:* Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network.* Keep process control systems physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Ensure process control systems have no direct connections to the internet, are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and other practices that must be evaluated case by case.* Avoid using process control systems for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.* Carefully scan portable computers and removable storage media for malware before connection to a control system.* Ensure proper password policies and processes are followed. Hitachi Energy recommends following the cybersecurity deployment guideline as follows: 1MRK511518 MicroSCADA X Cyber Security Deployment Guideline. For more information, see Hitachi Energy cybersecurity advisory [8DBD000142](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000142)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
