EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.7\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Public exploits are available\nVendor:\u00a0Hitachi Energy\nEquipment:\u00a0MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600 Products\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected product.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Hitachi Energy\u2019s MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600 products are affected:\n\nSYS600: 9.4 FP2 Hotfix 5 and earlier\nSYS600: 10.1.1 and earlier\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 Incorrect Authorization CWE-863\u00a0\nThe ActiveBar ActiveX control distributed in ActBar.ocx 1.0.3.8 in SYS600 product does not properly restrict the SetLayoutData method, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted data argument.\nCVE-2011-1207 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy has released the following mitigations/fixes:\n\nSYS600 9.x: upgrade to at least SYS600 version 10.2 or apply general mitigation factors.\nSYS600 10.x update to at least SYS600 version 10.2 or apply general mitigation factors.\n\nHitachi Energy recommends general mitigation factors and workarounds:\n\nRecommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network.\nKeep process control systems physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\nEnsure process control systems have no direct connections to the internet, are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and other practices that must be evaluated case by case.\nAvoid using process control systems for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.\nCarefully scan portable computers and removable storage media for malware before connection to a control system.\nEnsure proper password policies and processes are followed.\n\nHitachi Energy recommends following the cybersecurity deployment guideline as follows: 1MRK511518 MicroSCADA X Cyber Security Deployment Guideline.\u00a0\nFor more information, see Hitachi Energy cybersecurity advisory 8DBD000142.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
