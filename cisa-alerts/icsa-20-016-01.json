MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric has developed the following mitigations:\nSpecific Modicon M580 firmware v3.10 is available at:\u00a0\n\nBMEP584040\nBMEH584040 and C\nBMEP586040 and C\nBMEH586040 and C\nBMEP581020 and H\nBMEP582020 and H\nBMEP582040 and H\nBMEP583020\nBMEP583040\nBMEP584020\nBMEP585040 and C\nBMEH582040 and C\nBMEP584040S\nBMEH584040S\nBMEH586040S\nBMEP582040S\n\nModicon M340 firmware v3.20 is available at:\n\nBMXP3420302 and CL and H\nBMXP342020 and H\nBMXP342000\nBMXP341000 and H\nBMXP3420102 and CL\nBMXP3420302\n\nModicon Premium v3.20 firmware is available by contacting Schneider Electric customer support.\nModicon Quantum firmware v3.60 is available at:\n\n140CPU65150 [C] and 140CPU65160 [C]\n140CPU65260 [C]\n140CPU67261 [C]\n140CPU67060 [C]\n140CPU67160 [C]\n140CPU67260 [C]\n140CPU65860 [C]\n140CPU67861 [C]\n140CPU65160S\n\nPlease contact Schneider Electric customer support to get the Quantum v3.60 firmware\n\n\n140CPU67160S\n\nPlease contact Schneider Electric customer support to get the Quantum v3.60 firmware\n\n\n\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices such as:\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nPhysical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.\nAll controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\nAll programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for which the devices are intended.\nAll methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nLaptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability and the associated upgrade, please see Schneider Electric\u2019s SEVD-2019-344-01\nFor more details and assistance on how to protect during installation, please contact a Schneider Electric representative and/or Schneider Electric Industrial Cybersecurity Services. These organizations are aware of this situation and can support you through the process.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
