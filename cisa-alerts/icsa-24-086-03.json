RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the application or allow an attacker to run harmful code on the system.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Rockwell Automation reports that the following versions of Arena Simulation Software are affected:\n \n\n\n* Arena Simulation Software: version 16\\.00\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [Out\\-of\\-bounds Write CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An arbitrary code execution vulnerability could let a malicious user insert unauthorized code into the software. This is done by writing beyond the designated memory area, which causes an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2024\\-21912](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21912) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n A CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\n [CVE\\-2024\\-21912](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21912) \n .

Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2024\\-21913](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21913) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2024\\-2929](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-2929) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
