EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: Arena Simulation Software\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use After Free, Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Out-of-bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the application or allow an attacker to run harmful code on the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports that the following versions of Arena Simulation Software are affected:\n\nArena Simulation Software: version 16.00\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Out-of-bounds Write CWE-787\nAn arbitrary code execution vulnerability could let a malicious user insert unauthorized code into the software. This is done by writing beyond the designated memory area, which causes an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-21912\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21912. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based memory buffer overflow vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code into the software by overstepping the memory boundaries, which trigger an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-21913\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21913. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer CWE-119\nA memory corruption vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code to the software by corrupting the memory triggering an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-2929\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-2929. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0Use After Free CWE-416\nA memory buffer vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code to the software by corrupting the memory and triggering an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-21918\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21918. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0Access of Uninitialized Pointer CWE-824\nAn uninitialized pointer could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code to the software by leveraging the pointer after it is properly. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-21919\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21919. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0Out-of-bounds Read CWE-125\nA memory buffer vulnerability might let a threat actor read beyond the intended memory boundaries. This could reveal sensitive information and even cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.\nCVE-2024-21920\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21920.
