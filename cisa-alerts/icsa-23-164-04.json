MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation encourages affected software users to install one of the following security patches to address the associated risk:* [v13\\.00 Security Patch](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1138425/loc/en_US)* [v13\\.10 Security Patch](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1138425/loc/en_US) Users who are unable to update are directed towards the risk mitigation strategies provided below and are encouraged, when possible, to implement Rockwell Automation\u2019s suggested security best practices to minimize the risk.* Users should follow the instructions in the [Knowledgebase article BF29042](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1138425/loc/en_US)  to install the patch to mitigate the issue.* [Security Best Practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US#__highlight)  . Please see the [Rockwell Automation publication](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1139744)  regarding this issue for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
