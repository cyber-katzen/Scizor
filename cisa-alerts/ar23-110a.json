Analysis indicates this application was part of a supply chain attack against the commercial application 3CXDesktopApp. This malicious DLL was included within an installer for the 3CXDesktopApp. The primary purpose of this DLL is to steal information from various web browsers employed by a victim user. This malware is being referred to in open source as ICONICSTEALER. During runtime the application first attempts to read a file named \"\\\\3CXDesktopApp\\\\config.json\". Additionally, the malware attempts to collect the victim system's hostname, domain name, and OS version (Figure 1).\n\n\t\t\tThe malicious application next attempts to steal sensitive information from the victim user's web browser. Specifically it will target the Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Firefox browsers (Figure 2). It uses an embedded SQLITE library to query the browser databases for sensitive information (Figure 3). Analysis indicates the data stolen from the web browsers will be websites recently visited including sensitive parameters passed to the sites. These parameters could include sensitive information including login credentials or credit card numbers.\n\n\t\t\tNo exfiltration capability was discovered within this malicious application, indicating it works with another malicious component to exfiltrate collected data.\nScreenshots\n\n \n\n\nFigure 1 - This screenshot illustrates this malware attempting to access the file \\\\3CXDesktopApp\\\\config.json.\n\n \n\n\nFigure 2 - This screenshot illustrates web browsers targeted by this malware, known as ICONICSTEALER.\n\n \n\n\nFigure 3 - This screenshot illustrates the malware beginning to search through folders of various web browsers looking for the database files. The database files will be queried with an embedded SQLITE library looking for sensitive information.\n\n \n\n\nFigure 4 - This screenshot indicates the malware \"backs up\" the web browser databases before querying them for sensitive information. It may do this to prevent accidental corruption of the databases, or to prevent the browser from crashing if the user is currently browsing the web.\nRecommendations\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\nContact Information\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
