MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released [update v3\\.0 SP2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793790/)  for the SINEMA Remote Connect Server and recommends updating to the latest version. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For additional information, please refer to Siemens security advisory [SSA\\-911567](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-911567.pdf)  :* [SSA\\-911567: PDF Version](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-911567.pdf)* [SSA\\-911567: TXT Version](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-911567.pdf)* [SSA\\-911567: CSAF Version](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-911567.json) CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.
