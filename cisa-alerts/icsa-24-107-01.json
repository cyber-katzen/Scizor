RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges from unprivileged to SYSTEM privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ScadaPro, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, are affected:\n\nScadaPro: version 6.9.0.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe entire parent directory - C:\\ScadaPro and its sub-directories and files are configured by default to allow user, including unprivileged users, to write or overwrite files.\nCVE-2024-3746 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3746. A base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSharon Brizinov of Claroty Team82 reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMeasuresoft recommends that users manually reconfigure the vulnerable directories so that they are not writable by everyone.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nExercise principles of least privilege.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nApril 16, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
