EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: ARC Informatique\nEquipment: PcVue\nVulnerability: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-22-235-01 ARC Informatique PcVue that was published August 23, 2022, to the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access the OAuth web service database.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ARC Informatique product components are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nPcVue 12 OAuth web service configuration versions prior to 12.0.27\nPcVue 15 OAuth web service configuration versions prior to 15.2.3\n\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nPcVue 12 OAuth web service configuration\nPcVue 15 OAuth web service configuration\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-312\nThe affected device stores sensitive information in cleartext, which may allow an authenticated user to access session data stored in the OAuth database belonging to legitimate users.\nCVE-2022-2569 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n\u00a0\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nAn unnamed researcher reported this vulnerability to ARC Informatique.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nARC Informatique recommends users apply the following updates:\n\nPcVue 12: The fix is available in Maintenance release 12.0.27\n\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nPcVue 15: The fix is available in Maintenance release 15.2.3\nAfter installing either fix, ARC Informatique recommends doing the following:\nAfter installing the fix, users should update the Web Deployment Console (WDC) and re-deploy the Web Server.\u00a0\nAll users using the affected component should install a patched release of the WDC and re-deploy the Web Server. This will allow the WDC to update and protect the database connection string, including clearing any sensitive information stored in the web.config file.\n\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\n\n\n\nAfter installing the fix, users should update the Web Deployment Console (WDC) and re-deploy the Web Server.\u00a0\nAll users using the affected component should install a patched release of the WDC and re-deploy the Web Server. This will allow the WDC to update and protect the database connection string, including clearing any sensitive information stored in the web.config file.\n\n\nPcVue 15: A fix is forthcoming.\n\nARC Informatique has identified additional steps users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUninstall the Web Server\n\nAll users not using the affected component should uninstall the web server. The OAuth web service and its configuration are part of the Web Server for PcVue. If the system does not require Web & Mobile features, then users should not install them.\n\n\n\nUsers should contact ARC Informatique\u2019s PcVue Solutions for assistance with the above steps.\nFor additional information, visit the public ARC Informatique security alert page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\nAbout text formats Show row weights Vendor Vendor (value 1) ARC Informatique Vendor (value 2) Enter as many associated vendors as required, for example Honeywell Published Last saved 09/29/2022 - 10:39 Author ajohnson Create new revision Revisions are required.
