MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric has released Version 8\\.0\\.0 of ProClima and recommends users upgrade to this version or newer. Users may find the new version at the following location on the Schneider Electric website:[https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/product\\-range\\-download/2560\\-proclima/\\#tabs\\-top](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range-download/2560-proclima/#tabs-top\u00a0)  For more information on these vulnerabilities and the associated upgrade, please see Schneider Electric\u2019s SEVD\\-2019\\-162\\-01:[https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2019\\-162\\-01/](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2019-162-01/)  Schneider Electric recommends the following best cybersecurity practices for industry:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized person has access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.* All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for devices intended.* All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. For further information related to cybersecurity in Schneider Electric\u2019s products, please visit the company\u2019s cybersecurity webpage:[http://www2\\.schneider\\-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page](http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page)  If you require additional support, Schneider Electric Industrial Cybersecurity Services team is available to help.
