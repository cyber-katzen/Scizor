RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow access to sensitive information.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect all versions prior to 3\\.2\\.1 of the following SIMATIC RF6XXR UHF RFID products:* RF615R* RF68XR### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** The SSL protocol encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which may allow a man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack to obtain plaintext HTTP headers.[CVE\\-2011\\-3389](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-3389)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [CRYPTOGRAPIC ISSUES CWE\\-310](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html)** Long\\-duration TLS sessions used with a 64\\-bit block cipher may allow remote attackers to obtain cleartext data.[CVE\\-2016\\-6329](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-6329)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [CRYPTOGRAPIC ISSUES CWE\\-310](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html)** Outdated versions of TLS and DTLS allow statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, which may allow remote attackers to conduct distinguishing and plaintext\\-recovery attacks.[CVE\\-2013\\-0169](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0169)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS**  : Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED**  : Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION**  : Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Wendy Parrington from United Utilities reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users upgrade to Version 3\\.2\\.1 or newer for both affected products. Siemens also recommends users restrict network access to the device. For more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens\u2019 security advisory SSA\\-556833 at: [https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories.](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. High skill level is needed to exploit.
