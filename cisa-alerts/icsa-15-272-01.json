This vulnerability exists in all unsupported phased out versions of the application that is still in use by some customers. Honeywell has recommended users of the vulnerable versions upgrade to supported versions of the software, which have patches available.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Honeywell Experion PKS software releases are affected:\n\nRelease 310.x and below\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker may use this vulnerability to perform initial information disclosure, including access to credentials that could be used to escalate privileges.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nHoneywell is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide.\nThe affected product, certain versions of Experion PKS, is an advanced client-server distributed control system (DCS) architecture deployed across multiple critical and noncritical industries, including Energy and Chemical sectors.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nDIRECTORY TRAVERSALCWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html , web site last accessed September 29, 2015.\n\nThe affected products contain a directory traversal vulnerability that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges on the system to gain access to the host\u2019s root directory.\nCVE-2007-6483 NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-6483, web site last accessed September 29, 2015. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L). CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L, web site last accessed September 29, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nHoneywell recommends that customers using these versions upgrade to supported versions of Experion software. Since the vulnerable service remains installed, attention should be paid to ensuring that the Windows firewall remain enabled at all times.\u00a0 Enabling the Windows-based firewall and maintaining other safeguards can mitigate the risk.\nThe current status of Honeywell Experion support is:\n\nExperion R43x is in Primary Phase,\nExperion R41x is in Secondary Support phase,\nExperion R40x is in Legacy Support phase, and\nAll other versions are phased out.\n\nFor existing customers more information can be found on the Honeywell Process Solutions website (login required).\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nPrevious Recommendations can be used as needed (otherwise, delete this text).
