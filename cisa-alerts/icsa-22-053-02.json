MITIGATIONS--------------- Users are advised to refer to the [Secure Deployment Guide](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/cc_login?startURL=%2Fen_US%2FDocumentation%2FiFIX-Secure-Deployment-Guide)  on how to configure communication encryption. Users are encouraged to review the CIMPLICITY [Windows Hardening Guide and Recommendations](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/cc_login?startURL=%2Fen_US%2FDocumentation%2FWINDOWS-HARDENING-GUIDE-and-RECOMMENDATIONS-WINDOWS-SERVER-2012-R2)  for further IPSEC configuration guidance found in the section titled \u201cAppendix A IPSEC Configuration.\u201d Users are encouraged to [contact a GE representative](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/CC_Contact)  to obtain the latest versions of CIMPLICITY. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
