EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: GE\nEquipment: Proficy CIMPLICITY\nVulnerability: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to capture a connection session, resulting in disclosure of sensitive information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Proficy CIMPLICITY, an HMI and SCADA platform, are affected:\n\nProficy CIMPLICITY: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\u00a0\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected product is vulnerable due to cleartext transmission of credentials seen in the CIMPLICITY network, which can be easily spoofed and used to log in to make operational changes to the system.\nCVE-2022-21798 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYuval Ardon and Roman Dvorkin of OTORIO reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUsers are advised to refer to the Secure Deployment Guide on how to configure communication encryption.\nUsers are encouraged to review the CIMPLICITY Windows Hardening Guide and Recommendations for further IPSEC configuration guidance found in the section titled \u201cAppendix A IPSEC Configuration.\u201d\nUsers are encouraged to contact a GE representative to obtain the latest versions of CIMPLICITY.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
