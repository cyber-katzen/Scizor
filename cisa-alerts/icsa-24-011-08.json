EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SICAM A8000\nVulnerability: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated remote attacker to inject commands that are executed on the device with root privileges during device startup.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products, are affected:\n\nCP-8031 MASTER MODULE (6MF2803-1AA00): All versions prior to CPCI85 V05.20\nCP-8050 MASTER MODULE (6MF2805-0AA00): All versions prior to CPCI85 V05.20\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0USE OF UNINITIALIZED RESOURCE CWE-908\nThe network configuration service of affected devices contains a flaw in the conversion of ipv4 addresses that could lead to an uninitialized variable being used in succeeding validation steps. By uploading specially crafted network configuration, an authenticated remote attacker could be able to inject commands that are executed on the device with root privileges during device startup.\nCVE-2023-42797\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\nCP-8031 MASTER MODULE (6MF2803-1AA00):\n\nReview the list of users that are allowed to modify the network configuration and apply strong passwords.\nUpdate to\u00a0CPCI85 V05.20\u00a0or later version\n\nCP-8050 MASTER MODULE (6MF2805-0AA00):\n\nReview the list of users that are allowed to modify the network configuration and apply strong passwords.\nUpdate to\u00a0CPCI85 V05.20\u00a0or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-583634 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJanuary 11, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
