This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-3759](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3759) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode\\_init\\_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file\\-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE\\-2018\\-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-4037](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4037) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.55\n [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g., \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer, then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed, and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_ASN1\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_CMS\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_PKCS7\\_stream, SMIME\\_write\\_ASN1, SMIME\\_write\\_CMS and SMIME\\_write\\_PKCS7\\.

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e., the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon.
