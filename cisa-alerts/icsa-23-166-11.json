When the CVE\\-2022\\-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.[CVE\\-2022\\-2068](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2068)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.[CVE\\-2022\\-2097](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2097)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.[CVE\\-2022\\-2153](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2153)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. Due to the memory corruption, an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2022\\-2274](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2274)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

LoadPin builds on this property to restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device\\-mapper table reloads currently allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm\\-linear target and bypass verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for peripherals that do not verify firmware updates.

A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.54 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)** A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.55 [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)** The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g., \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer, then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed, and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO.

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e., the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon.

However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy() function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set\\_flags() with the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_POLICY\\_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.[CVE\\-2023\\-0466](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0466)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
