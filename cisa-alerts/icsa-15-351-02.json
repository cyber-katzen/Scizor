Sood has identified Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Motorola Solutions\u2019 MOSCAD IP Gateway. Motorola Solutions has confirmed this product was cancelled at the end of 2012 and no longer offer software updates.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following MOSCAD IP Gateway versions are affected:\n\nMOSCAD IP Gateway, all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nA successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to perform actions with the permissions of a valid user.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMotorola Solutions is a US-based company that maintains offices in 60 countries around the world.\nThe affected product, MOSCAD IP Gateway, is a SCADA system that has some web-based management capabilities. According to Motorola Solutions, MOSCAD IP Gateways, are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others.\nMotorola Solutions estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nREMOTE FILE INCLUSION CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html, web site last accessed December 17, 2015.\n\nFiles can be accessed and downloaded without authentication.\nCVE-2015-7935NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7935, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Specifically, users should:\n\nOnly use products that are currently maintained and supported by the manufacturer.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed December 17, 2015. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed December 17, 2015. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
