RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on the target system or cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens software is affected:\u00a0\n\nCOMOS V10.2: All versions\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.1: Versions prior to V10.3.3.1.45\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.2: Versions prior to V10.3.3.2.33\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.3: Versions prior to V10.3.3.3.9\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.4: Versions prior to V10.3.3.4.6\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.4.0.0: Versions prior to V10.4.0.0.31\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.4.1.0: Versions prior to V10.4.1.0.32\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.4.2.0: Versions prior to V10.4.2.0.25\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\u00a0\nCache validation service in COMOS is vulnerable to structured exception handler (SEH)-based buffer overflow. This could allow a malicious cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on the target system or cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-24482\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions:\u00a0\n\nCOMOS V10.4.2.0: Update to\u00a0V10.4.2.0.25\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.4.1.0: Update to\u00a0V10.4.1.0.32\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.4.0.0: Update to\u00a0V10.4.0.0.31\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.4: Update to\u00a0V10.3.3.4.6\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.3: Update to\u00a0V10.3.3.3.9\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.2: Update to\u00a0V10.3.3.2.33\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.3.3.1: Update to\u00a0V10.3.3.1.45\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nCOMOS V10.2: Currently no fix is planned\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following workarounds and mitigations users can apply to mitigate risk:\u00a0\n\nEnable structured exception handling overwrite protection (SEHOP) in the Windows operating system where COMOS is installed to protect against code execution. However, the application would remain vulnerable to denial-of-service condition attacks\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security webpage. \u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-693110 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
