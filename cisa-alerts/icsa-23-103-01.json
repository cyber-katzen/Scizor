For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.2\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\nEquipment:\u00a0Adaptec maxView Application\nVulnerability:\u00a0Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a local attacker to decrypt intercepted local traffic between the browser and the application. A local attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to modify data in transit.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC IPC1047: All versions \u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC1047E: All versions with Adaptec maxView Storage Manager prior to 4.09.00.25611 on Windows\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC647D: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC647E: All versions with Adaptec maxView Storage Manager prior to 4.09.00.25611 on Windows\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC847D: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC847E: All versions with Adaptec maxView Storage Manager prior to 4.09.00.25611 on Windows\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\u00a0\nThe Adaptec maxView application uses a non-unique TLS certificate across installations to protect communication from the local browser to the local application on affected Siemens devices. A local attacker could use this key to decrypt intercepted local traffic between the browser and the application and could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to modify data in transit.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23588\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple \u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdaptec has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. \u00a0Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available:\u00a0\n\nUpdate maxView Storage Manager to 4.09.00.25611\u00a0or later version.\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nUpdate the default self-signed device X.509 certificate with a trusted certificate.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines\u00a0for industrial security and to follow recommendations in the product manuals. \u00a0\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-511182 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
