[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryIntel 2G Modem============== Last Revised April 24, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-114\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.2*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely* **Vendor**  : Intel* **Equipment**  : Intel 2G Modem* **Vulnerability**  : Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow vulnerability may allow remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Intel 2G modem products where the earthquake tsunami warning system (ETWS) feature is enabled in modem firmware. Devices equipped with an affected modem, when connected to a rogue 2G base station where non\\-compliant 3GPP software may be operational, are potentially at risk.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products use the vulnerable Intel modem with 2G capability and ETWS enabled:* Intel XMM71xx* Intel XMM72xx* Intel XMM73xx* Intel XMM74xx* Sofia 3G* Sofia 3G\\-R* Sofia 3G\\-R W Versions that support 2G and the ETWS feature delivered to system manufactures prior to the disclosure of CVE\\-2018\\-3624 may be affected.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 3\\.2\\.1 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html) Buffer overflow in ETWS processing module allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via an adjacent network.[CVE\\-2018\\-3624](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-3624)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors**  : Communication, Information Technology* **Countries/Areas Deployed**  : Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location**  : United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Dr. Ralph Phillip Weinmann and Dr. Nico Golde from Comsecuris reported this vulnerability to Intel, and Intel reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Intel is making firmware updates available to device manufacturers that protect systems from this vulnerability. End users should check with their device manufacturers and apply any available updates as soon as practical. Intel has released the following security advisory:[https://security\\-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid\\=INTEL\\-SA\\-00116\\&languageid\\=en\\-fr](https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00116&languageid=en-fr)  NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website.](/ics/)  Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.
