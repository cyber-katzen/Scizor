EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: EIPStackGroup\nEquipment: OpENer EtherNet/IP\nVulnerabilities: Incorrect Conversion Between Numeric Types, Out-of-bounds Read, Reachable Assertion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service condition and data exposure.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of OpENer EtherNet/IP, are affected:\n\nhttps://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/ commits and versions prior to Feb 10, 2021\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT CONVERSION BETWEEN NUMERIC TYPES CWE-681\nA specifically crafted packet sent by an attacker to the affected devices may cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-27478 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA specifically crafted packet sent by an attacker may allow the attacker to read arbitrary data.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-27482 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nA specifically crafted packet sent by an attacker may result in a denial-of-service condition. \u00a0\nCVE-2021-27500 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nA specifically crafted packet sent by an attacker may result in a denial-of-service condition. \u00a0\nCVE-2021-27498 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Austria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTal Keren and Sharon Brizinov of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe maintainer of OpENer recommends those affected to apply the latest commits available.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
