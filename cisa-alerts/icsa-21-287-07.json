MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends upgrading SCALANCE W1750 to [Versions 8\\.7\\.1\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109802805/) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  SCALANCE W1750D: All version 8719 and prior (only affected by CVE\\-2019\\-5318, currently no fix is planned. SCALANCE W1750 versions from 8\\.7\\.1\\.3 to 9\\.7\\.1\\.8 update to [version 9\\.7\\.1\\.9](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109813747/)  or later (only affected by CVE\\-2019\\-5318, CVE\\-2020\\-37719, CVE\\-2021\\-37717, CVE\\-2021\\-37718, CVE\\-2021\\-37720, CVE\\-2021\\-37721, CVE\\-2021\\-37722, CVE\\-2021\\-37728\\).**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Block access to the ArubaOS Command Line Interface from all untrusted users.* Block access to the ArubaOS web\\-based management interface from all untrusted users.* Block access to the Mobility Conductor Command Line Interface from all untrusted users.* Enabling the Enhanced PAPI Security feature where available will prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Please contact TAC for assistance if needed.* Exploitation requires physical access. Controllers in strictly controlled physical environments are at low risk.* To minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, Aruba recommends the communication between Controller/Gateways and Access\\-Points be restricted either by having a dedicated Layer 2 segment/VLAN or, if Controller/Gateways and Access\\-Points cross Layer 3 boundaries, to have firewall policies restricting the communication of these authorized devices. In addition, enabling the Enhanced PAPI Security feature will prevent the PAPI\\-specific vulnerabilities above from being exploited. Contact Aruba Support for configuration assistance.* The RAPConsole or Local Debug (LD) homepage can be reached by users in a split or bridge role. This can be prevented by configuring an ACL to restrict access to the LD homepage, which effectively prevents this issue. Detailed [instructions for ACL](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ArubaOS_86_Web_Help/Content/arubaos-solutions/rap/rest-local-deb.htm)  implementation are available. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-280624 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-280624.html)  or [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-280624.json)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
