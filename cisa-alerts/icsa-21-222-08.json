[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens Solid Edge================== Last Revised August 19, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-21\\-222\\-081\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Solid Edge* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Use After Free, Access of Uninitialized Pointer2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead the application to crash, or to arbitrary code execution and data extraction on the target host system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Solid Edge are affected:* Solid Edge SE2021: All versions prior to SE2021MP7### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE\\-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) An XML external entity injection vulnerability in the underlying XML parser could cause the affected application to disclose arbitrary files to remote attackers by loading a specially crafted XML file.[CVE\\-2021\\-37178](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-37178)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) The PSKERNEL.DLL library in the affected application lacks proper validation while parsing user\\-supplied OBJ files that could lead to a use\\-after\\-free condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-37179](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-37179)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE\\-824](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html) The PSKERNEL.DLL library lacks proper validation while parsing user supplied OBJ files that could cause an out\\-of\\-bounds access to an uninitialized pointer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-37180](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-37180)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Xina1i, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, and Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for the following products:* Solid Edge SE2021: [Update to SE2021MP7](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  or later version (login required). Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:* Avoid opening files from unknown sources in Solid Edge. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information about this issue, please see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-818688](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-818688.pdf)  CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
