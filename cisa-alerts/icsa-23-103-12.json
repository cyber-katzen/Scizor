RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to potentially disclose confidential data.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens Polarion ALM products are affected:* Polarion ALM: all versions prior to V2304\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE\\-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)** The application contains an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem.[CVE\\-2023\\-28828](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28828)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Cale Anderson reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released an update for Polarion ALM and recommends updating to the [latest version (V2304\\.0\\)](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  , as well as updating specific configurations to mitigate against the vulnerability. The configuration changes to mitigate this vulnerability will be default in Polarion V2304 and later versions. Siemens recommends setting configurations as listed in [SSA\\-632164](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/txt/ssa-632164.txt)  to mitigate against external entity injection in OpenSAML 4\\.x parser. This will be included by default in \u00a0Polarion V2304 and later versions. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
