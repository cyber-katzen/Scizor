Schneider Electric has produced a firmware update that mitigates part of these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway\u2019s are affected:\n\nTSXETG3000 all versions,\nTSXETG3010 all versions,\nTSXETG3021 all versions, and\nTSXETG3022 all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerabilities allow unauthorized remote access to the gateway\u2019s files and FTP account.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in 190 countries worldwide.\u00a0\nThe affected product, ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway, is a web-based SCADA system. According to Schneider Electric, these gateways are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNAUTHENTICATED ACCESSCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.\n\nAccess to the rde.jar file containing configuration details is accessible without authentication. This could allow an attacker access to information on the setup and configuration of the gateway.\nCVE-2014-9197NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9197, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.\n\nFTP HARD-CODED CREDENTIALSCWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.\n\nThe ftp server of the device has hard-coded credentials. This could allow the attacker to access the service without proper authentication.\nCVE-2014-9198NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9198, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSchneider Electric has produced an updated firmware, labelled V1.60 IR 04. This firmware release moves the jar files directory in a secure area. The new firmware also includes the ability to disable the FTP server. This updated firmware can be downloaded at:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/download/WW/EN/details/681790255-TSXETG30xx-V160-IR4/?showAsIframe=true&reference=ETG30xxV160-IR04\nSchneider Electric recommends the FTP server be deactivated when not needed. The firmware update does not remove the hard-coded credentials.\nNarendra Shinde also found that configuration files were accessible using default credentials. Schneider Electric recommends users change the default login credentials. This will protect configuration files from unauthorized access.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
