TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of WebAccess/SCADA, a browser\\-based SCADA software package, are affected:* WebAccess/SCADA Versions 9\\.0\\.1 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE\\-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html) Incorrect permissions are set to default on the \u2018Project Management\u2019 page of WebAccess/SCADA portal, which may allow a low\\-privileged user to update an administrator\u2019s password and login as an administrator to escalate privileges on the system.[CVE\\-2021\\-22669](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22669)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  East Asia, Europe, United States* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Chizuru Toyama of TXOne IoT/ICS Security Research Labs of Trend Micro reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Advantech recommends users update to [Version 9\\.0\\.3](https://www.advantech.com/support/details/installation?id=1-MS9MJV)  or later. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Ensure\u00a0the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
