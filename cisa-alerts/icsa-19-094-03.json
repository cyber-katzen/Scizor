For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270 (Login required).* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
