They have been replaced by the Modicon M580 ePAC controller, Schneider Electric\u2019s most current product. Schneider Electric recommends users migrate to the Modicon M580 ePAC.\n \n\n\n\n To mitigate risks associated with this Modbus vulnerability, users should immediately set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP.\n \n\n\n\n Schneider Electric general security recommendations:\n \n\n\n* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized persons have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.\n* All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\n* All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the intended devices.\n* All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\n* Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n For more information, please see Schneider Electric advisory:\n [SEVD\\-2019\\-134\\-05](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_enDocType=Technical+leaflet&p_File_Name=SEVD-2019-134-05+-+Modicon+Controller.pdf&p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2019-134-05) \n\n\n\n\n NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n NCCIC also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page.
