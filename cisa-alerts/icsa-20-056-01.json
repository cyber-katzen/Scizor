MITIGATIONS\nMoxa has developed the following solutions to address the vulnerabilities:\n\nMB3170 Series: Download the new firmware.\nMB3270 Series: Download the new firmware.\nMB3180 Series: Download the new firmware.\n\nMoxa also recommends users follow below instructions to mitigate potential risks:\u00a0\n\nUpgrade to the latest firmware and disable HTTP and Telnet communications.\nUse Moxa utilities (MGate Manager, NPort Administration Suite Utility) to change device configurations or monitor the device status remotely.\nUse a VPN tunnel for a secure and protected connection between the devices and host PC.\n\n\n\n\nMB3280 Series: Download the new firmware.\nMB3480 Series: Download the new firmware.\nMB3660 Series: Download the new firmware.\n\nPlease see Moxa\u2019s security advisory for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
