TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following BD products are affected:\n \n\n\n* BD FACSChorus (HP Z2 G9 workstation, shipped with FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter): v5\\.0 and v5\\.1\n* BD FACSChorus (HP Z2 G5 workstation, shipped with FACSMelody Cell Sorter): v3\\.0 and v3\\.1\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [MISSING PROTECTION MECHANISM FOR ALTERNATE HARDWARE INTERFACE CWE\\-1299](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1299.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In BD FACSChorus v5\\.0, v5\\.1, v3\\.0, and v3\\.1, the respective workstation operating system does not restrict what devices can interact with its USB ports. If exploited, a threat actor with physical access to the workstation could gain access to system information and potentially exfiltrate data.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29060](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29060) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In the BD FACSChorus v5\\.0, v5\\.1, v3\\.0, and v3\\.1 workstation, there is no BIOS password. A threat actor with physical access to the workstation can potentially exploit this vulnerability to access the BIOS configuration and modify the drive boot order and BIOS pre\\-boot authentication.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29061](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29061) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In BD FACSChorus v5\\.0, v5\\.1, v3\\.0, and v3\\.1, the operating system hosting the FACSChorus application is configured to allow transmission of hashed user credentials upon user action without adequately validating the identity of the requested resource. This is possible through the use of LLMNR, MBT\\-NS, or MDNS and will result in NTLMv2 hashes being sent to a malicious entity position on the local network. These hashes can subsequently be attacked through brute force and cracked if a weak password is used. This attack would only apply to domain joined systems.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29062](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29062) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A threat actor with physical access could potentially gain credentials, which could be used to alter or destroy data stored in the database.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29065](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29065) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 4\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.7\n [INCORRECT PRIVILEGE ASSIGNMENT CWE\\-266](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/266.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In BD FACSChorus v5\\.0 and v5\\.1 and the respective workstations, the software does not properly assign data access privileges for operating system user accounts. A non\\-administrative OS account can modify information stored in the local application data folders.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29066](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29066) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 3\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Healthcare and Public Health\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n United States\n\n\n### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Michael Aguilar (v3ga) of Secureworks, Milind Sunilbhai Purswani and BD reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n \n\n\n4\\.
