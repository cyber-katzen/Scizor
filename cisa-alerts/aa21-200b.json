See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques and the D3FEND framework for referenced defensive tactics and techniques.\nThe National Security Agency, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that People\u2019s Republic of China state-sponsored malicious cyber activity is a major threat to U.S. and Allied cyberspace assets. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors aggressively target U.S. and allied political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII). Some target sectors include managed service providers, semiconductor companies, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), universities, and medical institutions. These cyber operations support China\u2019s long-term economic and military development objectives.\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. This advisory builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations about notable trends and persistent TTPs through collaborative, proactive, and retrospective analysis.\nTo increase the defensive posture of their critical networks and reduce the risk of Chinese malicious cyber activity, NSA, CISA, and FBI urge government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory and in Appendix A: Chinese State-sponsored Cyber Actors' Observed Procedures. Note: NSA, CISA, and FBI encourage organization leaders to review CISA Joint Insights: Chinese Malicious Cyber Activity: Threat Overview for Leaders for information on this threat to their organization.\nClick here\u00a0for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nTrends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations\nNSA, CISA, and FBI have observed increasingly sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored cyber activity targeting U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and CI personnel and organizations. NSA, CISA, and FBI have identified the following trends in Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber operations through proactive and retrospective analysis:\n\n\nAcquisition of Infrastructure and Capabilities. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors remain agile and cognizant of the information security community\u2019s practices. These actors take effort to mask their activities by using a revolving series of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open-source or commercial penetration tools.\n\n\nExploitation of Public Vulnerabilities. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors consistently scan target networks for critical and high vulnerabilities within days of the vulnerability\u2019s public disclosure. In many cases, these cyber actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities in major applications, such as Pulse Secure, Apache, F5 Big-IP, and Microsoft products. For information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) known to be exploited by malicious Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, see:\n\n\nCISA-FBI Joint CSA AA20-133A: Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities,\n\n\nCISA Activity Alert: AA20-275A: Potential for China Cyber Response to Heightened U.S.-China Tensions, and\n\n\nNSA CSA U/OO/179811-20: Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nEncrypted Multi-Hop Proxies. Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been routinely observed using a VPS as an encrypted proxy. The cyber actors use the VPS as well as small office and home office (SOHO) devices as operational nodes to evade detection.\n\n\nObserved Tactics and Techniques\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Framework lists the tactics and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. A downloadable JSON file is also available on the NSA Cybersecurity GitHub page.\nRefer to Appendix A: Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Actors\u2019 Observed Procedures for information on procedures affiliated with these tactics and techniques as well as applicable mitigations.\n\nFigure 1: Example of tactics and techniques used in various cyber operations.\n\u00a0\nMitigations\nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge federal and SLTT government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply the following recommendations as well as the detection and mitigation recommendations in Appendix A, which are tailored to observed tactics and techniques:\n\n\nPatch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on externally facing equipment and CVEs known to be exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. Consider implementing a patch management program that enables a timely and thorough patching cycle.\nNote: for more information on CVEs routinely exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors refer to the resources listed in the Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section.\n\nEnhance monitoring of network traffic, email, and endpoint systems. Review network signatures and indicators for focused activities, monitor for new phishing themes, and adjust email rules accordingly. Follow the best practices of restricting attachments via email and blocking URLs and domains based upon reputation. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable maximum detection capabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control (C2) activity. SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols. Implement and enhance network and endpoint event analysis and detection capabilities to identify initial infections, compromised credentials, and the manipulation of endpoint processes and files.\nUse protection capabilities to stop malicious activity. Implement anti-virus software and other endpoint protection capabilities to automatically detect and prevent malicious files from executing. Use a network intrusion detection and prevention system to identify and prevent commonly employed adversarial malware and limit nefarious data transfers. Use a domain reputation service to detect suspicious or malicious domains. Use strong credentials for service accounts and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of MFA interception techniques for some MFA implementations.\u25aa\n\nResources\nRefer to us-cert.cisa.gov/china, https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts, and https://www.nsa.gov/What-We-Do/Cybersecurity/Advisories-Technical-Guidance/ for previous reporting on Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber activity.\nDisclaimer of Endorsement\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.

These scans can be automated, through Python\u00ae scripts, to locate certain files, paths, or vulnerabilities. The cyber actors can gain valuable information on the victim network, such as the allocated resources, an organization\u2019s fully qualified domain name, IP address space, and open ports to target or exploit.\n\n\nMinimize the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties, for example:\u00a0\n\n\nScrub user email addresses and contact lists from public websites, which can be used for social engineering,\u00a0\n\n\nShare only necessary data and information with third parties, and\u00a0\n\n\nMonitor and limit third-party access to the network.\u00a0\n\n\nActive scanning from cyber actors may be identified by monitoring network traffic for sources associated with botnets, adversaries, and known bad IPs based on threat intelligence.\n\n\nDetect:\u00a0\n\n\nNetwork Traffic Analysis\n\n\nConnection Attempt Analysis [D3-CAA]\n\n\n\n\nIsolate:\u00a0\n\n\nNetwork Isolation\n\n\nInbound Traffic Filtering [D3-ITF]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather Victim Network Information [T1590]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTactics: Resource Development [TA0042]\nTable II: Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors\u2019 Resource Development TTPs with detection and mitigation recommendations\n\n\n\n\nThreat Actor\n\t\t\tTechnique / Sub-Techniques\n\n\nThreat Actor Procedure(s)\n\n\nDetection and Mitigation Recommendations\n\nDefensive Tactics and Techniques\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquire Infrastructure [T1583]\n\u00a0\n\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been observed using VPSs from cloud service providers that are physically distributed around the world to host malware and function as C2 nodes.\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdversary activities occurring outside the organization\u2019s boundary of control and view makes mitigation difficult.

Look for human generated vice machine-generated traffic, which will be more uniformly distributed.\u00a0\n\n\nLooking for the default Cobalt Strike TLS certificate.\u00a0\n\n\nLook at the user agent that generates the TLS traffic for discrepancies that may indicate faked and malicious traffic.\n\n\nReview the traffic destination domain, which may be malicious and an indicator of compromise.\n\n\nLook at the packet's HTTP host header. If it does not match with the destination domain, it may indicate a fake Cobalt Strike header and profile.\n\n\nCheck the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the flow to see if it matches one associated with Cobalt Strike's malleable C2 language. If discovered, additional recovery and investigation will be required.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nTactics: Initial Access [TA0001]\nTable III: Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors\u2019 Initial Access TTPs with detection and mitigation recommendations\n\n\n\n\nThreat Actor Technique /\n\t\t\tSub-Techniques\n\n\nThreat Actor Procedure(s)\n\n\nDetection and Mitigation Recommendations\n\n\nDetection and Mitigation Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive By Compromise [T1189]\n\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been observed gaining access to victim networks through watering hole campaigns of typo-squatted domains.\n\n\n\nEnsure all browsers and plugins are kept up to date.\nUse modern browsers with security features turned on.\nRestrict the use of unneeded websites, block unneeded downloads/attachments, block unneeded JavaScript\u00ae, restrict browser extensions, etc.\nUse adblockers to help prevent malicious code served through advertisements from executing.\u00a0\nUse script blocking extensions to help prevent the execution of unneeded JavaScript, which may be used during exploitation processes.\u00a0\nUse browser sandboxes or remote virtual environments to mitigate browser exploitation.\nUse security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation, such as Windows Defender\u00ae Exploit Guard (WDEG).\n\n\n\nDetect:\u00a0\n\nIdentifier Analysis\n\nHomoglyph Detection [D3-HD]\nURL Analysis [D3-UA]\n\n\nFile Analysis\n\nDynamic Analysis [D3-DA]\n\n\n\nIsolate:\u00a0\n\nExecution Isolation\n\nHardware-based Process Isolation [D3-HBPI]\nExecutable Allowlisting [D3-EAL]\n\n\nNetwork Isolation\n\nDNS Denylisting [D3-DNSDL]\u00a0\nOutbound Traffic Filtering [D3-OTF]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application [T1190]\n\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have exploited known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems.[1] For information on vulnerabilities known to be exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, refer to the Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section for a list of resources.\n\t\t\tChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have also been observed:\n\n\nUsing short-term VPS devices to scan and exploit vulnerable Microsoft Exchange\u00ae Outlook Web Access (OWA\u00ae) and plant webshells.\n\n\nTargeting on-premises Identity and Access Management (IdAM) and federation services in hybrid cloud environments to gain access to cloud resources.\n\n\nDeploying a public proof of concept (POC) exploit targeting a public-facing appliance vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\nReview previously published alerts and advisories from NSA, CISA, and FBI, and diligently patch vulnerable applications known to be exploited by cyber actors. Refer to the Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section for a non-inclusive list of resources.\nAdditional mitigations include:\n\nConsider implementing Web Application Firewalls (WAF), which can prevent exploit traffic from reaching an application.\nSegment externally facing servers and services from the rest of the network with a demilitarized zone (DMZ).\nUse multi-factor authentication (MFA) with strong factors and require regular re-authentication.\nDisable protocols using weak authentication.\nLimit access to and between cloud resources with the desired state being a Zero Trust model. For more information refer to NSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: [Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model].\nWhen possible, use cloud-based access controls on cloud resources (e.g., cloud service provider (CSP)-managed authentication between virtual machines).\nUse automated tools to audit access logs for security concerns.\nWhere possible, enforce MFA for password resets.\nDo not include Application Programing Interface (API) keys in software version control systems where they can be unintentionally leaked.\n\n\n\nHarden:\n\nApplication Hardening [D3-AH]\nPlatform Hardening\n\nSoftware Update [D3-SU]\n\n\n\nDetect:\n\nFile Analysis [D3-FA]\u00a0\nNetwork Traffic Analysis\n\nClient-server Payload Profiling [D3-CSPP]\n\n\nProcess Analysis\u00a0\n\nProcess Spawn Analysis\nProcess Lineage Analysis [D3-PLA]\n\n\n\nIsolate:\u00a0\n\nNetwork Isolation\n\nInbound Traffic Filtering [D3-ITF]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhishing [T1566]:\u00a0\n\n\nSpearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]\u00a0\n\n\nSpearphishing Link [T1566.002]\n\n\n\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been observed conducting spearphishing campaigns. These email compromise attempts range from generic emails with mass targeted phishing attempts to specifically crafted emails in targeted social engineering lures.\u00a0\n\t\t\tThese compromise attempts use the cyber actors\u2019 dynamic collection of VPSs, previously compromised accounts, or other infrastructure in order to encourage engagement from the target audience through domain typo-squatting and masquerading. These emails may contain a malicious link or files that will provide the cyber actor access to the victim\u2019s device after the user clicks on the malicious link or opens the attachment.\u00a0\n\n\n\nImplement a user training program and simulated spearphishing emails to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments and re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails. Quarantine suspicious files with antivirus solutions.\nUse a network intrusion prevention system (IPS) to scan and remove malicious email attachments.\nBlock uncommon file types in emails that are not needed by general users (.exe, .jar,.vbs)\nUse anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using Sender Policy Framework [SPF]) and integrity of messages (using Domain Keys Identified Mail [DKIM]). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance [DMARC]) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.\nDetermine if certain websites that can be used for spearphishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk.\nPrevent users from clicking on malicious links by stripping hyperlinks or implementing \"URL defanging\" at the Email Security Gateway or other email security tools.\nAdd external sender banners to emails to alert users that the email came from an external sender.\n\n\n\nHarden:\u00a0\n\nMessage Hardening\n\nMessage Authentication [D3-MAN]\nTransfer Agent Authentication [D3-TAAN]\n\n\n\nDetect:\u00a0\n\nFile Analysis\n\nDynamic Analysis [D3-DA]\n\n\nIdentifier Analysis\n\nHomoglyph Detection [D3-HD]\nURL Analysis [D3-UA]\n\n\nMessage Analysis\n\nSender MTA Reputation Analysis [D3-SMRA]\nSender Reputation Analysis [D3-SRA]\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Remote Services [T1133]\n\n\nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors have been observed:\n\n\nExploiting vulnerable devices immediately after conducting scans for critical zero-day or publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
