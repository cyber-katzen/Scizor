See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/enterprise/) \n for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques and the\n [D3FEND framework](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) \n for referenced defensive tactics and techniques.* \n\n\n\n\n The National Security Agency, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that People\u2019s Republic of China state\\-sponsored malicious cyber activity is a major threat to U.S. and Allied cyberspace assets. Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors aggressively target U.S. and allied political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure (CI) personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, critical and emerging key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information (PII). Some target sectors include managed service providers, semiconductor companies, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), universities, and medical institutions. These cyber operations support China\u2019s long\\-term economic and military development objectives.\n \n\n\n\n This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors. This advisory builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations about notable trends and persistent TTPs through collaborative, proactive, and retrospective analysis.\n \n\n\n\n To increase the defensive posture of their critical networks and reduce the risk of Chinese malicious cyber activity, NSA, CISA, and FBI urge government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory and in Appendix A: Chinese State\\-sponsored Cyber Actors' Observed Procedures.\n **Note:** \n NSA, CISA, and FBI encourage organization leaders to review\n [CISA Joint Insights: Chinese Malicious Cyber Activity: Threat Overview for Leaders](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/chinese-cyber-threat-overview-and-actions-leaders) \n for information on this threat to their organization.\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/19/2002805003/-1/-1/1/CSA_CHINESE_STATE-SPONSORED_CYBER_TTPS.PDF) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n#### **Trends in Chinese State\\-Sponsored Cyber Operations**\n\n\n\n NSA, CISA, and FBI have observed increasingly sophisticated Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber activity targeting U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and CI personnel and organizations. NSA, CISA, and FBI have identified the following trends in Chinese state\\-sponsored malicious cyber operations through proactive and retrospective analysis:\n \n\n\n* **Acquisition of Infrastructure and Capabilities** \n . Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors remain agile and cognizant of the information security community\u2019s practices. These actors take effort to mask their activities by using a revolving series of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open\\-source or commercial penetration tools.\n* **Exploitation of Public Vulnerabilities.** \n Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors consistently scan target networks for critical and high vulnerabilities within days of the vulnerability\u2019s public disclosure. In many cases, these cyber actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities in major applications, such as Pulse Secure, Apache, F5 Big\\-IP, and Microsoft products. For information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) known to be exploited by malicious Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors, see:\n \n\n\n\t+ CISA\\-FBI Joint CSA AA20\\-133A:\n\t [Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a) \n\t ,\n\t+ CISA Activity Alert: AA20\\-275A:\n\t [Potential for China Cyber Response to Heightened U.S.\\-China Tensions](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-275a) \n\t , and\n\t+ NSA CSA U/OO/179811\\-20:\n\t [Chinese State\\-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF) \n\t .\n* **Encrypted Multi\\-Hop Proxies.** \n Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors have been routinely observed using a VPS as an encrypted proxy. The cyber actors use the VPS as well as small office and home office (SOHO) devices as operational nodes to evade detection.\n\n\n#### **Observed Tactics and Techniques**\n\n\n\n Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to exploit computer networks of interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Appendix B: MITRE ATT\\&CK Framework lists the tactics and techniques used by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors. A downloadable\n [JSON file](https://github.com/nsacyber/chinese-state-sponsored-cyber-operations-observed-ttps) \n is also available on the\n [NSA Cybersecurity GitHub page](https://github.com/nsacyber) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Refer to Appendix A: Chinese State\\-Sponsored Cyber Actors\u2019 Observed Procedures for information on procedures affiliated with these tactics and techniques as well as applicable mitigations.\n \n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 1: Example of tactics and techniques used in various cyber operations.* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\n\n NSA, CISA, and FBI urge federal and SLTT government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations to apply the following recommendations as well as the detection and mitigation recommendations in Appendix A, which are tailored to observed tactics and techniques:\n \n\n\n* **Patch systems and equipment promptly and diligently.** \n Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial\\-of\\-service on externally facing equipment and CVEs known to be exploited by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors. Consider implementing a patch management program that enables a timely and thorough patching cycle.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Note:** \n for more information on CVEs routinely exploited by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors refer to the resources listed in the Trends in Chinese State\\-Sponsored Cyber Operations section.\n* **Enhance monitoring of network traffic, email, and endpoint systems.** \n Review network signatures and indicators for focused activities, monitor for new phishing themes, and adjust email rules accordingly. Follow the best practices of restricting attachments via email and blocking URLs and domains based upon reputation. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable maximum detection capabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control (C2\\) activity. SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network\\-based indicators of malware communication protocols. Implement and enhance network and endpoint event analysis and detection capabilities to identify initial infections, compromised credentials, and the manipulation of endpoint processes and files.\n* **Use protection capabilities to stop malicious activity.** \n Implement anti\\-virus software and other endpoint protection capabilities to automatically detect and prevent malicious files from executing. Use a network intrusion detection and prevention system to identify and prevent commonly employed adversarial malware and limit nefarious data transfers. Use a domain reputation service to detect suspicious or malicious domains. Use strong credentials for service accounts and multi\\-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of MFA interception techniques for some MFA implementations.\u25aa\n\n\n### Resources\n\n\n\n Refer to\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov/china](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/china) \n ,\n [https://www.ic3\\.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts) \n , and\n [https://www.nsa.gov/What\\-We\\-Do/Cybersecurity/Advisories\\-Technical\\-Guidance/](https://www.nsa.gov/What-We-Do/Cybersecurity/Advisories-Technical-Guidance/) \n for previous reporting on Chinese state\\-sponsored malicious cyber activity.\n \n\n\n### Disclaimer of Endorsement\n\n\n\n The information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.
