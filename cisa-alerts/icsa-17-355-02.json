It can be downloaded from the following location:\nhttps://www.pelco.com/search?documentUUID=478b93c1-d908-4438-867f-7bcf849b28a8&title=VideoXpert Core Software v2.1\u00a0\nMore information on the new firmware and the issues it was created to address can be found in Schneider Electric Security Notification SEVD-2017-339-01 at the following location:\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-339-01/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\n\nBy sniffing communications, an unauthorized person can execute a directory traversal attack resulting in authentication bypass or session hijack.\nCVE-2017-9964 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N).\n\nIMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\n\nUsing a directory traversal attack, an unauthorized person can view web server files.\nCVE-2017-9965 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n\nIMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\n\nBy replacing certain files, an authorized user can obtain system privileges and the inserted code would execute at an elevated privilege level.\nCVE-2017-9966 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nGjoko Krstic reported these vulnerabilities to Schneider Electric.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector: Commercial facilities\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: France\n",
