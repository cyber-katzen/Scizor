A user must be logged in to the web interface. Siemens recommends that users use the integrated web server on Port 80/TCP only in trusted networks.[CVE\\-2017\\-12734](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12734)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [CHANNEL ACCESSIBLE BY NON\\-ENDPOINT (MAN\\-IN\\-THE\\-MIDDLE) CWE\\-300](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html) An attacker who performs a man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack between the LOGO! and other devices could potentially decrypt and modify network traffic.[CVE\\-2017\\-12735](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12735)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Transportation Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Maxim Rupp discovered one of these two vulnerabilities.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens provides LOGO!8 BM FS\\-05 with firmware Version 1\\.81\\.2, which fixes the first Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens recommends users [update to v8\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109783346/)  to mitigate the Man\\-in\\-the\\-Middle vulnerability.**NOTE**  : To update, a new hardware version is required. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Configure the environment according to the recommendations in the [Siemens user manual](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109741041)  .* Apply cell protection concept.* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.* Apply [defense\\-in\\-depth](https://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/Pages/default.aspx)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End\u00a0Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  to run the devices in a protected IT environment. For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-087240](http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  .
