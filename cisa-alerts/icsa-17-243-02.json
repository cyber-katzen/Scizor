EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: LOGO!\nVulnerabilities: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, Man-in-the-Middle\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-17-243-02 Siemens LOGO! that was published August 31, 2017, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to hijack existing web sessions.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the vulnerabilities affect the following LOGO! devices:\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nLOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to v1.81.2\nLOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to v8.3\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nAn attacker with network access to the integrated web server on Port 80/TCP could obtain the session ID of an active user session. A user must be logged in to the web interface. Siemens recommends that users use the integrated web server on Port 80/TCP only in trusted networks.\u00a0\nCVE-2017-12734 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CHANNEL ACCESSIBLE BY NON-ENDPOINT (MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE) CWE-300\nAn attacker who performs a man-in-the-middle attack between the LOGO! and other devices could potentially decrypt and modify network traffic.\u00a0\nCVE-2017-12735 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMaxim Rupp discovered one of these two vulnerabilities.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens provides LOGO!8 BM FS-05 with firmware Version 1.81.2, which fixes the first Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens recommends users update to v8.3 to mitigate the Man-in-the-Middle vulnerability.\u00a0\nNOTE: To update, a new hardware version is required.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nConfigure the environment according to the recommendations in the Siemens user manual.\nApply cell protection concept.\nUse VPN for protecting network communication between cells.\nApply defense-in-depth.\n\n--------- End\u00a0Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-087240\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
