If assistance is needed in identifying a local Siemens service organization, users may contact a local Siemens hotline at the following link:\nhttps://w3.siemens.com/aspa_app/\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends users configure their environment according to Siemens operational guidelines found below:\nhttps://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/Documents/operational_guidelines_industrial_security_en.pdf\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-934525 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE CWE-300\n\nA channel accessible by non-endpoint (\u2018man-in-the-middle\u2019) vulnerability has been identified. This could allow an unverified attacker to eavesdrop, capture, or modify communications.\nCVE-2017-2685 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector(s): Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, and Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Germany\n",
