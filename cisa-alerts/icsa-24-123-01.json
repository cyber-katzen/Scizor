EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/Low attack complexity\nVendor: CyberPower\nEquipment: PowerPanel business\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Password, Relative Path Traversal, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Active Debug Code, Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'), Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Improper Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker bypassing authentication and gaining administrator privileges, forging JWT tokens to bypass authentication, writing arbitrary files to the server and achieving code execution, gaining access to services with the privileges of a PowerPanel business application, gaining access to the testing or production server, learning passwords and authenticating with user or administrator privileges, injecting SQL syntax, writing arbitrary files to the system, executing remote code, impersonating any client in the system and sending malicious data, or obtaining data from throughout the system after gaining access to any device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PowerPanel business, a business management software, are affected:\n\nPowerPanel business: 4.9.0 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nThe application code contains a hard-coded set of authentication credentials. This could result in an attacker bypassing authentication and gaining administrator privileges.\nCVE-2024-34025 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nThe application code contains a hard-coded JWT signing key. This could result in an attacker forging JWT tokens to bypass authentication.\nCVE-2024-33625 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3 RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nA specially crafted Zip file containing path traversal characters can be imported to the server, which allows file writing to the server outside the intended scope, and could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution.\nCVE-2024-33615 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4 USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nHard-coded credentials are used by the platform to authenticate to the database, other services, and the cloud. This could result in an attacker gaining access to services with the privileges of a Powerpanel business application.\nCVE-2024-32053 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5 ACTIVE DEBUG CODE CWE-489\nHard-coded credentials for the test server can be found in the production code. This might result in an attacker gaining access to the testing or production server.\nCVE-2024-32047 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6 STORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE-257\nThe key used to encrypt passwords stored in the database can be found in the application code, allowing the passwords to be recovered.\nCVE-2024-32042 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nAn attacker with certain MQTT permissions can create malicious messages to all Power Panel devices. This could result in an attacker injecting SQL syntax, writing arbitrary files to the system, and executing remote code.\nCVE-2024-31856 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8 USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nThe devices Power Panel manages use identical certificates based on a hard-coded cryptographic key. This can allow an attacker to impersonate any client in the system and send malicious data.\nCVE-2024-31410 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.9 IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nCertain MQTT wildcards are not blocked on the system, which might result in an attacker obtaining data from throughout the system after gaining access to any device.\nCVE-2024-31409 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAmir Preminger and Noam Moshe of Claroty Team82 Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCyberPower has released a new version of PowerPanel business that fixes these vulnerabilities:\nPowerPanel business: Update to v4.10.1 or later version\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
