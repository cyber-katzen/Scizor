An attacker with restricted privileges could corrupt the content used to generate XLS reports to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher\\-privileged users and obtain remote code execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.[CVE\\-2022\\-24039](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/75.html)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) The web application fails to enforce an upper bound to the cost factor of the PBKDF2 derived key during the creation or update of an account. An attacker with the user profile access privilege could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition through CPU consumption by setting a PBKDF2 derived key with a high\\-cost effort, followed by a login attempt to the modified account.[CVE\\-2022\\-24040](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24040)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.3 [USE OF PASSWORD HASH WITH INSUFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT CWE\\-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html) The web application stores the PBKDF2 derived key of user\u2019s passwords with a low iteration count. An attacker with user profile access privilege can retrieve the stored password hashes of other accounts and then successfully perform an offline cracking attack and recover the plaintext passwords of other users.[CVE\\-2022\\-24041](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24041)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

An attacker could capture this token and re\\-use old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.[CVE\\-2022\\-24042](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24042)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.5 [OBSERVABLE DISCREPANCY CWE\\-203](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html) The login functionality of the application fails to normalize the response times of login attempts performed with wrong usernames with the ones executed with correct usernames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this side\\-channel information to perform a username enumeration attack and identify valid usernames.[CVE\\-2022\\-24043](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24043)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.6 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE\\-307](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html) The login functionality of the application does not employ countermeasures against password spraying attacks or credential stuffing attacks. An attacker could obtain a list of valid usernames on the device and use that list to perform a precise password spraying or credential stuffing attack to obtain access to at least one account.[CVE\\-2022\\-24044](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24044)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.7 [SENSITIVE COOKIE IN HTTPS SESSION WITHOUT \u2018SECURE\u2019 ATTRIBUTE CWE\\-614](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html) Following a successful login, the application sets the session cookie on the browser via client\\-side JavaScript code without applying security attributes (such as \u201cSecure\u201d \u201cHttpOnly\u201d or \u201cSameSite\u201d). Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then sniff the network and capture sensitive information.[CVE\\-2022\\-24045](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24045)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-626968](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-626968.pdf)  For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-662649](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-662649.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
