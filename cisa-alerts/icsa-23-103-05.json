This could allow an unauthorized attacker in a machine-in-the-middle position to read and modify any data passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29054\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:\u00a0\n\nUpdate all affected products to\u00a0V5.5.2 or later.\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk identified in the vulnerability overview: \u00a0\n\nConfigure the SSH clients to use strong key exchange ciphers.\u00a0\nAdd only trusted SSH client public keys to the responding operating system (ROS) and allow access to those clients only.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\u00a0\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-479249 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
