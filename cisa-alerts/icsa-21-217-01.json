MITIGATIONS--------------- HCC recommends users apply release v4\\.3 or later to mitigate these vulnerabilities. For more information, [contact HCC](mailto:security@hcc-embedded.com)  . Additional vendors affected by the reported vulnerabilities have also released security advisories related to their affected products. Those advisories are as follows:* [Siemens](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-789208.pdf)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * [Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC Series Remote I/O](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-022_en.pdf)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
