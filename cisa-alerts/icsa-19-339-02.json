MITIGATIONS\nCERT@VDE and Weidmueller report the following mitigations:\nSolutions for CVE-2019-16672\nSolution for vulnerabilities, valid for switch series IE-SW-VL05M and IE-SW-VL08MT\n\nTo avoid the vulnerabilities referred to in this section, it is necessary to install patched firmware. After installation of patched firmware, the web interface can be accessed via encrypted communication using https, and web interface access can be configured to ensure encrypted connections by selecting \u201chttps only.\u201d\nThe respective web interface menu section for this setting can be reached via the following path: Main Menu > Basic Settings > System: Set the \u201cWeb Configuration\u201d to \u201chttps only.\u201d\n\nSolution for vulnerabilities valid for switch series IE-SW-PL08M, IE-SW-PL10M, IE-SW-PL16M, IE-SW-PL18M, and IE-SW-PL09M\n\nTo avoid the vulnerabilities referred to in this section, installation of patched firmware is not necessary. Web interface access can be configured to ensure encrypted connections by selecting \u201chttps only.\u201d\nThe respective web interface menu section for this setting can be reached via the following path: Main Menu > Basic Settings > System: Set the \u201cWeb Configuration\u201d to \u201chttps only.\u201d\n\nSolution for CVE-2019-16670, CVE-2019-16671, CVE-2019-16673, and CVE-2019-16674\nValid for switch series IE-SW-VL05M, IE-SW-VL08MT, IE-SW-PL08M, IE-SW-PL10M, IE-SW-PL16M, IE-SW-PL18M, and IE-SW-PL09M\n\nAfter installing the patched firmware on the switch, it is possible to disable the unencrypted search service via Weidmueller configuration software named \u201cWM Switch Utility\u201d for Windows OS and to enable an encrypted search service, which will be working with the new \u201cWeidmueller Switch Configuration Utility\u201d (available soon).\nBoth services\u2014the encrypted and the unencrypted search service\u2014are enabled by default. To avoid the vulnerabilities referred to in this section, the unencrypted search service should be disabled.\nThe respective web interface menu section for this setting can be reached via the following path: Main Menu > Basic Settings > Security > Management Interface: Uncheck the checkbox \u201cEnable Search Service.\u201d\n\nNote: After disabling the unencrypted search service, the switches can no longer be found or configured with the current \u201cWM Switch Utility.\u201d\nWeb interface settings are not affected by this configuration.\nBelow are the patched versions available for the respective industrial ethernet switch model:\n\nIE-SW-VL05M-5TX firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL05MT-5TX firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL05M-3TX-2SC firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL05MT-3TX-2SC firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL05M-3TX-2ST firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL05MT-3TX-2ST firmware v3.6.24 Build 19062809 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-8TX firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-5TX-3SC firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-5TX-1SC-2SCS firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-6TX-2ST firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-6TX-2SC firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-VL08MT-6TX-2SCS firmware v3.5.22 Build 19062810 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08M-8TX firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08MT-8TX firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08M-6TX-2SC firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08MT-6TX-2SC firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08M-6TX-2ST firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811and prior\nIE-SW-PL08MT-6TX-2ST firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08M-6TX-2SCS firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL08MT-6TX-2SCS firmware v3.3.16 Build 19062811 and prior\nIE-SW-PL10M-3GT-7TX firmware v3.3.24 Build 19062813 and prior\nIE-SW-PL10MT-3GT-7TX firmware v3.3.24 Build 19062813 and prior\nIE-SW-PL10M-1GT-2GS-7TX firmware v3.3.24 Build 19062813 and prior\nIE-SW-PL10MT-1GT-2GS-7TX firmware v3.3.24 Build 19062813 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16M-16TX firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16MT-16TX firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16M-14TX-2SC firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16MT-14TX-2SC firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16M-14TX-2ST firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL16MT-14TX-2ST firmware v3.4.18 Build 19062814 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18M-2GC-16TX firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18MT-2GC-16TX firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18M-2GC14TX2SC firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18MT-2GC14TX2SC firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18M-2GC14TX2ST firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18MT-2GC14TX2ST firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18M-2GC14TX2SCS firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL18MT-2GC14TX2SCS firmware v3.4.30 Build 19062817 and prior\nIE-SW-PL09M-5GC-4GT firmware v3.3.20 Build 19070111 and prior\nIE-SW-PL09MT-5GC-4GT firmware v3.3.20 Build 19070111 and prior\n\nFor more information see the CERT@VDE advisory located at: https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2019-018 or contact Weidmueller at www.weidmueller.com/service.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
