EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.7\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity/exploitable remotely\nVendor: Johnson Controls, Inc.\nEquipment: Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers\nVulnerabilities: Unverified Password Change, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized users to compromise passwords and inject malicious code into web interfaces.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers are affected:\n\nAll Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Versions 10 and 11\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNVERIFIED PASSWORD CHANGE CWE-620\nThe affected products allow passwords to be guessed at a high rate.\nCVE-2022-21935 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 \u00a0 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIt is possible to inject and store malicious code into the web interfaces of the affected products.\nCVE-2022-21937 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIt is possible to inject and store malicious code into the Draft Graphics (MUI Graphics) web interfaces of the affected products.\nCVE-2022-21938 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc., reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users take the following actions:\n\nUpdate Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Version 10 with patch 10.1.5\nUpdate Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Versions 11 with patch 11.0.2\n\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2022-10 v1\nJohnson Controls also recommends following CISA guidelines for minimizing the risks associated with automation systems, detailed below.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
