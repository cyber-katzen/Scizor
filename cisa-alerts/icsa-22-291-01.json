EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Advantech* **Equipment:**  R\\-SeeNet* **Vulnerabilities:**  Path Traversal, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an unauthorized attacker remotely deleting files on the system or allowing remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of R\\-SeeNet, a software management platform, are affected:* Version 2\\.4\\.19 and prior* Version 2\\.4\\.17 and prior (CVE\\-2022\\-3386 and CVE\\-2022\\-3385 only)### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 **[IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)** Advantech R\\-SeeNet Versions 2\\.4\\.19 and prior are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An unauthorized attacker could remotely exploit vulnerable PHP code to delete .PDF files.[CVE\\-2022\\-3387](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3387)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 **[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** Advantech R\\-SeeNet Versions 2\\.4\\.17 and prior are vulnerable to a stack\\-based buffer overflow. An unauthorized attacker can use an outsized filename to overflow the stack buffer and enable remote code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-3386](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3386)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 **[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** Advantech R\\-SeeNet Versions 2\\.4\\.17 and prior are vulnerable to a stack\\-based buffer overflow. An unauthorized attacker can remotely overflow the stack buffer and enable remote code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-3385](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3385)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER rgod, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Advantech recommends users update R\\-SeeNet to Version 2\\.4\\.21 or later. Advantech also recommends users follow CISA\u2019s cybersecurity recommendations. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
