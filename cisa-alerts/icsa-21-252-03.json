EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V.\nEquipment: smartRTU and INEA ME-RTU\nVulnerabilities: OS Command Injection, Improper Access Control, Cross-site Scripting, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Unprotected Storage of Credentials, Incorrect Default Permissions\n\n2. REPOSTED INFORMATION\nThis advisory is a follow-up to a CISA product update titled ICS-ALERT-19-225-01 Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. smartRTU and INEA ME-RTU (Update A) published September 10, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain remote code execution, obtain credentials, and use credentials found to log into other affected devices.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products are affected:\n\nsmartRTU and INEA ME-RTU: All firmware versions prior to Version 3.3\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nThe affected product allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands due to the passing of unsafe user supplied data to the system shell.\nCVE-2019-14931 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nIt is possible to download the affected product\u2019s configuration file, which contains sensitive data, through the URL.\nCVE-2019-14927 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product\u2019s web configuration software allows an authenticated user to inject malicious data into the application that can then be executed in a victim\u2019s browser, allowing stored cross-site scripting.\nCVE-2019-14928 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nHard-coded SSH keys have been identified in the affected product\u2019s firmware. As the secure keys cannot be regenerated by a user and are not regenerated on firmware updates, all deployed affected products utilize the same SSH keys.\nCVE-2019-14926 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected products contain undocumented user accounts with hard-coded password credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the accounts to login to affected RTU\u2019s.\nCVE-2019-14930 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNPROTECTED STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS CWE-256\nThe affected products store password credentials in plain text in a configuration file. An unauthenticated user can obtain the exposed password credentials to gain access to the specific services.\nCVE-2019-14929 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nThe affected products store and reads configuration settings from a file that has insecure world-readable permissions assigned. This could allow all users on the system to read the configuration file containing usernames and plain text password combinations, as well as other sensitive configuration information of the RTU.\nCVE-2019-14925 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMark Cross (@xerubus) reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. recommends users update to firmware Version 3.3 or later.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nKnown public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
