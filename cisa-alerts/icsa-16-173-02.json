Schneider Electric has produced a firmware update to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of PowerLogic PM8ECC:\n\nPowerLogic PM8ECC, firmware versions prior to Version 2.651\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in a specially crafted URL request where the response containing user data is returned to the web browser without being made safe to display.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and it maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, PowerLogic PM8ECC, is a communications add-on module for the Series 800 PowerMeter. According to Schneider Electric, PowerLogic PM8ECC is deployed in the Commercial Facilities sector. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, web site last accessed June 21, 2016.\n\nThis vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.\nCVE-2016-4513NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4513, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, web site last accessed June 21, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSchneider Electric has produced a firmware update to mitigate this vulnerability. The PowerLogic PM8ECC firmware Version 2.651 is available at:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/p8e02651_DOT_bin\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
