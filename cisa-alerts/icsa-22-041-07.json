An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38405 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nOpen Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11 used in affected products contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing a DXF file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-43336 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll contains an out-of-bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-44000 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library is vulnerable to memory corruption condition while parsing specially crafted PAR files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-44016 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library is vulnerable to memory corruption condition while parsing specially crafted PAR files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-44018 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens and CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for some of the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not yet available.\n\nJT2Go: Update to v13.2.0.7 or later version\nSolid Edge SE2021: Update to SE2021MP9 or later version\nSolid Edge SE2022: Update to SE2022MP1 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization v12.4: Update to v12.4.0.13 or later version\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nTeamcenter Visualization v13.1: Update to v13.1.0.9 or later version\n\n--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nTeamcenter Visualization v13.2: Update to v13.2.0.7 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization v13.3: Update to v13.3.0.1 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nAvoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in affected products.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nPlease see Siemens security advisory SSA-301589 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation o these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
