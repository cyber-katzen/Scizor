MITIGATIONS--------------- Emerson is issuing a notice to its customer base with mitigation recommendations, encouraging users with this older software to upgrade to a more current version supported by Emerson and the third\\-party vendor. For users with installations of the affected versions, Emerson recommends following the instructions outlined in Step 1 and Step 2 (below) to determine whether communication services (including FTP) have been enabled. If communication services have been enabled, Emerson recommends users return FTP services to their default (disabled) state as soon as is practical. If users are unable to make controller changes or disable communication services per the instructions below, they are strongly encouraged to restrict FTP communications to the required database and controller drops only.**Review Ovation Software and Hardware** **Step 1 \u2013 Check the Ovation Controller Type**  In Ovation Developer Studio, right\\-click on each controller object, select \u201cOpen\u201d and review the \u201cController Type\u201d listed. Alternately, run a System Registration report and verify the \u201cModel\u201d for each controller.* OCR400: The controller is potentially affected; continue with Step 2 (below)* OCR161: The controller is not affected by the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory, and can be disregarded**Step 2 \u2013 Check the Ovation Software Version** *Ovation v3\\.0\\.4 and older*  FTP services cannot be disabled using the Communications Services configuration detailed below. Emerson recommends users of retired systems, including Ovation v3\\.3\\.1 and older, consider upgrading to a more current version in which these issues do not exist. However, separate mitigation involving network configuration may still be possible. Please refer to the \u201cReview Ovation Highway Switch Configuration\u201d section (below).*Ovation v3\\.1\\.0 \u2013 v3\\.3\\.1*  Follow the \u201cDetermine Current State of Communications Services\u201d (below).*Ovation v3\\.5\\.0 and Newer*  FTP communications services cannot be enabled. This advisory does not apply to those versions.**Determine Current State of Communication Services**  Two methods exist for checking the current state of controller communication services: 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ovation Developer Studio 2\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Controller Diagnostics application*Method 1 \u2013 Use Ovation Developer Studio to determine the state and modify as needed*  The steps necessary to review and/or modify communications services settings can be found in Section 5\\.10\\.1 of the Developer Studio User Guide for Ovation 3\\.3\\.1 (PWS\\_005981\\), which is available on the Ovation Users\u2019 Group website: [www.ovationusers.com](http://www.ovationusers.com)  (this website requires registration).*Method 2 \u2013 Use Controller Diagnostics to determine the state and modify as needed*  1\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open the Controller Diagnostic application on an Ovation HMI. 2\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Select a drop pair by double\\-clicking on it in the lower\\-left tree. 3\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In the upper\\-left menu, verify the \u201cComm Services\u201d section is set to \u201cDisabled\u201d for both the primary and secondary controllers. 4\\.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If \u201cEnabled,\u201d left\\-click on the object to activate the drop\\-down menu and select \u201cDisabled.\u201d**Review Ovation Highway Switch Configurations**  Systems using Cisco 2960 and/or 3750 switches on the Ovation Highway may be able to limit FTP communications (as well as telnet, rlogin, and SSH) using access control lists (ACLs).
