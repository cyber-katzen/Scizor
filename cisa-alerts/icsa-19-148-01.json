EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Emerson\nEquipment: Ovation OCR400 Controller\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow privilege escalation or remote code execution, or it may halt the controller.\nFor clarification, the referenced hardware is running a software version the vendor retired in July 2015. The identified vulnerabilities exist in a third-party embedded software version discontinued by that vendor.\nIn addition, the vulnerable services are disabled by default in all product releases since 2007.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Emerson Ovation Controller OCR400, a process control device, are affected:\n\nEmerson Ovation OCR400 Controller running Ovation Version 3.3.1 or earlier\n\nThese discontinued product versions include an embedded third-party FTP server, which is the vulnerable component. The vulnerable version of the FTP server was discontinued by that vendor several years ago.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nA stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified in the embedded third-party FTP server. The vulnerability involves improper handling of a long file name from the LIST command to the FTP service, which may cause the service to overwrite buffers, leading to remote code execution and escalation of privileges.\nCVE-2019-10967 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified in the embedded third-party FTP server. The vulnerability involves improper handling of a long command to the FTP service, which may cause memory corruption that halts the controller or leads to remote code execution and escalation of privileges.\nCVE-2019-10965 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Electrical (Power Generation), Water and Wastewater\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVDLab, a collaboration of Venustech and Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC), reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEmerson is issuing a notice to its customer base with mitigation recommendations, encouraging users with this older software to upgrade to a more current version supported by Emerson and the third-party vendor.\nFor users with installations of the affected versions, Emerson recommends following the instructions outlined in Step 1 and Step 2 (below) to determine whether communication services (including FTP) have been enabled. If communication services have been enabled, Emerson recommends users return FTP services to their default (disabled) state as soon as is practical. If users are unable to make controller changes or disable communication services per the instructions below, they are strongly encouraged to restrict FTP communications to the required database and controller drops only.\u2003Review Ovation Software and Hardware\nStep 1 \u2013 Check the Ovation Controller Type\nIn Ovation Developer Studio, right-click on each controller object, select \u201cOpen\u201d and review the \u201cController Type\u201d listed. Alternately, run a System Registration report and verify the \u201cModel\u201d for each controller.\n\nOCR400: The controller is potentially affected; continue with Step 2 (below)\nOCR161: The controller is not affected by the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory, and can be disregarded\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Check the Ovation Software Version\nOvation v3.0.4 and older\nFTP services cannot be disabled using the Communications Services configuration detailed below. Emerson recommends users of retired systems, including Ovation v3.3.1 and older, consider upgrading to a more current version in which these issues do not exist.\nHowever, separate mitigation involving network configuration may still be possible. Please refer to the \u201cReview Ovation Highway Switch Configuration\u201d section (below).\nOvation v3.1.0 \u2013 v3.3.1\nFollow the \u201cDetermine Current State of Communications Services\u201d (below).\nOvation v3.5.0 and Newer\nFTP communications services cannot be enabled. This advisory does not apply to those versions.\nDetermine Current State of Communication Services\nTwo methods exist for checking the current state of controller communication services:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ovation Developer Studio\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Controller Diagnostics application\nMethod 1 \u2013 Use Ovation Developer Studio to determine the state and modify as needed\nThe steps necessary to review and/or modify communications services settings can be found in Section 5.10.1 of the Developer Studio User Guide for Ovation 3.3.1 (PWS_005981), which is available on the Ovation Users\u2019 Group website: www.ovationusers.com (this website requires registration).\nMethod 2 \u2013 Use Controller Diagnostics to determine the state and modify as needed\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open the Controller Diagnostic application on an Ovation HMI.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Select a drop pair by double-clicking on it in the lower-left tree.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In the upper-left menu, verify the \u201cComm Services\u201d section is set to \u201cDisabled\u201d for both the primary and secondary controllers.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If \u201cEnabled,\u201d left-click on the object to activate the drop-down menu and select \u201cDisabled.\u201d\u2003Review Ovation Highway Switch Configurations\nSystems using Cisco 2960 and/or 3750 switches on the Ovation Highway may be able to limit FTP communications (as well as telnet, rlogin, and SSH) using access control lists (ACLs). Please refer to the whitepaper \u201cEnabling TELNET, SSH, RLOGIN & FTP Blocking on Ovation Switches,\u201d which is available at www.ovationusers.com (Support and Security | Security | Network Whitepapers).\nOvation Contact Information\nOvation users with questions or concerns regarding the impact of these vulnerabilities on Ovation should contact the Ovation-CERT via email at OvationCERT@emerson.com or by phone at 1-800-445-9723, Option 3.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
