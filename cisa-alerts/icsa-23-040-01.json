EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Control By Web\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0X-400, X-600M\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Cross-Site Scripting, Code Injection\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript and execute arbitrary code remotely, which could result in a loss of sensitive information.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Control By Web X-400 and X-600M, web enabled I/O Controllers, are affected:\u00a0\n\nX-400: All firmware versions prior to 2.8\u00a0\nX-600M: All firmware versions prior to 1.16.00\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\u00a0\nControl By Web X-400 devices are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack, which could result in private and session information being transferred to the attacker.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23553\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\u00a0\nControl By Web X-600M devices run Lua scripts and are vulnerable to code injection, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23551\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nFloris Hendriks and Jeroen Wijenbergh of Radboud University reported these vulnerabilities to Control By Web.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nControl By Web has provided a fix and recommends applying the updates for the following products:\u00a0\n\nX-400: Update to firmware\u00a0v2.8\u00a0or later\u00a0\nX-600M: Update firmware to\u00a0v1.16.00\u00a0or later\u00a0\n\nFor assistance, contact\u00a0technical support\u00a0for questions or to obtain the correct firmware version for a specific unit.\u00a0\nControl By Web recommends the following to reduce the risk of exploitation:\u00a0\n\nUse a secure administrator password. \u00a0\nDo not use the default password.\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
