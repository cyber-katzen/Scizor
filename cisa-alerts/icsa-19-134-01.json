A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER The researcher with the handle n0b0dy sent information to CISA, leading to the discovery of this vulnerability.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Omron has released Version 3\\.42 of Network Configurator for DeviceNet Safety to address the reported vulnerability. Users can download the [latest version of Network Configurator for DeviceNet Safety](https://www.fa.omron.co.jp/product/tool/32/safetycf/cfsc1_download_en.html)  . Omron has recommended applying the following for further mitigation:* Remove or restrict directories listed in the PATH environment variable.* Ensure system directories are writable only by administrators, which is Windows\u2019 initial configuration.* Operate Windows PCs with a standard user (non\\-administrator) account. Administrator accounts should be used only when necessary.* Ensure there are no untrusted files in the directory where the application is installed.* Confirm no untrusted files exist in the same directory before double\\-clicking project file or copying the project file to a trusted directory or a newly\\-created temporary directory.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  .
