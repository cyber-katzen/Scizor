EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.3\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Omron\nEquipment: Network Configurator for DeviceNet\u00a0\nVulnerability: Untrusted Search Path\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-134-01 Omron Network Configurator for DeviceNet that was published May 14, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution under the privileges of the application.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Network Configurator for DeviceNet Safety are affected:\n\nNetwork Configurator for DeviceNet Safety 3.41 and prior\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNTRUSTED SEARCH PATH CWE-426\nThe application searches for resources by means of an untrusted search path that could execute a malicious .dll file not under the application's direct control and outside the intended directories.\nCVE-2019-10971 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nThe researcher with the handle n0b0dy sent information to CISA, leading to the discovery of this vulnerability.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nOmron has released Version 3.42 of Network Configurator for DeviceNet Safety to address the reported vulnerability. Users can download the latest version of Network Configurator for DeviceNet Safety.\nOmron has recommended applying the following for further mitigation:\n\nRemove or restrict directories listed in the PATH environment variable.\nEnsure system directories are writable only by administrators, which is Windows\u2019 initial configuration.\nOperate Windows PCs with a standard user (non-administrator) account. Administrator accounts should be used only when necessary.\nEnsure there are no untrusted files in the directory where the application is installed.\nConfirm no untrusted files exist in the same directory before double-clicking project file or copying the project file to a trusted directory or a newly-created temporary directory.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nCISA also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
