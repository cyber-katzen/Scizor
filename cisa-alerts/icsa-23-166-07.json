For the most up\\-to\\-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services \\| Services \\| Siemens Global).](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC WinCC V7* **Vulnerability:**  Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges if a non\\-default installation path was chosen during installation.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products from Siemens are affected:* SIMATIC WinCC: All versions prior to V7\\.5\\.2\\.13### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE\\-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)** Affected applications fail to set proper access rights for their installation folder if a non\\-default installation path was chosen during installation.\u00a0 This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.[CVE\\-2023\\-30897](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30897)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* SIMATIC WinCC: Update to [V7\\.5\\.2\\.13](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793460/)  or later version.* Always use the default installation path when installing SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.* After installation to a non\\-default folder, ensure that the access permissions of that folder are equal to the permissions of the Program Files folder.* Harden the application server to prevent local access by untrusted personnel. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-914026 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-914026.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-914026.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
