MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:\n \n\n\n* [Update to V3\\.2\\.7 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109814809/)\n\n\n\n Siemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* Restrict access to affected systems, especially to ports 22/TCP, 80/TCP, 443/TCP, and 161/UDP to only trusted IP addresses.\n* Disable the simple network management protocol (SNMP) service if not required and if the product supports disabling.\n* Deactivate the webserver if not required and if the product supports deactivation.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\n [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens Industrial Security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact\n [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-363821 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-363821.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-363821.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\n [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
