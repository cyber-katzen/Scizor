MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has provided the following updates for mitigations:* EN100 Ethernet module DNP3 variant (All versions prior to v1\\.04\\): Update to v1\\.04 and configure maintenance password, which can be located here: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/ view/109745821>* EN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant (All versions prior to v4\\.30\\): Update to v4\\.30, which can be located here: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109745821>**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * EN100 Ethernet module IEC 104 variant: Update to v1\\.22, which can be located here: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109745821>**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For all other affected products, Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations and Defense\\-in\\-Depth can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity> For further inquiries on vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> For more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see Siemens security notification SSA\\-845879 on their website: [https://cert\\-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa\\-845879\\.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-845879.pdf)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
