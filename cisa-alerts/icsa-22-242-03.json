A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated for the worst case; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Energy\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Switzerland\n\n\n### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy reported to CISA that MSM products were affected by these previously discovered vulnerabilities in various open\\-source software components.\n \n\n\n4\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from outside attacks:\n \n\n\n* Physically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.\n* Separate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with only the necessary ports open.\n* Process control systems should not be used for common internet activities.\n* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for malicious software before connecting to a control system.\n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy also recommends following the hardening guidelines published by\n [The Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/) \n to protect hosts connected with MSM. This measure will prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via such connected devices. Examples for Windows computers include:\n \n\n\n* [Securing Microsoft Windows Desktop](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_desktop)\n* [Securing Microsoft Windows Server](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_server)\n\n\n\n For more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory\n [8DBD000086](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000086) \n\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/news-events/news/targeted-cyber-intrusion-detection-and-mitigation-strategies-update-b) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
