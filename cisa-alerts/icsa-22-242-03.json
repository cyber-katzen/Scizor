EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: MSM Product\nVulnerability: Reliance on Uncontrolled Component\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could disrupt the functionality of the MSM web interface, steal sensitive user credentials, or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nHitachi Energy reports multiple open-source software related vulnerabilities in the following MSM product versions:\u00a0\n\nMSM version 2.2 and earlier.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELIANCE ON UNCONTROLLED COMPONENT CWE-1357\nHitachi Energy is aware of public reports of multiple vulnerabilities in open-source software components (JQuery, GoAhead Embedded Webserver, and Curl) used in MSM products. Versions are available to remediate the identified vulnerabilities.\nCVE-2015-6584, CVE-2016-7103, CVE-2011-4273, CVE-2018-16842, CVE-2016-9586, CVE-2016-8617, CVE-2016-8618, CVE-2016-8619, CVE-2016-8621, CVE-2016-7167, CVE-2014-3707, CVE-2013-2174, and CVE-2014-0138, have been assigned to these vulnerabilities in open-source components used by MSM. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated for the worst case; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported to CISA that MSM products were affected by these previously discovered vulnerabilities in various open-source software components.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from outside attacks:\n\nPhysically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.\nSeparate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with only the necessary ports open.\nProcess control systems should not be used for common internet activities.\nPortable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for malicious software before connecting to a control system.\n\nHitachi Energy also recommends following the hardening guidelines published by The Center for Internet Security (CIS) to protect hosts connected with MSM. This measure will prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via such connected devices. Examples for Windows computers include:\n\nSecuring Microsoft Windows Desktop\u00a0\nSecuring Microsoft Windows Server\n\nFor more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000086\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n",
