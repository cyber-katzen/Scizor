EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC CP 442\\-1 RNA, 443\\-1 RNA* **Vulnerability:**  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products are affected:* SIMATIC CP 442\\-1 RNA: All versions prior to v1\\.5\\.18* SIMATIC CP 443\\-1 RNA: All versions prior to v1\\.5\\.18### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) The affected devices improperly handle excessive ARP broadcast requests. This could allow an attacker to create a denial\\-of\\-service condition by performing ARP storming attacks, which can cause the device to reboot.[CVE\\-2022\\-27640](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-27640)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users update to the latest software versions:* SIMATIC CP 442\\-1 RNA: [Update to v1\\.5\\.18](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109808794/)  or later* SIMATIC CP 443\\-1 RNA: [Update to v1\\.5\\.18](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109808796)  or later As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-480937](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-480937.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
