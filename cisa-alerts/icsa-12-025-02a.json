This web page release was delayed to allow users time to download and install the update.\nResearcher Kuang-Chun Hung of the Security Research and Service Institute\u2212Information and Communication Security Technology Center (ICST) identified an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability (often called DLL hijacking), commonly referred to as DLL Hijacking, in the 7-Technologies (7T) TERMIS software.\nICS-CERT has coordinated this report with 7T, and 7T has created a patch that resolves this vulnerability. ICST has confirmed this patch fully resolves the reported vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nThe following products and versions are affected:\n\nTERMIS V2.10 dated November 30, 2011, and any previous version.\n\nImpact\nA successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\n7T, based in Denmark, creates monitoring and control systems that are primarily used in the United States, Europe, and South Asia. 7T TERMIS software is used for district energy network management.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nThe 7T TERMIS software is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking.CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html, website last accessed February 15, 2012. An attacker may place a malicious DLL in a directory where it will be loaded before the valid DLL. An attacker must have access to the host file system to exploit this vulnerability. If exploited, this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nCVE-2012-0223 has been assigned to this vulnerability.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------- \nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability may be exploitable from a remote machine.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker requires a moderate skill level to exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\n7T has developed a patch to address this vulnerability, which can be accessed here: http://termis.s3.amazonaws.com/TERMIS_2.10_18-01-2012.exe. Users may need to uninstall an earlier version of the application before installing this update.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks or more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
