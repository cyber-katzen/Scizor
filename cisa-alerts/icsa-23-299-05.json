EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: FactoryTalk View Site Edition\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the product to become unavailable and require a restart to recover resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports that the following versions of FactoryTalk View Site Edition are affected:\n\nFactoryTalk View Site Edition: V11.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nFactoryTalk View Site Edition V11.0 insufficiently validates user input, which could potentially allow threat actors to send malicious data bringing the product offline. If exploited, the product would become unavailable and require a restart to recover resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-46289\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has provided\u00a0patches for these versions v11.0 & v12.0 & v13.0.\nRockwell Automation encourages users of the affected software to apply the risk mitigations if possible. Additionally, they encourage users to implement their suggested\u00a0security best practices\u00a0to minimize the risk\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation's security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\u00a0\n5.
