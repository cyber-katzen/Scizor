As such, it is essential that each organization assess their environment to determine the applicability of the risks, and apply appropriate mitigation techniques in accordance with Cisco\u2019s guidance.\nThe noted vulnerabilities (denial of service (DoS) and remote authentication bypass) can directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of control systems. In addition to remediating the noted vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT advises organizations to employ multiple layers of security controls and monitoringhttp://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf (defense in depth) to minimize overall risk.\nAffected Products\nCisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) software for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers is affected by the following vulnerabilitiesMultiple versions of software are impacted \u2013 Reference Software Versions and Fixes section of the advisory: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131009-fwsm:\n\nCisco FWSM Command Authorization Vulnerability\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software is affected by the following vulnerabilitiesMultiple versions of software are impacted \u2013 Reference Software Versions and Fixes section of the advisory: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131009-asa:\n\nIPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\nDigital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\nClientless SSL VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nImpact\nThe noted vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a software release that is affected by a particular vulnerability might not be impacted by another.\nFirewall Services Module (FWSM) software for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers:\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the Cisco FWSM Command Authorization Vulnerability may result in a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system.\nSuccessful exploitation of the SQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) hardware:\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability, SQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, HTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability, DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability, and Clientless SSL VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\nSuccessful exploitation of the Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability, Remote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability, and Digital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability may result in an authentication bypass, which could allow the attacker access to the inside network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM).\nSuccessful exploitation of the AnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability may exhaust available memory, which could result in general system instability and cause the affected system to become unresponsive and stop forwarding traffic.\n\nVulnerability Characterization & Mitigation\nPlease reference the Cisco advisories for additional vulnerability details and mitigation strategies. Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Consult the Cisco advisories for information on obtaining upgraded software.\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks:\n\nDisable any unnecessary features or services within the device running configuration;\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n\n",
