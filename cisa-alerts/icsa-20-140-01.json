[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRockwell Automation EDS Subsystem================================= Last Revised May 20, 2020 Alert Code ICSA\\-20\\-140\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.2*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable from adjacent network/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Rockwell Automation* **Equipment:**  EDS Subsystem* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, SQL Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products that utilize the EDS Subsystem (Version 28\\.0\\.1 and prior) are affected:* FactoryTalk Linx software (Previously called RSLinx Enterprise): Versions 6\\.00, 6\\.10, and 6\\.11* RSLinx Classic: Version 4\\.11\\.00 and prior* RSNetWorx software: Version 28\\.00\\.00 and prior* Studio 5000 Logix Designer software: Version 32 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the algorithm that matches square brackets in the EDS subsystem. This may allow an attacker to craft specialized EDS files to crash the EDSParser COM object, leading to denial\\-of\\-service conditions.[CVE\\-2020\\-12038](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12038)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) The EDS subsystem does not provide adequate input sanitization, which may allow an attacker to craft specialized EDS files to inject SQL queries and manipulate the database storing the EDS files. This may lead to denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) conditions or allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL engine to write or modify files on the system.[CVE\\-2020\\-12034](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12034)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sharon Brizinov and Amir Preminger (VP Research) of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Rockwell Automation and CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation recommends the following:* Apply patch by following the instructions in knowledgebase article [RAid 1125928](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1125928)  (login required). Network\\-based vulnerability mitigations for embedded products:* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol\\-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP Ports 2222, 7153 and UDP Port 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see Knowledgebase Article ID [898270](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/898270) General mitigations:* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. For more information please refer to Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory [54102\\-Industrial Security Advisory Index](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/54102)  . CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
