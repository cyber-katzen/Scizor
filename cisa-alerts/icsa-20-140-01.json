EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: EDS Subsystem\nVulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, SQL Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products that utilize the EDS Subsystem (Version 28.0.1 and prior) are affected:\n\nFactoryTalk Linx software (Previously called RSLinx Enterprise): Versions 6.00, 6.10, and 6.11\nRSLinx Classic: Version 4.11.00 and prior\nRSNetWorx software: Version 28.00.00 and prior\nStudio 5000 Logix Designer software: Version 32 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nA memory corruption vulnerability exists in the algorithm that matches square brackets in the EDS subsystem. This may allow an attacker to craft specialized EDS files to crash the EDSParser COM object, leading to denial-of-service conditions.\nCVE-2020-12038 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nThe EDS subsystem does not provide adequate input sanitization, which may allow an attacker to craft specialized EDS files to inject SQL queries and manipulate the database storing the EDS files. This may lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL engine to write or modify files on the system.\nCVE-2020-12034 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSharon Brizinov and Amir Preminger (VP Research) of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Rockwell Automation and CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends the following:\n\nApply patch by following the instructions in knowledgebase article RAid 1125928 (login required).\n\nNetwork-based vulnerability mitigations for embedded products:\n\nBlock all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP Ports 2222, 7153 and UDP Port 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270\n\nGeneral mitigations:\n\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information please refer to Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory 54102-Industrial Security Advisory Index.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
