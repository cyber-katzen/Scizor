MITIGATIONS--------------- TEL\\-STER recommends that users [update WebInterface module](https://www.tel-ster.pl/index.php/en/telwin-scada-eng/news-telwin-eng)  to one of the following versions: 6\\.2, 7\\.2, 8\\.1, 9\\.1, or 10\\.0\\. Please note that the WebInterface is part of the TelWin SCADA software and is usually updated with the software. TEL\\-STER only currently supports and updates TelWin SCADA 7\\.8 (WebInteraface 6\\.x) upwards TEL\\-STER does not have any updates planned for versions using older vulnerable WebInterface (lower than 6\\.0\\), and users are recommended to update TelWin SCADA to one of the supported versions. For more information, please contact TEL\\-STER. More information about this issue and the associated mitigation can be found at [TEL\\-STER advisory](https://www.tel-ster.pl/index.php/telwin-scada/nowosci/372-telwin-scada-podatnosc-cve-2023-0956)  or [CERT.PL advisory](https://cert.pl/posts/2023/07/CVE-2023-0956/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
