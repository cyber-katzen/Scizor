EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Weintek\nEquipment: cMT3000 CMI Web CGI\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to hijack control flow and bypass login authentication or execute arbitrary commands.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Weintek products are affected:\n\ncMT-FHD: OS version 20210210 or prior.\ncMT-HDM: OS version 20210204 or prior.\ncMT3071: OS version 20210218 or prior.\ncMT3072: OS version 20210218 or prior.\ncMT3103: OS version 20210218 or prior.\ncMT3090: OS version 20210218 or prior.\ncMT3151: OS version 20210218 or prior.\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nIn Weintek's cMT3000 HMI Web CGI device, the cgi-bin command_wb.cgi contains a stack-based buffer overflow, which could allow an anonymous attacker to hijack control flow and bypass login authentication.\nCVE-2023-38584\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nIn Weintek's cMT3000 HMI Web CGI device, an anonymous attacker can execute arbitrary commands after login to the device.\nCVE-2023-40145\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nIn Weintek's cMT3000 HMI Web CGI device, the cgi-bin codesys.cgi contains a stack-based buffer overflow, which could allow an anonymous attacker to hijack control flow and bypass login authentication.\nCVE-2023-43492\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHank Chen (PSIRT and Threat Research of TXOne Networks) reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWeintek recommends users follow their\u00a0Upgrade Instructions\u00a0to update the following products to the latest versions:\n\ncMT-FHD: OS version 20210211\ncMT-HDM: OS version 20210205\ncMT3071: OS version 20210219\ncMT3072: OS version 20210219\ncMT3103: OS version 20210219\ncMT3090: OS version 20210219\ncMT3151: OS version 20210219\n\nFor additional information, refer to\u00a0Weintek's security bulletin.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
