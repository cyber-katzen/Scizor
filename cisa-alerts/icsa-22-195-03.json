[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SIMATIC MV500 Devices============================= Last Revised July 14, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-195\\-031\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.0*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC MV500 Devices* **Vulnerabilities:**  Insufficient Session Expiration, Missing Authentication for Critical Function2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to hijack other users\u2019 web\\-based management sessions or access data on the device without prior authentication.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SIMATIC MV500 Devices, Optical Readers, are affected:* SIMATIC MV540 H (6GF3540\\-0GE10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3* SIMATIC MV540 S (6GF3540\\-0CD10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3* SIMATIC MV550 H (6GF3550\\-0GE10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3* SIMATIC MV550 S (6GF3550\\-0CD10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3* SIMATIC MV560 U (6GF3560\\-0LE10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3* SIMATIC MV560 X (6GF3560\\-0HE10\\): All versions prior to v3\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATION CWE\\-613](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html) The web session management of affected devices does not invalidate session IDs in certain logout scenarios. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to hijack other users\u2019 sessions.[CVE\\-2022\\-33137](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-33137)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) Affected devices do not perform authentication for several web API endpoints. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read and download data from the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-33138](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-33138)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software:* SIMATIC MV540 H: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/)* SIMATIC MV540 S: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/)* SIMATIC MV550 H: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/)* SIMATIC MV550 S: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/)* SIMATIC MV560 U: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/)* SIMATIC MV560 X: Update to [v3\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811878/) As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals.
