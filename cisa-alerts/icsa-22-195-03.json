EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC MV500 Devices\nVulnerabilities: Insufficient Session Expiration, Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to hijack other users\u2019 web-based management sessions or access data on the device without prior authentication.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SIMATIC MV500 Devices, Optical Readers, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC MV540 H (6GF3540-0GE10): All versions prior to v3.3\nSIMATIC MV540 S (6GF3540-0CD10): All versions prior to v3.3\nSIMATIC MV550 H (6GF3550-0GE10): All versions prior to v3.3\nSIMATIC MV550 S (6GF3550-0CD10): All versions prior to v3.3\nSIMATIC MV560 U (6GF3560-0LE10): All versions prior to v3.3\nSIMATIC MV560 X (6GF3560-0HE10): All versions prior to v3.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATION CWE-613\nThe web session management of affected devices does not invalidate session IDs in certain logout scenarios. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to hijack other users\u2019 sessions.\nCVE-2022-33137 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAffected devices do not perform authentication for several web API endpoints. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read and download data from the device.\nCVE-2022-33138 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software:\n\nSIMATIC MV540 H: Update to v3.3 or later\nSIMATIC MV540 S: Update to v3.3 or later\nSIMATIC MV550 H: Update to v3.3 or later\nSIMATIC MV550 S: Update to v3.3 or later\nSIMATIC MV560 U: Update to v3.3 or later\nSIMATIC MV560 X: Update to v3.3 or later\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information, see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-348662.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
