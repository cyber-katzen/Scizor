A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Netherlands### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Shawn Loveric of Finite State, Inc., reported these vulnerabilities to Philips.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- WLAN Version B is obsolete. Philips recommends users update to the WLAN assembly Version C wireless module in affected IntelliVue monitors. WLAN Version C with current firmware of B.00\\.31 is not vulnerable to the described attack. WLAN Version A is a software patch from Philips estimated to be available in Incenter by the end of 2019\\. Wireless network access should be controlled by authentication and authorization (e.g., WPA2\\), which are supported by Philips. As an additional mitigation measure, Philips recommends implementing a firewall rule on the user\u2019s wireless network to restrict access control via FTP. Users should implement role\\-based access controls to control physical access to the system. Refer to the Security for Clinical Networks Guide and the IntelliVue Network Configuration Guide for additional security recommendations. Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products:<https://www.philips.com/productsecurity> CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.* Apply defense\\-in\\-depth strategies.* Disable unnecessary accounts and services. Where additional information is needed, follow this [link to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm)  . CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.
