Sixnet has produced a new version of the remote terminal unit (RTU) firmware that mitigates this vulnerability.\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 ----------\nThe Intelligent Systems Research Lab at the University of Louisville has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Sixnet products are affected:\n\nVersions older than UDR 2.0, and\nRTU firmware older than Version 4.8\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker who has access to the network where this RTU is located may use undocumented function codes to obtain file descriptors and file sizes, to read and write to files, to create new files, or to open a shell on the target machine to execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSixnet is a US-based company owned by Red Lion Controls.\nThe affected RTU products, RTU firmware, are SCADA systems that send real-time data from distributed locations to a human-machine interface in a central location. According to Sixnet, their RTU products are deployed across several sectors including energy, transportation, commercial facilities, and finance. Sixnet estimates that these products are used primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNDOCUMENTED FUNCTION CODESCWE-912: Hidden Functionality, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/912.html, Web site last accessed September 17, 2013.\n\nThere are undocumented functions available to use in the Sixnet universal protocol. The researcher found six different opcodes that allow a user (or an attacker) to execute file and shell tasks. The device does not require an authenticated session before it accepts these opcodes.\nCVE-2013-2802NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2802, Web site last accessed September 17, 2013.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, Web site last accessed September 17, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nAn attacker must have access to the network where the RTU is located.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSixnet has released a new version of the RTU firmware, Version 4.8, which adds authentication so that only authorized users may access the device. Please contact Sixnet supportContact Sixnet Tech Support, http://www.sixnet.com/department/technical-support-155.cfm, Web site last accessed September 17, 2013.\u00a0for more information about this issue and firmware Version 4.8 at (518) 877-5173 or support@sixnet.com.\nSixnet software and firmware downloads are available at the following location on its Web site:\nhttp://www.sixnet.com/department/automation-devices-software-firmware-180.cfm\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,\u00a0that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
