The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786\\. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device.[CVE\\-2018\\-0171](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0171)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.2 [RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ERRORS\u00a0CWE\\-399](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399.html) A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to an affected device on TCP port 4786\\.[CVE\\-2018\\-0156](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0156)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION\u00a0CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4\\) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0174](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0174)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION\u00a0CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4\\) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap overflow condition on the affected device, which will cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0172](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0172)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.5 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION\u00a0CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software function that restores encapsulated option 82 information in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4\\) packets could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of encapsulated option 82 information that it receives in DHCPOFFER messages from DHCPv4 servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device, which the device would then forward to a DHCPv4 server. When the affected software processes the option 82 information that is encapsulated in the response from the server, an error could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0173](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0173)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.2\\.6 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION\u00a0CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2\\) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a DoS condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2018\\-0158](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0158)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

CVE\\-2018\\-0167 and CVE\\-2018\\-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco Vulnerability advisory for more details:[https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco\\-sa\\-20180328\\-lldp](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp)  Rockwell Automation also recommends users implement the following general security guidelines:* Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .
