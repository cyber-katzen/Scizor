Public exploits are available.\nVendor: PEPPERL+FUCHS/ecom instruments\nEquipment: WLAN capable devices using the WPA2 Protocol\nVulnerabilities: Reusing a Nonce\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nPEPPERL+FUCHS/ecom instruments reports that these vulnerabilities affect all versions of the following WLAN capable devices using the WPA2 Protocol:\n\nTab-Ex 01,\nEx-Handy 09,\nEx-Handy 209,\nSmart-Ex 01,\nSmart-Ex 201,\nPad-Ex 01,\ni.roc Ci70-Ex,\nCK70A-ATEX,\nCK71A-ATEX,\nCN70A-ATEX, and\nCN70E-ATEX.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to operate as a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d between the device and the wireless access point.\nMITIGATION\nPEPPERL+FUCHS/ecom instruments report the following mitigations:\nAndroid\n\nAffected Products: Tab-Ex 01, Ex-Handy 09, Ex-Handy 209, Smart-Ex 01, Smart-Ex 201\necom instruments is actively working on these vulnerabilities. This advisory will updated as soon as further significant details are provided by the vendor, with an emphasis on information about available patches.\n\nWindows\n\nAffected Products: Pad-Ex 01, i.roc Ci70-Ex, CK70A-ATEX, CK71A-ATEX, CN70A-ATEX, CN70E-ATEX\nFor ecom instruments devices running Windows, ecom instruments recommends users apply the security update provided by Microsoft. If users are using WPA-TKIP in their WLAN, users should switch to AES-CCMP immediately.\n\nFor more information CERT@VDE has released a security advisory found at:\nhttps://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2017-005\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nREUSING A NONCE, KEY PAIR IN ENCRYPTION CWE-323\n\nMultiple products are affected by key reinstallation attacks known as KRACK. The four-way hand shake traffic in the Wi-Fi Protected Access WPA and WPA2 protocol can be manipulated to allow nonce reuse resulting in key reinstallation. This could allow an attacker to execute a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack, enabling the attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.\nThe following CVEs have been assigned to this group of vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-13077: Reinstallation of the pairwise key during the four-way handshake.\nCVE-2017-13078: Reinstallation of the group key during the four-way handshake.\nCVE-2017-13079: Reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the four-way handshake.\nCVE-2017-13080: Reinstallation of the group key during the group key handshake.\nCVE-2017-13081: Reinstallation of the IGTK during the group key handshake.\nCVE-2017-13082: Reinstallation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) Temporal Key (TK) during the fast BSS transmission (FT) handshake.\nCVE-2017-13086: Reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) Peer Key (TPK) during the TDLS handshake.\nCVE-2017-13087: Reinstallation of the Group Temporal Key (GTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame.\nCVE-2017-13088: Reinstallation of the IGTK when processing a WNM Sleep Mode Response frame.\nA CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nMathy Vanhoef of imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven discovered these vulnerabilities. PEPPERL+FUCHS reported to CERT@VDE that their products are affected. CERT@VDE coordinated these vulnerabilities with ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Germany\n",
