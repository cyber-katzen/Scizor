EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Geutebr\u00fcck GmbH\nEquipment: E2 Camera Series\nVulnerability: OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to inject OS commands as root.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nGeutebr\u00fcck reports the vulnerability affect the following IP cameras:E2 series cameras running firmware versions prior to 1.12.0.25\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78The DDNS configuration (in the Network Configuration panel) is vulnerable to an OS system command injection as root.CVE-2018-19007 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Financial Services, Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Europe, United States, Australia\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDavy Douhine of RandoriSec reported this vulnerability to NCCIC. The researcher has validated that the new version of the firmware resolves the reported vulnerability.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGeutebr\u00fcck recommends E2 series IP camera users download and update to the newest firmware version, 1.12.0.25, by registering for a new WebClub account, or by logging into an existing account at the following location:https://www.geutebrueck.com//en_EN/login.html\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
