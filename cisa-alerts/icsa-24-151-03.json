EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Inosoft\nEquipment: VisiWin\nVulnerability: Incorrect Default Permissions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Inosoft products are affected:\n\nVisiWin 7: All versions prior to version 2024-1\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nVisiWin creates a directory with insufficient permissions, allowing a low-level user the ability to add and modify certain files that hold SYSTEM privileges, which could lead to privilege escalation.\nCVE-2023-31468 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2023-31468. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a PoC (Proof of concept) as authored by Carlo Di Dato and reported it to Inosoft.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nInosoft recommends users to update to VisiWin version 2024-1.\nFor more information, please visit VisiWin's support page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
