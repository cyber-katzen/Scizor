EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Datakit\nEquipment: Software libraries embedded in Luxion KeyShot software\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Stack-Based buffer Overflow, Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Out-of-bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to execution of arbitrary code and disclosure of arbitrary files to unauthorized actors.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following modules of Datakit CrossCADWare, Versions 2021.1 and earlier, a library embedded in end-user applications, are affected:\n\nCatiaV5_3dRead\nCatiaV6_3dRead\nStep3dRead\nUg3dReadPsr\nJt3dReadPsr\n\nThe following versions of Luxion software, 3D rendering and animation software, are bundled with the affected Datakit libraries:\n\nKeyShot: Versions v10.1 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nAffected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CATPart files. This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-27488 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTIONS ON XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611\nWhen opening a specially crafted 3DXML file, the application could disclose arbitrary files to remote attackers. This is because of the passing of specially crafted content to the underlying XML parser without taking proper restrictions such as prohibiting an external DTD.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-27492 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nAffected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing STP files. This could result in a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-27494 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\nAffected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PRT files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from an untrusted source. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-27496 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-27490 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nrgod, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDatakit has released CrossCAD/Ware library Version 2021.2 and recommends software vendors upgrade to this version or later. Versions 2021.1 or earlier are still affected by the vulnerabilities.\nDatakit recommends that users of these applications should avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources.\nLuxion has released an update to KeyShot (v10.2), as it is bundled with Datakit 2021.2, and recommends users update to the latest version.\nLuxion has published security advisory LSA-394129 for the affected products.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
