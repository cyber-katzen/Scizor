EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Moxa\nEquipment: PT-7528 Series and PT-7828 Series\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Weak Password Requirements, Information Exposure\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device or allow access to sensitive information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMoxa reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Ethernet switches:\n\nPT-7528 series firmware, Version 4.0 or lower\nPT-7828 series firmware, Version 3.9 or lower\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nA buffer overflow in the web server allows remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2020-6989 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H ).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327\nThe affected products use a weak cryptographic algorithm, which may allow confidential information to be disclosed.\nCVE-2020-6987 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nThe affected products use a hard-coded cryptographic key, which increases the possibility that confidential data can be recovered.\nCVE-2020-6983 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThese devices use a hard-coded service code for access to the console.\nCVE-2020-6985 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS CWE-521\nThe application utilizes weak password requirements, which may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access.\nCVE-2020-6995 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\nAn attacker can access to sensitive information from the web service without authorization.\nCVE-2020-6993 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIlya Karpov and Evgeniy Druzhinin from Rostelecom-Solar and Georgy Zaytsev of Positive Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Moxa.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMoxa has developed a solution to address these vulnerabilities: Please contact Moxa Technical Support for a security patch.\nMoxa also recommends that users apply the security patch and enable \u201cAccount Login Failure Lockout\u201d functions to eliminate any potential risk.\nPlease see Moxa\u2019s security advisory for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
