EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 4\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : TIA Administrator* **Vulnerability**  : Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to disrupt the update process.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Siemens TIA Administrator, a web\\-based framework, are affected:* TIA Administrator: All versions prior to V3 SP2### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**CREATION OF TEMPORARY FILE IN DIRECTORY WITH INSECURE PERMISSIONS CWE\\-379**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html) The affected component creates temporary download files in a directory with insecure permissions. This could allow any authenticated attacker on Windows to disrupt the update process.[CVE\\-2023\\-38533](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38533)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 3\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2023\\-38533](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38533)  . A base score of 4\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users to update to the latest version:* TIA Adminstrator: [Update to V3 SP2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109825038/)  or later version As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-319319 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-319319.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-319319.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.5\\.
