RISK EVALUATION\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 5 ---------\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to send specially crafted requests and cause a loss of sensitive information.\u00a0\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 5 ---------\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS), are affected:\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A part 3 of 5 ---------\nCVE-2022-44456\u00a0\n\nCONPROSYS HMI System (CHS): Ver.3.4.4 and prior\u00a0\n\nCVE-2023-22331, CVE-2023-22334, CVE-2023-22373, CVE-2023-22339\u00a0\n\nCONPROSYS HMI System (CHS): Ver.3.4.5 and prior\u00a0\n\n--------- End Update A part 3 of 5 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1 OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nCONPROSYS HMI System versions 3.4.4 and prior are vulnerable to an OS Command Injection, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted requests that could execute commands on the server.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-44456 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A part 4 of 5 ---------\n4.2.2 USE OF DEFAULT CREDENTIALS CWE-1392\u00a0\nIn CONPROSYS HMI System Ver.3.4.5 and prior, user credential information could be altered by a remote unauthenticated attacker.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22331 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n4.2.3\u00a0USE OF PASSWORD HASH INSTEAD OF PASSWORD FOR AUTHENTICATION CWE-836\u00a0\nIn CONPROSYS HMI System Ver.3.4.5 and prior, user credentials could be obtained via a machine-in-the-middle attack.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22334 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n4.2.4\u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\u00a0\nIn CONPROSYS HMI System Ver.3.4.5 and prior, an arbitrary script could be executed on the web browser of the administrative user logging into the product. This could result in sensitive information being obtained. \u00a0\nCVE-2023-22373 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n4.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\u00a0\nIn CONPROSYS HMI System Ver.3.4.5 and prior, a remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain the server certificate, including the private key of the product.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22339 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n--------- End Update A part 4 of 5 ---------\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nFloris Hendriks and Jeroen Wijenbergh of Radboud University reported this vulnerability to Contec.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A part 5 of 5 ---------\nContec recommends users update to CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) Ver.3.5.0 or later.\u00a0\n--------- End Update A part 5 of 5 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
