MITIGATIONS--------------- \u200bSiemens recommends updating the following products to the latest version:* \u200bCP\\-8050 MASTER MODULE (6MF2805\\-0AA00\\): [Update to CPCI85 V05](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804985)  or later version* \u200bCP\\-8031 MASTER MODULE (6MF2803\\-1AA00\\): [Update to CPCI85 V05](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804985)  or later version \u200bOperators of critical power systems (e.g., TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi\\-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines to run the devices in a protected IT environment. \u200bRecommended security guidelines can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity> . \u200bFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  . \u200bAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. \u200bAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . \u200bFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-731916 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-731916.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-731916.json)  . \u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. \u200bCISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . \u200bAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . \u200bOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. \u200bNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
