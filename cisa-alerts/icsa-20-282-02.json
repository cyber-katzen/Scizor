EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: MELSEC iQ-R Series\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-20-282-02 Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-R Series (Update B) that was published February 18, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following MELSEC iQ-R series modules are affected:\n\nR00/01/02CPU, Firmware Versions 20 and earlier\nR04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU, Firmware Versions 52 and earlier\nR08/16/32/120SFCPU, Firmware Versions 22 and earlier\nR08/16/32/120PCPU, Firmware Versions 25 and earlier\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nR08/16/32/120PSFCPU, Firmware Versions 06 and earlier\nR16/32/64MTCPU, Firmware Versions 21 and earlier\n\n--------- End Update C Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nAn uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) vulnerability resulting in a denial-of-service condition may be caused when an attacker sends specially crafted packets to MELSEC iQ-R series modules.\nCVE-2020-16850 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nYossi Reuven of SCADAfence reported this vulnerability to Mitsubishi Electric.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nThe following modules have been patched:\n\nR00/01/02CPU: Firmware Versions 21 or later\nR04/08/16/32/120CPU, R04/08/16/32/120ENCPU: Firmware Versions 53 or later\nR08/16/32/120SFCPU: Firmware Versions 23 or later\nR08/16/32/120PCPU: Firmware Versions 26 or later\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nR08/16/32/120PSFCPU: Firmware Versions 07 or later\nR16/32/64MTCPU: Firmware Versions 22 or later\n\nMitsubishi Electric plans to release a patch during the coming months, and this publication will be updated with that patch information once available. Please contact a Mitsubishi Electric representative for additional details.\n--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:\n\nUse a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc., to prevent unauthorized access if Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
