A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nUK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reported this vulnerability to AVEVA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA has released the following fixes for the following products: \u00a0\n\nAVEVA Plant SCADA\u00a0\nAll affected versions in \u201cmainstream support\u201d can be fixed by upgrading to\u00a0AVEVA Plant SCADA 2023 Update 1\u00a0or later.\u00a0\nAVEVA Plant SCADA 2020R2 can alternatively be patched with\u00a0AVEVA Plant SCADA 2020R2 Update 11\u00a0or later.\u00a0\n\nFor additional upgrade information, refer to the\u00a0AVEVA Plant SCADA upgrade guide.\u00a0\n\nAVEVA Telemetry Server\u00a0\nAll affected versions in \u201cmainstream support\u201d can be fixed by upgrading to\u00a0AVEVA Telemetry Server 2020 R2 SP2\u00a0or later.\u00a0\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, including security updates, users should see security bulletin\u00a0AVEVA-2023-002.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. \u00a0\n",
