GE Digital Energy has validated these vulnerabilities through testing and confirms that the issues affecting the ML800 will also affect the MultiLink series of managed Ethernet switches including the ML1200, ML1600, ML2400, ML810, ML3000, and ML3100\\. GE recommends that its customers upgrade switch firmware and disable the configuration web server to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed.\n \n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following GE Multilink Ethernet switch is affected:\n \n\n\n* GE Multilink ML800/1200/1600/2400 Version 4\\.2\\.1and prior, and\n* GE Multilink ML810/3000/3100 series switch Version 5\\.2\\.0 and prior.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n The GE Multilink ML800 is subject to unauthorized access via hard\\-coded credentials. In addition, availability can be impacted through attacks composed of specifically crafted packets to the web server resulting in switch performance degradation. If attacks continue, the web server will be subject to a denial of service. The cross\\-site scripting vulnerability could inject content into response pages from the web interface, allowing a malicious user to deliver unknown and potentially malicious scripts to other users of the web interface.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n GE is a US\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\n \n\n\n\n The Multilink ML800 series switch is a compact, hardened managed Ethernet switch designed specifically for use in industrial facilities, substations, and transportation environments. It provides high\\-speed networking with management functions and support for industrial/utility protocols and applications. According to GE, GE Multilink ML800 series switches are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. GE estimates that these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### RESOURCE CONSUMPTIONCWE\\-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400\\.html, web site last accessed January 13, 2015\\.\n\n\n\n\n Using specially crafted packets the device can be forced to exhaust its resources until performance degrades. Repeated malicious packets will exhaust the switch resources and cause the device to reboot in order to restore availability.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2014\\-5418NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-5418, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.
