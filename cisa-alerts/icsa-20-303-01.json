When the CPU module receives a specially crafted packet from a malicious attacker, Ethernet communication may enter a denial-of-service condition and a reset is required to recover it.\nCVE-2020-5652\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\njoker63 of ZheJiangQiAnTechnology reported this vulnerability to Mitsubishi Electric.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:\n\nUse a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\n\nPlease refer to Mitsubishi Electric's website for details on available patches.\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users update their products by downloading and applying the latest versions. Please contact a Mitsubishi Electric representative for additional details.\nFor specific additional details, see [Mitsubishi Electric advisory 2020-013].(https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-013_en.pdf).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
