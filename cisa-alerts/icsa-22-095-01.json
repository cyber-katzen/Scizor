RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Rockwell Automation products are affected:\n\nConnected Component Workbench: v13.00.00 and prior\nISaGRAF Workbench: v6.0 though v6.6.9\nSafety Instrumented Systems Workstation: v1.2 and prior (for Trusted Controllers)\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nConnected Components Workbench, ISaGRAF Workbench, and Safety Instrumented System Workstation do not limit the objects that can be deserialized. This allows attackers to craft a malicious serialized object that, if opened by a local user in Connected Components Workbench, may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability requires user interaction to be successfully exploited.\nCVE-2022-1118 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation encourages users to update to v20.00 or later.\nFor the ISaGRAF Workbench and Safety Instrumented Systems Workstation, Rockwell Automation encourages users to use mitigations listed below until a patch is released. More mitigation actions are planned.\u00a0\nIf an upgrade is not possible or available, users should apply the following mitigations:\n\nRun Connected Components Workbench as a User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.\nDo not open untrusted files with Connected Component Workbench, ISaGRAF, SISW. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.\nUse Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list application to help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at KnowledgeBase Article QA17329\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\n\nFor more information see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
