EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Red Lion Controls* **Equipment:**  Crimson* **Vulnerability:**  Path Traversal2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain user credential hashes.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Crimson, a programming software for various controllers, HMIs, and modules are affected:* Crimson 3\\.0: Version 707\\.000 and prior* Crimson 3\\.1: Version 3126\\.001 and prior* Crimson 3\\.2: Version 3\\.2\\.0044\\.0 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) Red Lion Controls Crimson 3\\.0 versions 707\\.000 and prior, Crimson 3\\.1 versions 3126\\.001 and prior, and Crimson 3\\.2 versions 3\\.2\\.0044\\.0 and prior are vulnerable to path traversal. When attempting to open a file using a specific path, the user's password hash is sent to an arbitrary host. This could allow an attacker to obtain user credential hashes.[CVE\\-2022\\-3090](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3090)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Dragos reported this vulnerability to Red Lion Controls, who reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Red Lion Controls recommends updating to the following versions or later:* Crimson 3\\.0: Version 711\\.00* Crimson 3\\.1: Version 3126\\.02* Crimson 3\\.2: Version 3\\.0045 Red Lion Controls also recommends the following guidelines to reduce the risk of this vulnerability:* Users should avoid opening files originating from outside the organization.* Users should verify files come from a trusted source prior to opening.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
