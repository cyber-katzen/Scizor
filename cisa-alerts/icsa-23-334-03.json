EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: PTC\nEquipment: KEPServerEX, ThingWorx, OPC-Aggregator\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker gaining Windows SYSTEM-level code execution on the service host and may cause the product to crash, leak sensitive information, or connect to the product without proper authentication.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following PTC Kepware products, are affected:\n\nKEPServerEX: v6.14.263.0 and prior\nThingWorx Kepware Server: v6.14.263.0 and prior\nThingWorx Industrial Connectivity: All versions\nOPC-Aggregator: v6.14 and prior\nThingWorx Kepware Edge: v1.7 and prior\nRockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise: Versions v6.14.263.0 and prior\nGE Digital Industrial Gateway Server: Versions v7.614 and prior\nSoftware Toolbox TOP Server: Versions v6.14.263.0 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nKEPServerEX is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which may allow an attacker to crash the product being accessed or leak information.\nCVE-2023-5908\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER VALIDATION OF CERTIFICATE WITH HOST MISMATCH CWE-297\nKEPServerEX does not properly validate certificates from clients which may allow unauthenticated users to connect.\nCVE-2023-5909\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nShawn Hoffman reported these vulnerabilities to PTC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPTC has released and recommends users update to the following versions:\n\nKEPServerEX should upgrade to v6.15 or later\nThingWorx Kepware Server should upgrade to v6.15 or later\nThingWorx Industrial Connectivity should upgrade to ThingWorx Kepware Server v6.15 or later\nOPC-Aggregator should upgrade to v6.15 or later\nThingWorx Kepware Edge: Upgrade to v1.8 or later\n\nRefer to secure configuration guide\u00a0here.\nIf additional questions remain, please contact\u00a0PTC Technical Support.\nFor more information, see PTC's\u00a0advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
