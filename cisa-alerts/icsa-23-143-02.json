RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash the device being accessed or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Hitachi Energy's RTU500 Series Product, are affected:\n\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 12.0.1 through 12.0.15\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 12.2.1 through 12.2.12\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 12.4.1 through 12.4.12\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 12.6.1 through 12.6.9\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 12.7.1 through 12.7.6\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 13.2.1 through 13.2.6\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 13.3.1 through 13.3.3\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware: version 13.4.1 through 13.4.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843\nThere is a type-confusion vulnerability affecting X.400 address processing within an X.509 GeneralName. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling access to read memory contents or cause a denial-of-service condition.X.400 addresses parsed as an ASN1_STRING while the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specifies the x400Address field type as ASN1_TYPE.\nCVE-2023-0286\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OBSERVABLE TIMING DISCREPANCY CWE-208\nA timing-based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation. This could allow an attacker sufficient access to recover plaintext across a network to perform a Bleichenbacher style attack. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\nCVE-2022-4304\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA vulnerability exists in the Wind River VxWorks version 6.9 affecting the RTU500 series product versions listed. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a specific crafted packet that could lead to an out-of-bounds read during an IKE initial exchange scenario.\nCVE-2022-23937\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835\nA vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL version 1.0.2 that affects the RTU500 Series product versions listed. An attacker can exploit the BN_mod_sqrt() function to compute a modular square root that contains a bug causing a continual loop for non-prime moduli.\nCVE-2022-0778\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nA vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL Version 1.0.2 affecting the RTU500 Series product versions listed. An attacker with access to applications and the capability to present SM2 content for decryption could cause a buffer overflow up to a maximum of 62 bytes while altering contents of data present after the buffer. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to change application behavior or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2021-3711\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL Version 1.0.2 affecting the RTU500 Series product versions listed. A malicious actor could cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions. Exploiting this vulnerability could create a system crash causing a denial-of-service condition or a disclosure of private memory contents, such as private keys or sensitive plaintext.\nCVE-2021-3712\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4.
