As NTP is widely used within operational industrial control systems deployments, ICS\\-CERT is providing this information for US critical infrastructure asset owners and operators for awareness and to identify mitigations for affected devices. ICS\\-CERT may release updates as additional information becomes available.\n \n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\n\n Products using NTP service prior to ntp\\-4\\.2\\.8p1 are affected. This is an open source protocol.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT sent out a query to vendors we have collaborated with in the past to develop a list of known impacted products. Over 20 vendors have responded back with information regarding if their products are affected by this NTP vulnerability. ICS\\-CERT has created a supplement to this advisory that contains vendor\\-supplied affected product information, which will be updated as new information is received, without updating this advisory. This supplement can be found at the following web location:\n [https://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA\\-14\\-353\\-01\\-Supplement](/ics/advisories/ICSA-14-353-01-Supplement) \n .\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update C Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ntpd process.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n NTP is described in RFC 958,Network Time Protocol (NTP), http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc958, web site last accessed February 04, 2015\\. 1305,Network Time Protocol (Version 3\\) Specification, Implementation and Analysis, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1305, web site last accessed February 04, 2015\\. and 5905Network Time Protocol (Version 4\\) Protocol and Algorithms Specification, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905, web site last accessed February 04, 2015\\.; IETF Standards documents that describe the protocol and algorithms used to synchronize time over a network. The reference implementation of these Standards comes from the open source project via the University of Delaware and Network Time Foundation, and is in wide use.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### INSUFFICIENT ENTROPYCWE\\-331: Insufficient Entropy, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331\\.html, web site last accessed December 19, 2014\\.\n\n\n\n\n If the authentication key is not set in the configuration file, ntpd will generate a weak random key with insufficient entropy.\n \n\n\n\n This vulnerability was resolved with NTP\\-dev4\\.2\\.7p11 on January 28, 2010\\.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2014\\-9293NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-9293, web site last accessed February 04, 2015\\. has been assigned by CERT/CC to this vulnerability.
