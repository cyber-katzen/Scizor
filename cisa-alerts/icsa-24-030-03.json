EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: MELSEC WS Series\nVulnerability: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized attacker to login to the modules and disclose or tamper with the programs and parameters in the modules.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC WS Series Ethernet Interface Modules, are affected:\n\nWS0-GETH00200: All serial numbers\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the MELSEC WS Series Ethernet Interface Modules. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication by capture-replay attack and login to the modules. As a result, the remote attacker who has logged in may be able to disclose or tamper with the programs and parameters in the modules.\nCVE-2023-6374\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends that users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:\n\nUse a virtual private network (VPN), etc. to encrypt the communication between affected products and the peer.\nUse a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\nRestrict physical access to affected products and to personal computers and network devices located in the LAN to which the affected products are connected.\n\nFor more information, see Mitsubishi Electric's\u00a0security advisory.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJanuary 30, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
