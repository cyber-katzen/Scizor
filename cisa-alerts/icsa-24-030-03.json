EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.9*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely* **Vendor**  : Mitsubishi Electric* **Equipment**  : MELSEC WS Series* **Vulnerability**  : Authentication Bypass by Capture\\-replay2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized attacker to login to the modules and disclose or tamper with the programs and parameters in the modules.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC WS Series Ethernet Interface Modules, are affected:* WS0\\-GETH00200: All serial numbers### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE\\-REPLAY CWE\\-294](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the MELSEC WS Series Ethernet Interface Modules. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication by capture\\-replay attack and login to the modules. As a result, the remote attacker who has logged in may be able to disclose or tamper with the programs and parameters in the modules.[CVE\\-2023\\-6374](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-6374)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Mitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends that users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:* Use a virtual private network (VPN), etc. to encrypt the communication between affected products and the peer.* Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.* Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Restrict physical access to affected products and to personal computers and network devices located in the LAN to which the affected products are connected.
