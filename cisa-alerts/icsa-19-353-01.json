EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Moxa\nEquipment: EDS-G508E, EDS-G512E, and EDS-G516E Series Ethernet Switches\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the target device to go out of service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMoxa reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n\nEDS-G508E Series: Firmware Version 6.0 and prior\nEDS-G512E Series: Firmware Version 6.0 and prior\nEDS-G516E Series: Firmware Version 6.0 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nPROFINET DCE-RPC diagnostic packets can cause the device to enter a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2019-19707 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYuval Ardon and Matan Dobrushin of Otorio reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMoxa has developed a patch to address the vulnerability. Users can contact Moxa Technical Support (logon required) for the security patch. Users can also view Moxa\u2019s security advisory published on this vulnerability.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
