RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition to any server or client using the affected libraries3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS* TMW Library: IEC 61850\t+ Any client or server using the C language library with a version number of 11\\.2\\.0 or earlier.\t+ Any client or server using the C\\+\\+, C\\#, or Java language library with a version number of 5\\.0\\.1 or earlier.* TMW Library: IEC 60870\\-6 (ICCP/Tase.2\\)\t+ Any client or server using a C\\+\\+ language library with a version number of 4\\.4\\.3 or earlier.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE\\-824](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html) The TMW IEC 61850 Library and TMW 60870\\-6 (ICCP/TASE.2\\) Library are vulnerable to access given to a small number of uninitialized pointers within their code. This could allow an attacker to target any client or server using the affected libraries to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-38138](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-38138)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy, Water, and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Vera Mens of Claroty Research reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Triangle Microworks encourages those using the affected library to contact [Triangle Microworks Support](mailto:support@trianglemicroworks.com)  for mitigation guidance and strategies. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
