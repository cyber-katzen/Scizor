Additional information may be found in a statement from the State Department. For more information on Russian malicious cyber activity, refer to cisa.gov/uscert/russia.\nActions to Take Today:\u2022 Use secure methods for authentication.\u2022 Enforce principle of least privilege.\u2022 Review trust relationships.\u2022 Implement encryption.\u2022 Ensure robust patching and system configuration audits.\u2022 Monitor logs for suspicious activity.\u2022 Ensure incident response, resilience, and continuity of operations plans are in place.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are aware of possible threats to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks. Successful intrusions into SATCOM networks could create risk in SATCOM network providers\u2019 customer environments.\nGiven the current geopolitical situation, CISA\u2019s Shields Up initiative requests that all organizations significantly lower their threshold for reporting and sharing indications of malicious cyber activity. To that end, CISA and FBI will update this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) as new information becomes available so that SATCOM providers and their customers can take additional mitigation steps pertinent to their environments.\nCISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that are either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the mitigations outlined in this CSA to strengthen SATCOM network cybersecurity.\nClick here\u00a0for a PDF version of this report.\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that are either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the following mitigations:\nMitigations for SATCOM Network Providers\n\nPut in place additional monitoring at ingress and egress points to SATCOM equipment to look for anomalous traffic, such as:\n\nThe presence of insecure remote access tools\u2014such as Teletype Network Protocol (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), and Virtual Network Computing (VNC)\u2014facilitating communications to and from SATCOM terminals.\nNetwork traffic from SATCOM networks to other unexpected network segments.\nUnauthorized use of local or backup accounts within SATCOM networks.\nUnexpected SATCOM terminal to SATCOM terminal traffic.\nNetwork traffic from the internet to closed group SATCOM networks.\nBrute force login attempts over SATCOM network segments.\n\n\nSee the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, February 2022 for specific state-sponsored cyber threat activity relating to SATCOM networks.\n\nMitigations for SATCOM Network Providers and Customers\n\nUse secure methods for authentication, including multifactor authentication where possible, for all accounts used to access, manage, and/or administer SATCOM networks.\u00a0\n\nUse and enforce strong, complex passwords: Review password policies to ensure they align with the latest NIST guidelines.\u00a0\nDo not use default credentials or weak passwords.\nAudit accounts and credentials: remove terminated or unnecessary accounts; change expired credentials.\n\n\nEnforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies. Minimize unnecessary privileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to individual personnel accounts, as well as those assigned to non-personnel accounts (e.g., those assigned to software or systems). Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and regularly audited against usage patterns.\nReview trust relationships. Review existing trust relationships with IT service providers. Threat actors are known to exploit trust relationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and data. \u00a0\n\nRemove unnecessary trust relationships.\u00a0\nReview contractual relationships with all service providers. Ensure contracts include appropriate provisions addressing security, such as those listed below, and that these provisions are appropriately leveraged:\u00a0\n\nSecurity controls the customer deems appropriate.\u00a0\nProvider should have in place appropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems.\nCustomer should have in place appropriate monitoring of the service provider\u2019s presence, activities, and connections to the customer network.\nNotification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the provider\u2019s infrastructure and administrative networks.\n\n\n\n\nImplement independent encryption across all communications links leased from, or provided by, your SATCOM provider. See National Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity Advisory: Protecting VSAT Communications for guidance.\nStrengthen the security of operating systems, software, and firmware.\n\nEnsure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place and, after testing, immediately patch known exploited vulnerabilities included in CISA's living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities carry significant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities.\u00a0\nImplement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and mitigate emerging threats. Regularly audit system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses.\n\n\nMonitor network logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized or unusual login attempts.\n\nIntegrate SATCOM traffic into existing network security monitoring tools.\nReview logs of systems behind SATCOM terminals for suspicious activity.\nIngest system and network generated logs into your enterprise security information and event management (SIEM) tool.\u00a0\nImplement endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools where possible on devices behind SATCOM terminals, and ingest into the SIEM.\nExpand and enhance monitoring of network segments and assets that use SATCOM.\nExpand monitoring to include ingress and egress traffic transiting SATCOM links and monitor for suspicious or anomalous network activity.\u00a0\nBaseline SATCOM network traffic to determine what is normal and investigate deviations, such as large spikes in traffic.\n\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response plan, resilience plan, and continuity of operations plan so that critical functions and operations can be kept running if technology systems\u2014including SATCOM networks\u2014are disrupted or need to be taken offline.\n\n\nContact Information\n\nOrganizations can also report anomalous cyber activity and/or cyber incidents 24/7 to\u00a0report@cisa.gov\u00a0or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472) and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\nResources\n\nNational Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity Advisory: Protecting VSAT Communications\u00a0\nNSA Cybersecurity Technical Report: Network Infrastructure Security Guidance\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI): Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, February 2022\nCISA Tip: Choosing and Protecting Passwords\u00a0\nCISA Capacity Enhancement Guide: Implementing Strong Authentication\n\n\nRevisions\n\nMarch 17, 2022: Initial Version |May 10, 2022: Added Atrribution\n",
