[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryBD Synapsys=========== Last Revised May 31, 2022 Alert Code ICSMA\\-22\\-151\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.7*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)* **Equipment:**  Synapsys* **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient Session Expiration2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive information. This includes electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII).3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of BD Synapsys, a microbiology informatics software platform, are affected:* BD Synapsys: Versions 4\\.20, 4\\.20 SR1 and 4\\.30### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATION CWE\\-613](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html) The affected product is vulnerable due to an insufficient session expiration. An unauthorized physical breach of a BD Synapsys workstation would be negligible due to the sequence of events that must occur in a specific order, however successful exploitation could lead to modification of ePHI, PHI, or PII. The result could cause delayed or incorrect treatment.[CVE\\-2022\\-30277](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30277)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER BD voluntarily reported this vulnerability through the CISA coordinated vulnerability disclosure program.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- BD Synapsys v4\\.20 SR2 will be released in June 2022 and will remediate this vulnerability. Users receiving BD Synapsys v4\\.30 will be allowed to upgrade to v5\\.10, which is expected to be available by August 2022\\. Additionally, BD recommends the following compensating controls for users working with the impacted versions of BD Synapsys:* Configure the inactivity session timeout in the operating system to match the session expiration timeout in BD Synapsys.* Ensure physical access controls are in place and only authorized end\\-users have access to BD Synapsys workstations.* Place a reminder at each computer for users to save all work, logout, or lock their workstation when leaving the BD Synapsys workstation.* Ensure industry standard network security policies and procedures are followed. For more information on this issue, please see the associated [BD product security bulletin](https://cybersecurity.bd.com/bulletins-and-patches/bd-synapsys-insufficient-session-expiration)  on the BD website.
