EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 4\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Hamilton Medical AG* **Equipment:**  Hamilton\\-T1* **Vulnerabilities:**  Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials, Missing XML Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers with physical access to the device to obtain sensitive information or crash the device being accessed.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of the Hamilton\\-T1 Ventilator, are affected:* T1 Ventilator Versions 2\\.2\\.3 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) Hard\\-Coded credentials in the ventilator allow attackers with physical access to obtain admin privileges for the device\u2019s configuration interface.[CVE\\-2020\\-27278](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27278)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [MISSING XML VALIDATION CWE\\-112](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/112.html) An XML validation vulnerability in the ventilator allows privileged attackers with physical access to render the device persistently unusable by uploading specially crafted configuration files.[CVE\\-2020\\-27282](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27282)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE\\-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) An information disclosure vulnerability in the ventilator allows attackers with physical access to the configuration interface's logs to get valid checksums for tampered configuration files.[CVE\\-2020\\-27290](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27290)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Julian Suleder, Raphael Pavlidis, and Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH and Dr. Oliver Matula of ERNW Enno Rey Netzwerke GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI, Germany), in the context of the BSI project ManiMed \u2013 Manipulation of Medical Devices. BSI then provided this report to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hamilton Medical recommends users of affected versions update to a version later than T1 Ventilator Version 2\\.2\\.3 where possible. Additionally, Hamilton Medical recommends users:* Maintain tight physical control of the ventilator.* Be attentive to notifications, alarms, and alerts.* Do not connect to any third\\-party devices or use any unauthorized software. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
