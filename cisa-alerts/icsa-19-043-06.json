EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: CP1604 and CP1616\nVulnerabilities: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Cross-site Scripting, Cross-site Request Forgery\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the updated advisory titled ICSA-19-043-06 Siemens CP1604 and CP1616 that was published February 12, 2019, on the former ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a denial-of-service condition and information exposure. An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript in a specially crafted URL request to execute on unsuspecting user\u2019s systems, allowing an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface that a legitimate user is allowed to perform.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the following CP products are affected:\u00a0\n\nCP 1604 and 1616: All versions prior to v2.8\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nAn attacker with network access to Port 23/TCP could extract internal communication data or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n\nCVE-2018-13808 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe integrated web server of the affected CP devices could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into following a malicious link.\n\nCVE-2018-13809 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\nThe integrated configuration web server of the affected CP devices could allow a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link.\n\nCVE-2018-13810 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture,\n\tWater and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to version 2.8.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\u00a0\n\nDisable the integrated web server. The web server is disabled in the default settings and its use is optional. Use in a productive environment is discouraged.\nRestrict access to the device to the internal or VPN network. Further restrict access to the web interface (80/TCP) and to the telnet port (23/TCP) to trusted IP addresses if possible.\nDo not click on links from unknown sources.\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\nFixes for CVE-2018-13808 have also been released in versions v2.5.2.7, v2.6.2.2, and v2.7.2.1.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-559174 on their website:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
