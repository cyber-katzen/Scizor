GE has produced a new firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability in the USB version of the GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M monitoring system.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCT\nThe following GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M firmware versions are affected:\n\nGE Bently Nevada 3500/22M (USB version), all versions prior to firmware Version 5.0, and\nGE Bently Nevada 3500/22M (serial version), all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of the identified vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected device with elevated privileges.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGE Bently Nevada is a wholly owned subsidiary of GE, a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected product, GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M, is a vibration monitoring system. According to GE, the GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M is deployed across several sectors including Chemical and Energy. GE estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER AUTHORIZATIONCWE-285: Improper Authorization, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html, web site last accessed October 06, 2016.\n\nSeveral open ports have been identified on the affected device, which allow unauthorized access to the device with elevated privileges.\nCVE-2016-5788NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5788, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed October 06, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE has released a new firmware version for the GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M TDI USB monitoring system, Version 5.0. GE\u2019s new firmware can only be applied to the USB version of the GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M monitoring system. Users registered with a GE Bently Nevada Technical Support Agreement can download Version 5.0 and access GE\u2019s Technical Information Letter (TIL-149700250) detailing further mitigation strategies at the following URL with a valid account:\nhttp://www.bntechsupport.com\nGE recommends that users using the serial version of the GE Bently Nevada 3500/22M upgrade the affected device.\nUsers who are concerned about the security of their GE Bently Nevada 3500 System should:\n\nEmploy system hardening techniques for GE Bently Nevada\u2019s 3500 System as outlined in document 106M9733 - 3500 Hardening Guideline. This document is available through www.bntechsupport.com.\nContact GE Bently Nevada for information regarding installations compliant to IEC 62443-2-4 Level 1.\nImplement a bump-in-the-wire solution to provide secure communication between endpoints, which may enhance security.\nEffectively segment networks and implement demilitarized zones (DMZs) with properly configured firewalls to selectively control and monitor traffic passed between zones.\n\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
