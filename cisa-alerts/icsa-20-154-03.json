MITIGATIONS--------------- ABB recommends changing any user account passwords suspected to be known by an unauthorized person. ABB recommends users disable interactive logon (both local and remote) for the service account. Please note these vulnerabilities can only be exploited by authenticated users. ABB recommendeds users ensure only authorized persons have access to user accounts in System 800xA. ABB plans to correct these vulnerabilities in future product versions. For more information, please refer to [ABB\u2019s Cybersecurity Advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2PAA121236&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Follow the principle of least privilege. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
