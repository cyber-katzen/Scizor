Public exploits are available.**Vendor:**  Dahua Technology Co., Ltd**Equipment:**  Digital Video Recorders and IP Cameras**Vulnerabilities:**  Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication, Password in Configuration FileAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Dahua Technology Co., Ltd (Dahua) network cameras are affected:* DH\\-IPC\\-HDBW23A0RN\\-ZS,* DH\\-IPC\\-HDBW13A0SN,* DH\\-IPC\\-HDW1XXX,* DH\\-IPC\\-HDW2XXX,* DH\\-IPC\\-HDW4XXX,* DH\\-IPC\\-HFW1XXX,* DH\\-IPC\\-HFW2XXX,* DH\\-IPC\\-HFW4XXX,* DH\\-SD6CXX,* DH\\-NVR1XXX,* DH\\-HCVR4XXX, and* DH\\-HCVR5XXX. The following Dahua Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) are affected:* DHI\\-HCVR51A04HE\\-S3,* DHI\\-HCVR51A08HE\\-S3, and* DHI\\-HCVR58A32S\\-S2\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to obtain user credentials, including password hashes, and use these credentials to bypass authentication.MITIGATION---------- Dahua has released updated firmware to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Updated software can be obtained from Dahua technical support or an authorized Dahua distributor. In addition, Dahua released the following security notifications for users:* [Cyber Vulnerability Affecting Certain Dahua IP Cameras and Recorders (March 6\\)](http://us.dahuasecurity.com/en/us/Security-Bulletin_030617.php)* [Cybersecurity Statement \u2013 March 6, 2017](http://www.dahuasecurity.com/en/us/single.php?nid=354)* [Cybersecurity Vulnerability Update \u2013 March 8, 2017](http://www.dahuasecurity.com/en/us/single.php?nid=364)* [Cyber Vulnerability Affecting Certain Dahua IP Cameras and Recorders (April 3\\)](http://us.dahuasecurity.com/en/us/Security-Bulletin_04032017.php) Dahua\u2019s original notification specifies 11 affected models, but after initial testing, Dahua has identified additional series and models in the following security notification:* [Security Notification DHCC\\-201703\\-01](http://www1.dahuasecurity.com/annoucementsingle/security-notification-dhcc-201703-01-112.html) NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Change default passwords immediately.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[USE OF PASSWORD HASH INSTEAD OF PASSWORD FOR AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-836](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/836.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The use of password hash instead of password for authentication vulnerability was identified, which could allow a malicious user to bypass authentication without obtaining the actual password.[CVE\\-2017\\-7927](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-7927)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
