  "markdown": "\nOverview\nICS-CERT has received a report from Siemens regarding a buffer overflow vulnerability in the web interface of the Scalance X Industrial Ethernet switch. This vulnerability was reported to Siemens by J\u00fcrgen Bilberger from Daimler TSS GmbH.\nThis vulnerability leaves the affected devices susceptible to a remote denial of service attack. Siemens has published a firmware update that addresses this vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nThe following Scalance X products affected by this vulnerability:\n\nScalance X414-3E\nScalance X308-2M\nScalance X-300EEC\nScalance XR-300\nScalance X-300\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of the reported vulnerability allows an attacker to perform malicious actions which may lead to a denial of service condition or possible arbitrary code execution. These actions may ultimately impact the process environment in which the system is deployed.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nScalance X Industrial Ethernet switches are industrial grade Ethernet switches used to connect industrial components. This product line provides a web interface to manage controller configuration. Scalance X is used in the Agriculture and Food, Critical Manufacturing, Government Facilities, Dams, Transportation Systems, Water, Chemical, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, and Communications sectors.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nBuffer Overflowhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, website last accessed April 11, 2012.\nThe embedded web server does not properly sanitize URLs in HTTP requests. If an attacker requests a malformed URL from the web server, a vulnerable Scalance X switch reboots, inhibits further data transmission to the switch, and may allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2012-1802 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Siemens has assigned a CVSS V2 base score of 7.8.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a moderate skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nSiemens has produced firmware updates that resolve this vulnerability for the listed hardware platforms. Siemens strongly recommends installing the updates as soon as possible. Download the appropriate update from the following links:\n\nFirmware Update Location (Scalance X414-3E)\nFirmware Update Location (Scalance X308-2M, X-300EEC, XR-300, X-300)\nan overview over the Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security (with the cell protection concept)\nInformation about industrial security by Siemens\nRecommended security practices by US-CERT\nFor further inquiries on vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens Product CERT\n\nThe Siemens Security Advisory is available at http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-130874.pdf.\nIn addition to applying the update provided by Siemens, ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
