MITIGATIONS--------------- ETIC Telecom recommends updating the firmware of the affected devices to the following versions:**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * ETIC Telecom RAS: [version 4\\.7\\.0 or later](https://www.etictelecom.com/en/softwares-download/) For the installed devices, ETIC Telecom recommends:* CVE\\-2022\\-3703: For all firmware versions 4\\.7\\.0 and above, there is a code signature verification for firmware packages. For versions prior to 4\\.7\\.0, to reduce the attack surface, we advise the user to verify: (1\\) That the downloaded firmware comes from a trusted source (ETIC Telecom web site), and (2\\) The hash of the firmware files.* CVE\\-2022\\-41607: This issue has been fixed in version 4\\.7\\.0\\. For versions prior to 4\\.7\\.0, to reduce the attack surface, we advise the user to verify in the router configuration that: (1\\) The administration web page is accessible only through the LAN side over HTTPS, and (2\\) The administration web page is protected with authentication.* CVE\\-2022\\-40981: For all firmware versions 4\\.7\\.0 and above, only valid configuration files can be uploaded to the device. For versions prior to 4\\.7\\.0, to reduce the attack surface, we advise the user to verify in the router configuration that: (1\\) The administration web page is accessible only through the LAN side over HTTPS, and (2\\) The administration web page is protected with authentication.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
