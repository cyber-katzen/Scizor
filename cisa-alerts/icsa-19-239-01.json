RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker on the same network to gain complete control of the device\u2019s operating system and allow remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Delta Controls enteliBUS Controllers, industrial control systems, are affected:* enteliBUS Manager firmware Versions 3\\.40 R5 build 571848 and prior* enteliBUS Manager Touch (eBMGR\\-TCH) firmware Versions 3\\.40 R5 build 571848 and prior* enteliBUS Controller (eBCON) firmware Versions 3\\.40 R5 build 571848 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html) The affected products are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition due to the lack of input validation, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2019\\-9569](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-9569)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Canada### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Douglas McKee @fulmetalpackets and contributing researcher Mark Bereza @ROPsicle of McAfee Advanced Threat Research reported this vulnerability to Delta Controls.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Delta Controls recommends users upgrade from enteliBUS 3\\.40 firmware to Version 3\\.40 R6 build 612850\\. Delta Controls also states it is important buildings are updated to the 3\\.40 R6 release to mitigate risk. The firmware is only accessible by Delta Controls registered partners and is not available for public download. To acquire the firmware update, contact a Delta Controls distributor or Delta Controls directly. In addition to upgrading enteliBUS, Delta Controls recommends the following actions to secure building sites:* Do not leave building controllers exposed to the Internet.\t+ If remote connections to the network are required, use a virtual private network (VPN).\t+ Secure networks using Tempered Networks products (available through Delta Controls).* Regularly review and validate the list of users authorized to access sites and controllers.* Ensure personnel with access to the system are knowledgeable about and are trained to use Delta Controls products and networks.* Follow [security industry recommended practices for securing sites](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/Introduction-Recommended-Practices)  .
