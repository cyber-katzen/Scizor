  "markdown": "\nOverview\nIndependent researcher Luigi Auriemma has identified a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Certec EDV GmbH atvise application. Certec has produced an update that resolves this vulnerability. Mr. Auriemma validated that the update resolves the vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nAtvise versions older than Version 2.1 are affected.\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to cause a DoS.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nCertec EDV GmbH is an Austrian-based company.\nThe affected product, atvise, is web-based human-machine interface supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI SCADA) systems. According to Certec, atvise is deployed in every field of industrial automation. Certec states that these products are used worldwide.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to Port 4840/TCP.\nCVE-2011-4873 has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploits are known to target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill level can create the DoS.\nMitigation\nCertec has developed a new version of atvise that prevents this DoS. Customers can download the new version of Atvise.\nCertc and ICS-CERT recommend that owners of vulnerable versions of the atvise product download and install the updated version as soon as possible.\nICS-CERT also encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
