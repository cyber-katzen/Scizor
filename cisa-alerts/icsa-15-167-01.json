GarrettCom has produced new firmware versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Ashish Kamble has tested the newest version to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities he reported.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GarrettCom products are affected:\n\nMagnum 6K product line, all versions prior to 4.5.6, and\nMagnum 10K product line, all versions prior to 4.5.6.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities may be able to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target device or cause the device to reboot.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGarrettCom is a US-based company that maintains offices also in Europe.\nThe Magnum MNS-6K Management Software provides device management for the Magnum 6K line of managed Ethernet switches. According to GarrettCom, the 6K line of switches are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems. GarrettCom estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States with a small percentage in Europe and Asia, though they are available worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, web site last accessed June 16, 2015.\n\nMultiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in the web server present on the device, which can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.\nCVE-2015-3942NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3942 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Version 4.5.5 was released December 2014, and Version 4.5.6 was released January 2015. Users may download the latest software version and release notes from the following web site:\nhttp://www.garrettcom.com/techsupport/sw_downloads.htm\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nPerform access control checks to limit which users can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\nUse an application firewall that can detect XSS attacks. It can be helpful when the code cannot be fixed, as an emergency prevention measure, or to provide defense in depth.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
