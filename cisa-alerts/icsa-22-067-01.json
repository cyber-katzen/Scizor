A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') \u00a0CWE-22\nThe affected product (disregarding Axeda agent v6.9.2 and v6.9.3) is vulnerable to directory traversal, which could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain file system read access via web server.\nCVE-2022-25249 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected product may allow an attacker to send a certain command to a specific port without authentication. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to shut down a specific service.\nCVE-2022-25250 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected product may allow an attacker to send certain XML messages to a specific port without proper authentication. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to read and modify the affected product\u2019s configuration.\nCVE-2022-25251 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 IMPROPER CHECK OR HANDLING OF EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE-703\nThe affected product when receiving certain input throws an exception. Services using said function do not handle the exception. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to crash the affected product.\nCVE-2022-25252 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nYuval Shoshani and Elad Luz of CyberMDX and Vedere Labs reported these vulnerabilities to PTC\n5. MITIGATIONS\nPTC recommends the following:\n\nUpgrade to Axeda agent Version 6.9.2 build 1049 or 6.9.3 build 1051 when running older versions of the Axeda agent.\nConfigure Axeda agent and Axeda Desktop Server (ADS) to only listen on the local host interface 127.0.0.1. Refer to PTC knowledge article CS360255\nProvide a unique password in the AxedaDesktop.ini file for each unit.\nNever use ERemoteServer in production.\nMake sure to delete ERemoteServer file from host device.\nRemove the installation file, for example: Gateway_vs2017-en-us-x64-pc-winnt-vc14-6.9.3-1051.msi\nWhen running in Windows or Linux, only allow connections to ERemoteServer from trusted hosts and block all others.\nWhen running the Windows operating system, configure Localhost communications (127.0.0.1) between ERemoteServer and Axeda Builder. Refer to PTC knowledge article CS360255\nConfigure the Axeda agent for the authentication information required to log in to the Axeda Deployment Utility. Refer to PTC knowledge article CS360255\n\nPTC recommends upgrading the Axeda Desktop Server (ADS) to Version 6.9 build 215\nThe Axeda agent loopback-only configuration is only available in Version 6.9.1 and above. Hence, upgrading to Axeda agent 6.9.1 or above is required.\nFor more information refer to PTC Security Advisory and Resolution and Axeda Public Advisory.\nSee the following links for more information on products that may be dependent on the affected Axeda agent and Axeda Desktop Server:\n\nAccuray\nAgilent\nBD\nBayer\nBeckman Coulter\nElekta (Login Required)\nGeneral Electric\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\nHologic\n\n--------- End Update C Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\n\n\nRoche Diagnostics\nSmiths Medical\nVarian\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
