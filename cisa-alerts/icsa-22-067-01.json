MITIGATIONS--------------- PTC recommends the following:* Upgrade to Axeda agent Version 6\\.9\\.2 build 1049 or 6\\.9\\.3 build 1051 when running older versions of the Axeda agent.* Configure Axeda agent and Axeda Desktop Server (ADS) to only listen on the local host interface 127\\.0\\.0\\.1\\. Refer to PTC knowledge article [CS360255](https://www.ptc.com/en/support/article/CS360255)* Provide a unique password in the AxedaDesktop.ini file for each unit.* Never use ERemoteServer in production.* Make sure to delete ERemoteServer file from host device.* Remove the installation file, for example: Gateway\\_vs2017\\-en\\-us\\-x64\\-pc\\-winnt\\-vc14\\-6\\.9\\.3\\-1051\\.msi* When running in Windows or Linux, only allow connections to ERemoteServer from trusted hosts and block all others.* When running the Windows operating system, configure Localhost communications (127\\.0\\.0\\.1\\) between ERemoteServer and Axeda Builder. Refer to PTC knowledge article [CS360255](https://www.ptc.com/en/support/article/CS360255)* Configure the Axeda agent for the authentication information required to log in to the Axeda Deployment Utility. Refer to PTC knowledge article [CS360255](https://www.ptc.com/en/support/article/CS360255) PTC recommends upgrading the Axeda Desktop Server (ADS) to [Version 6\\.9 build 215](https://www.ptc.com/en/support/refdoc/Axeda_Connectivity/6.9/Axeda_Desktop_Server_Viewer_Release_Notes_v69_174653?&art_lang=en&posno=1&q=Desktop%20Server&DocumentType=Reference%20Document&source=search)  The Axeda agent loopback\\-only configuration is only available in Version 6\\.9\\.1 and above. Hence, upgrading to [Axeda agent 6\\.9\\.1 or above](https://www.ptc.com/en/support/refdoc/Axeda_Connectivity/6.9.3/Axeda_Gateway_Agent_Release_Notes_v6_9_3?&art_lang=en&posno=10&q=Axeda%20Gateway%20Agent%20Release%20Notes&source=search)  is required.

Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
