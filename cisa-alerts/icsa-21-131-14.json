UPDATE INFORMATION\n----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-21\\-131\\-14 Siemens SCALANCE W1750D\u00a0(Update A) that was published August 10, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, fully compromise the underlying operating system, overwrite sensitive system files, create a denial\\-of\\-service condition, execute arbitrary script code in a victim\u2019s browser, read arbitrary files off the underlying file system, create an attacker named directory, corrupt backup files, or obtain sensitive information.\n \n\n\n4\\.

In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) \n and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n For additional information see Siemens Security Advisory\n [SSA\\-723417](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-723417.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n .
