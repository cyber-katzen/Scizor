MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has provided the following updates to address the vulnerabilities in the affected products:* RUGGEDCOM ROX II for RX1400 with WLAN interface: Install v2\\.11\\.2: Contact the RUGGEDCOM support team at:[https://support.industry.siemens.com/my/WW/en/requests\\#createRequest](https://support.industry.siemens.com/my/WW/en/requests#createRequest) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update E Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE W\\-700 (IEEE 802\\.11n): Install v6\\.2\\.1 or newer https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/ps/21965/dl**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update E Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE W\\-700 (IEEE 802\\.11n): Install v6\\.2\\.1:<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109752596>* SCALANCE W1750D: Install v6\\.5\\.1\\.5\\-4\\.3\\.1\\.8:<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109756771>* SCALANCE WLC711 and SCALANCE WLC712: Install v9\\.21\\.19\\.003:<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109755170>* SIMATIC RF350M and SIMATIC RF650M: update to v22\\.3\\.5\\.16:<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109752556> SCALANCE W1750D devices are not vulnerable in the default configuration. Only users who enable the \u201cMesh\u201d or \u201cWiFi uplink\u201d functionality are affected by the vulnerabilities. Disabling these functionalities will completely mitigate the vulnerabilities. SCALANCE WLC711 and WLC712 can deactivate IEEE 802\\.11r, \u201cMeshConnect,\u201d and \u201cClient Bridge Mode\u201d to reduce the risk, provided these modes have been activated and are not required for the operation of the wireless environment. All three functions are turned off by default. SCALANCE W\\-700 standalone Access Points, RUGGEDCOM RX1400 and RS9xxW, are not vulnerable if operated in Access Point mode. SCALANCE W\\-700 standalone devices, SIMATIC Mobile Panel 277F IWLAN, and SIMATIC ET200 WLAN, are not affected if the iPCF, iPCF\\-MC, or iPCF\\-HT features are enabled. For the remaining affected products or if the mitigations outlined previously cannot be implemented, Siemens recommends the following mitigations in the meantime:* Ensure multiple layers of security. Do not depend on the security of WPA2 alone.* Use WPA2\\-CCMP (AES) instead of WPA2\\-TKIP or WPA\\-GCMP, if supported by the WLAN clients, to reduce the risk of potential attacks.* Apply defense\\-in\\-depth.[https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisories SSA\\-901333 and SSA\\-418456 at the following location:[http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert\\-security\\-advisories.htm](http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm)  NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site.](/ics/)  Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
