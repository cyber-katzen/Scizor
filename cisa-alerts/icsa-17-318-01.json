MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has provided the following updates to address the vulnerabilities in the affected products:\n\nRUGGEDCOM ROX II for RX1400 with WLAN interface: Install v2.11.2:\n\nContact the RUGGEDCOM support team at:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/my/WW/en/requests#createRequest\n--------- Begin Update E Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSCALANCE W-700 (IEEE 802.11n): Install v6.2.1 or newer\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/ps/21965/dl\u00a0\n--------- End Update E Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSCALANCE W-700 (IEEE 802.11n): Install v6.2.1:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109752596\n\nSCALANCE W1750D: Install v6.5.1.5-4.3.1.8:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109756771\n\nSCALANCE WLC711 and SCALANCE WLC712: Install v9.21.19.003:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109755170\n\nSIMATIC RF350M and SIMATIC RF650M: update to v22.3.5.16:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109752556\nSCALANCE W1750D devices are not vulnerable in the default configuration. Only users who enable the \u201cMesh\u201d or \u201cWiFi uplink\u201d functionality are affected by the vulnerabilities. Disabling these functionalities will completely mitigate the vulnerabilities.\nSCALANCE WLC711 and WLC712 can deactivate IEEE 802.11r, \u201cMeshConnect,\u201d and \u201cClient Bridge Mode\u201d to reduce the risk, provided these modes have been activated and are not required for the operation of the wireless environment. All three functions are turned off by default.\nSCALANCE W-700 standalone Access Points, RUGGEDCOM RX1400 and RS9xxW, are not vulnerable if operated in Access Point mode.\nSCALANCE W-700 standalone devices, SIMATIC Mobile Panel 277F IWLAN, and SIMATIC ET200 WLAN, are not affected if the iPCF, iPCF-MC, or iPCF-HT features are enabled.\nFor the remaining affected products or if the mitigations outlined previously cannot be implemented, Siemens recommends the following mitigations in the meantime:\n\nEnsure multiple layers of security. Do not depend on the security of WPA2 alone.\nUse WPA2-CCMP (AES) instead of WPA2-TKIP or WPA-GCMP, if supported by the WLAN clients, to reduce the risk of potential attacks.\nApply defense-in-depth.\n\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisories SSA-901333 and SSA-418456 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThese vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. These vulnerabilities are exploitable from an adjacent network. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
