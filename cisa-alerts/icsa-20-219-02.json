EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: WebAccess HMI Designer\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Read, Out-of-bounds Write, Type Confusion, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Double Free\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Advantech WebAccess HMI Designer, a Human Machine Interface (HMI) runtime development software, are affected:\n\nWebAccess HMI Designer Versions 2.1.9.31 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited by opening specially crafted project files that may overflow the heap, which may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-16207 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, which may allow an attacker to read information.\nCVE-2020-16211 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nProcessing specially crafted project files lacking proper validation of user supplied data may cause the system to write outside the intended buffer area, which may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2020-16213 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843\nProcessing specially crafted project files lacking proper validation of user supplied data may cause a type confusion condition, which may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2020-16229 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nProcessing specially crafted project files lacking proper validation of user supplied data may cause a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2020-16215 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DOUBLE FREE CWE-415\nA double free vulnerability caused by processing specially crafted project files may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2020-16217 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: East Asia, Europe, United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya and Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech has released Version 2.1.9.81 of WebAccess HMI Designer to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccess HMI Designer.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
