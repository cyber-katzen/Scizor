MITIGATIONS--------------- Users of the affected products and versions may take measures through mitigations and workarounds. Mitsubishi Electric has released the fixed versions for CVE\\-2021\\-20594 and CVE\\-2021\\-20597 as shown below, but updating the product to the fixed version is not available.* MELSEC iQ\\-R series Safety CPU R08/16/32/120SFCPU:Firmware versions \"27\" or later* MELSEC iQ\\-R series SIL2 Process CPU R08/16/32/120PSFCPU:Firmware versions \"12\" or later Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:* Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.* Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Use the IP filter function to restrict the accessible IP addresses. [MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application) 1\\.13 Security \"IP filter\"](https://www.mitsubishifa.co.th/files/dl/plc/sh081257eng/sh081257engs.pdf)* Register user information or change the password via USB. If you have already registered user information or changed the user's password via the network, change the password once via USB. This mitigation is applicable to [CVE\\-2021\\-20597](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20597) Additional information about these vulnerabilities or Mitsubishi Electric's compensating control is available by [contacting a Mitsubishi Electric representative.](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/support/index.html)  Users should refer to Mitsubishi Electric advisories [2021\\-008,](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-008_en.pdf) [2021\\-009,](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-009_en.pdf)  and [2021\\-010](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-010_en.pdf)  for further details. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
