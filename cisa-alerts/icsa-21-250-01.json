MITIGATIONS\nUsers of the affected products and versions may take measures through mitigations and workarounds. Mitsubishi Electric has released the fixed versions for CVE-2021-20594 and CVE-2021-20597 as shown below, but updating the product to the fixed version is not available.\n\nMELSEC iQ-R series Safety CPU R08/16/32/120SFCPU:Firmware versions \"27\" or later\nMELSEC iQ-R series SIL2 Process CPU R08/16/32/120PSFCPU:Firmware versions \"12\" or later\n\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:\n\nUse a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\nUse the IP filter function to restrict the accessible IP addresses. MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application) 1.13 Security \"IP filter\"\nRegister user information or change the password via USB. If you have already registered user information or changed the user's password via the network, change the password once via USB. This mitigation is applicable to CVE-2021-20597\n\nAdditional information about these vulnerabilities or Mitsubishi Electric's compensating control is available by contacting a Mitsubishi Electric representative.\nUsers should refer to Mitsubishi Electric advisories 2021-008, 2021-009, and 2021-010 for further details.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
