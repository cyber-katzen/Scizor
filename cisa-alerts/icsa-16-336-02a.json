Moxa has produced new firmware versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nMoxa reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of NPort:\n\nNPort 5110 versions prior to 2.7,\nNPort 5130/5150 Series versions prior to 3.7,\nNPort 5200 Series versions prior to 2.9,\nNPort 5400 Series versions prior to 3.12,\nNPort 5600 Series versions prior to 3.8,\nNPort 5100A Series & NPort P5150A versions prior to 1.4,\nNPort 5200A Series versions prior to 1.4,\nNPort 5150AI-M12 Series versions prior to 1.3,\nNPort 5250AI-M12 Series versions prior to 1.3,\nNPort 5450AI-M12 Series versions prior to 1.3,\nNPort 5600-8-DT Series versions prior to 2.5,\nNPort 5600-8-DTL Series versions prior to 2.5,\nNPort IA5450A versions prior to v1.4,\nNPort 6000 series versions prior to 1.16, and\nNPort 6110 series all versions\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to the complete compromise of an affected system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMoxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.\nThe affected products, NPort devices, connect serial devices to Ethernet networks. According to Moxa, NPort devices are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCREDENTIALS MANAGEMENTCWE-255: Credentials Management, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html, web site last accessed December 01, 2016.\n\nAdministration passwords can be retried without authenticating.\nCVE-2016-9361NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9361, web site last accessed March 21, 2017. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Moxa recommends that customers using the NPort 6110 should upgrade the affected device.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure that Ports 161/UDP, 4800/UDP, and 4900/TCP are only accessible by trusted systems and that restricting access to Ports 4800/UDP and 4900/TCP will impact remote systems administration.\nEnsure that all unused ports are disabled.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
