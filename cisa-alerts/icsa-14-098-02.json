WellinTech has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following WellinTech KingSCADA products are affected:\n\nKingSCADA, all versions prior to v3.1.2.13\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of the reported vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute remote code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nWellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control. WellinTech is based in Beijing, China, with branches in the United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan.\nThe WellinTech web site describes KingSCADA as a Windows-based control, monitoring, and data collection application deployed across several sectors including Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, Commercial Facilities, and others.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed April 08, 2014.\n\nThe KingSCADA application has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability where the application overwrites the structured exception handler (SEH). An attacker could send a specially crafted packet to KingSCADA, and the application would handle the packet incorrectly, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the currently running user, which would affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nCVE-2014-0787NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0787, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed April 08, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nWellinTech has created a patch and instructions for installation that are available for download on its web site at:\nhttp://www.wellintech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=11\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
