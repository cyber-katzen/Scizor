Only affected by CVE-2018-4839\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to upload a modified device configuration, allowing an overwrite of access authorization passwords.\nCVE-2018-4840 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with local access to the engineering system or in a privileged network position to capture certain network traffic, and possibly reconstruct access authorization passwords.\nCVE-2018-4839 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nIlya Karpov and Dmitry Sklyarov from Positive Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has provided the following updates for mitigations:\n\nDIGSI 4:\u00a0 Update to v4.92.\nEN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant:\u00a0 Update to v4.30.\n\n--------- Begin Update D Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nEN100 Ethernet module DNP3 variant: Update to v4.30 and configure DIGSI 4 connection password.\n\n--------- End Update D Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nSIPROTEC Compact 7SJ80:\u00a0 Update to v4.77.\nSIPROTEC Compact 7SK80: Update to v4.77.\nSIPROTEC 4 7SJ61, 7SJ62, and 7SJ64: Update to v4.96.\nSIPROTEC 4 7SJ66:\u00a0 Update to v4.30.\nSIPROTEC 4 7SD80:\u00a0 Update to v4.70.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nRecommended security guidelines to secure substations and defense in depth can be found at:\u00a0 https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-203306\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
