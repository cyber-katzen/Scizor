The issue also exists for source libraries, but 3S\\-Smart Software Solutions GmbH strongly recommends distributing compiled libraries only.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2019\\-13538](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13538) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Critical Manufacturing\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Germany\n\n\n### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Heinz F\u00fcglister of WRH Walter Reist Holding AG reported this vulnerability to 3S\\-Smart Software Solutions GmbH.\n \n\n\n5\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n 3S\\-Smart Software Solutions GmbH continued investigating the issue after Version 3\\.5\\.15\\.0 was released as an initial mitigation. They have released version 3\\.5\\.16\\.0 as a more complete resolution for this vulnerability in all affected CODESYS products.\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Please visit the CODESYS update page\u00a0for more information on how to obtain the software update:\n <https://www.codesys.com/download/>\n\n\n\n\n As part of a security strategy, 3S\\-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:\n \n\n\n* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside.\n* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks.\n* Use VPN (virtual private networks) tunnels if remote access is required.\n* Activate and apply user management and password features.\n* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.\n* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions.
