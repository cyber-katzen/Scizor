MITIGATIONS--------------- Baxter recommends ensuring appropriate physical controls within user environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices. Baxter recommends isolating the Spectrum Infusion Systems to its own network VLAN to segregate the system from other hospital systems, and reduce the probability that a threat actor could execute an adjacent attack such as a MiTM attack against the system to observe clear\\-text communications.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Baxter recommends using the strongest available wireless network security protocols (e.g., WPA2, EAP\\-TLS, etc.) to provide authentication and encryption of wireless data sent to and from the Spectrum Infusion System.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Users should ensure the WBM is rebooted after configuration for their network(s) by removing the WBM from the rear of the Spectrum device for 10\\-15 seconds, and then re\\-attaching the WBM. Users should always monitor for and/or block unexpected traffic, such as FTP, at network boundaries into the Spectrum\\-specific VLAN. As a last resort, users may disable wireless operation of the pump. The Spectrum Infusion System was designed to operate without network access. This action would impact an organization\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy drug library (formulary) updates to their pumps. For additional information please see the [Baxter Product Security Bulletin](https://www.baxter.com/product-security#additionalresources)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
