EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Johnson Controls\nEquipment: Metasys\nVulnerabilities: Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption; Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could be leveraged by an attacker to decrypt captured network traffic.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Metasys building automation system are affected:\n\nMetasys system versions prior to 9.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REUSING A NONCE, KEY PAIR IN ENCRYPTION CWE-323\nMetasys ADS/ADX servers and NAE/NIE/NCE engines make use of a shared RSA key pair for certain encryption operations involving the Site Management Portal (SMP). An attacker with access to the shared RSA key pair could decrypt captured network traffic between the Metasys ADS/ADX servers or NAE/NIE/NCE engines and the connecting SMP user client.\nCVE-2019-7593 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nMetasys ADS/ADX servers and NAE/NIE/NCE engines make use of a hardcoded RC2 key for certain encryption operations involving the Site Management Portal (SMP). An attacker with access to the hardcoded RC2 key could decrypt captured network traffic between the Metasys ADS/ADX servers or NAE/NIE/NCE engines and the connecting SMP user client.\nCVE-2019-7594 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nharpocrates.ghost@protonmail.com reported these vulnerabilities to Johnson Controls.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends the following:\n\nUsers should upgrade to Version 9.0 or later and configure sites with trusted certificates.\nFurther ICS security notices and product security guidance are located at the Johnson Controls product security website.\n\nFor questions concerning this product, contact Johnson Controls Global Product Security; email: productsecurity@jci.com.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
