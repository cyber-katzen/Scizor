[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryTrihedral Engineering Limited VTScada===================================== Last Revised October 31, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-164\\-01### **CVSS v3 7\\.5****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Trihedral Engineering Limited**Equipment:**  VTScada**Vulnerability:**  Resource Consumption **,**  Cross\\-Site Scripting, Information ExposureAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of VTScada, an HMI SCADA software, are affected:* VTScada Versions prior to 11\\.2\\.26IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in uncontrolled resource consumption, arbitrary code execution, or information exposure.MITIGATION---------- Trihedral recommends that users of an affected version update to the latest version, v11\\.2\\.26\\. The update can be found at the following location:[ftp://ftp.trihedral.com/VTS/VTScada 11\\.2 Versions/VTScada 11\\.2\\.26\\.zip](ftp://ftp.trihedral.com/VTS/VTScada%2011.2%20Versions/VTScada%2011.2.26.zip)  Help file notes for upgrading VTScada/VTS can be found at:<https://www.trihedral.com/help/Content/Op_Welcome/Wel_UpgradeNotes.htm> NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The client does not properly validate the input or limit the amount of resources that are utilized by an attacker, which can be used to consume more resources than are available.[CVE\\-2017\\-6043](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6043)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
