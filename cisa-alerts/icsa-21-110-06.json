MITIGATIONS--------------- Eaton has patched these security issues and new versions of the affected software are released. The latest versions can be downloaded from the locations below:* Eaton IPM v1\\.69: [Download \\| IPM \\| Eaton](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/catalog/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/eaton-intelligent-power-manager/download-eaton-intelligent-power-manager-ipm.html)* Eaton IPP v1\\.68: [Download software \\| Power management \\| Eaton](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/products/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/software-downloads.html) To prevent the exploitation of the issues and safeguard the software from malicious entities, Eaton recommends blocking Ports 4679 and 4680 at the enterprise network or home network where Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) software is installed and used. Please see Eaton vulnerability advisory number [ETN\\-VA\\-2021\\-1000](https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/company/news-insights/cybersecurity/security-bulletins/eaton-intelligent-power-manager-ipm-vulnerability-advisory.pdf)  for more information. Eaton recommends the following general security best practices:* Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.* Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.* Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need\\-to\\-use basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) updated to the most current version available.* Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.* Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.* Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g., SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.* Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes).* Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or passphrases.* Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
