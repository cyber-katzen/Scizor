MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n According to Wind River, software patches for these vulnerabilities are available for all affected VxWorks versions. Users interested in obtaining these patches should contact Wind River technical support for assistance.\n \n\n\n\n<http://windriver.com/support/>\n\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n GE reports the vulnerabilities do not impact Version 1\\.7 or newer. To upgrade a D20MX to Version 1\\.8, users should follow the upgrade procedures:\n \n\n\n* \"TN0110 D20MX v1\\.8\\+ Upgrade Procedure\" or\n* \"TN0111 D20MX v1\\.8\\+ Upgrade over Serial Procedure\"\n\n\n\n These are available for download from the tech support website:\n [http://sc.ge.com/\\*SASTechSupport](http://sc.ge.com/*SASTechSupport) \n \\> Substation Automation \\> D20MX \\> Firmware v1\\.80 \\> Documentation.\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n NCCIC also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Wind River\n* GE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-13-091-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
