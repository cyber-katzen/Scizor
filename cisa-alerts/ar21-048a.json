Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Treasury (Treasury) to highlight the cyber threat to cryptocurrency posed by North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and provide mitigation recommendations. Working with U.S. government partners, FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess that Lazarus Group\u2014which these agencies attribute to North Korean state\\-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors\u2014is targeting individuals and companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that have been modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency.       This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21\\-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea's Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us\\-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21\\-048A.       There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018\\. In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third\\-party application from a website that appears legitimate.       The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version\u2014Celas Trade Pro\u2014and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations.       In August 2018, open source reporting revealed information about a Trojanized version of a legitimate cryptocurrency trading application on a victim\u2019s computer (Note: identity of the victim was not disclosed). The malicious program, known as Celas Trade Pro, is a modified version of the benign QT Bitcoin Trader application. This incident led to the victim company being infected with the malware known to the U.S. Government as FALLCHILL, a North Korean remote administration tool (RAT). According to CISA, FALLCHILL \u201cis a fully functional RAT with multiple commands that the actors can issue from a command and control (C2\\) server to a victim\u2019s system via dual proxies. FALLCHILL typically infects a system as a file dropped by other HIDDENCOBRA malware. Because of this, additional HIDDENCOBRA malware may be present on systems compromised with FALLCHILL.\"       Celas Trade Pro had been recommended to the victim company via a phishing email from a company known as Celas Limited. The email provided a link to the Celas Limited website (https://www\\[.]celasllc.com), where the user could download a Windows or MacOS version of the Celas Trade Pro software.       For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:  [MAR\\-10322463\\-1\\.v1\\.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10322463-1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)   .

The SSL certificate was \u201cDomain Control Validated,\" which is a weak security verification level for a webserver. Typically, this is a fully automated verification where the certificate requester only needs to demonstrate control over the domain name (i.e. with an email like admin\\[@]celasllc.com). This type of certificate necessitates no validation of the identity of the website\u2019s owner, nor the existence of the actual business. At the time of analysis, the domain celasllc.com resolved to IP address 185\\.142\\.236\\.213, which belongs to the Netherlands Amsterdam Blackhost Ltd ISP, AS174, Cogent Communications.

The OSX program has very similar functionality to the Windows program and also previously had a valid digital signature from Comodo. Again the installer appears to be legitimate, and installs CelasTradePro as well as a program named \u201cUpdater\u201d in the \u201c/Applications/CelasTradePro.app/Contents/MacOS/\u201d folder. The installer contains a postinstall script (see figure 6\\).       A postinstall script is a sequence of instructions which runs after the successful installation of an OSX application. This script moves the hidden \u201c.com.celastradepro.plist\u201d file from the installer package to the LaunchDaemons folder. This file is hidden because the leading \u201c.\u201d causes it to not be shown to the user if they view the folder in the Finder application. Once in the LaunchDaemons folder, this plist file will be ran on system load as root for every user. This will launch the Updater program with the CheckUpdate parameter.       As the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script then launches the Updater program with the CheckUpdate parameter and runs it in the background (\\&). The package also has \u201cDeveloped by John Broox. CELAS LLC\u201d in the Info.plist properties file.

While the CelasTradePro application is likely a modification of QT Bitcoin Trader, the legitimate QT Bitcoin Trader DMG for OSX does not contain the postinstall script nor the plist file which creates a LaunchDaemon. When ran, only QTBitcoinTrader will be installed, and no additional programs will be created, installed, or launched.       The CelasTradePro DMG contains the CelasTradePro OSX executable (the modified version of QT Bitcoin Trader) as well as the additional Updater OSX executable not included with the original QT Bitcoin Trader.

Upon launch, the malware checks for the \u201cCheckUpdate\u201d parameter, and just as the Windows sample, will exit if the parameter is not found. This is likely to avoid sandbox analysis. If the \u201cCheckUpdate\u201d parameter is found, the malware then creates a unique identifier for the system following the format \u201c%09d\\-%06d.\"       Updater then uses dedicated QT classes to get system information including host name, OS type and version, system architecture, and OS kernel type and version. The QT Framework is a cross\\-platform toolkit designed for creating multi\\-platform applications with native Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for each platform.

As this site was the command and control server (C2\\), the payload cannot be confirmed.

According to reporting from the cyber\\-security organization that published the original AppleJeus report, the key extracted from the FALLCHILL variant used in the Celas Trade Pro application is \u201cDA E1 61 FF 0C 27 95 87 17 57 A4 D6 EA E3 82 2B.\" This RC4 key has also been used in a previous version of FALLCHILL used by DPRK actors, as further documented in the US\\-CERT Malware Analysis Report AR18\\-165A released on June 14, 2018\\. This report was a joint effort by the FBI and DHS, while working with other U.S. Government partners, to analyze and attribute computer intrusion activity from the DPRK.       Note: The version numbers for AppleJeus correspond to the order the campaigns were identified open source or through investigative means. These versions may or may not be in the correct order for development or deployment of the AppleJeus campaigns.      Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
