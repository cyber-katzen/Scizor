QNX has produced a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities. Luigi\u00a0Auriemma has confirmed that the patch resolves the reported vulnerabilities.\nProof-of-concept code has been publicly released that takes advantage of these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nExploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following QNX products are affected:\n\nPhrelay (all versions),\nPhwindows (all versions), and\nPhditto (all versions).\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nQNX is a Canadian-based company that produces the QNX Operating System. The QNX Operating System is a general purpose operating system upon which many device manufacturers build their embedded systems. The embedded systems are used primarily in the US but also worldwide. The embedded systems are used in multiple sectors including critical manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, defense industrial base, communications, energy, nuclear facilities, and commercial facilities.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERVIEWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, Web site last accessed July 08, 2013.\n\nThe bpe_decompress function used in all the client/server programs of this protocol is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow caused by the lack of checks on the data sequentially stored in two buffers. By sending a specially crafted packet to Port 4868/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS or possibly execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2013-2687NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2687, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed July 08, 2013.\n\nBUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUTCWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html, Web site last accessed July 08, 2013.\n\nThe program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow affects Phrelay in the handling of the device file specified by the client as an existing session in Phrelay, Phditto, and Phwindows. By sending a specially crafted packet to Port\u00a04868/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS or possibly execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2013-2688NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2688 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last visited July 08, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nQNX has released a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The patch is compatible with targets that are running QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 or 6.5.0 SP1. The patch is available on the QNX Web site:\nhttp://www.qnx.com/download/feature.html?programid=24850\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last visited July 08, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last visited July 08, 2013. that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
