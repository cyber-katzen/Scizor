EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: Pavilion8\nVulnerability: Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve other user's sessions data.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rockwell Automation Pavilion8, a model predictive control software, are affected:\n\nPavilion8: versions v5.17.00 and v5.17.01\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe JMX Console within the Pavilion is exposed to application users and does not require authentication. If exploited, a malicious user could retrieve other application users' session data and or log users out of their sessions.\nCVE-2023-29463\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends customers apply the following mitigations:\n\nUpdate to\u00a0v5.20\n\nRockwell Automation encourages customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations, if possible and to implement the suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability.\nIf customers are unable to update to v5.20, please follow the instructions below to disable the vulnerability in v5.17.\n\nOpen the web.xml file in your Pavilion8\u00ae installation folder set during installation and go to \"Console\\container\\webapps\\ROOT\\WEB-INF;\" by default this would be under \"C:\\Pavilion\\Console\\container\\webapps\\ROOT\\WEB-INF.\"\nSearch for the text \"jmx-console-action-handler\" and delete the below lines from web.xml file:\n\n\n/servlet/\n/servlet-name/ jmx-console-action-handler</servlet-name/\n/servlet-class/com.pav.jboss.jmx.HtmlAdaptorServlet</servlet-class/\n/servlet/\n/servlet-mapping/\n/servlet-name/ jmx-console-action-handler</servlet-name/\n/url-pattern /jmx-console/HtmlAdaptor</url-pattern/\n/servlet-mapping/\n\n\nSave the changes and close the file.\nRestart Pavilion8 Console Service.\nLogout and log back into the console and navigate to the URL http://\u00a0FQDN\u00a0/jmx-console to confirm you are getting the error message \"HTTP Status 404 \u2013 Not Found.\"\n\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation's\u00a0Security Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
