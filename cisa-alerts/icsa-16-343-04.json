INTERSCHALT has produced a patch to mitigate this vulnerability. Maxim Rupp has tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nINTERSCHALT reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of VDR G4e:\n\nVersions 5.220 and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read/download arbitrary files from the target host.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nINTERSCHALT is a German-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, China, and Germany.\nThe affected product, VDR G4e, is a maritime voyage data recorder. According to INTERSCHALT, VDR G4e is deployed in the Transportation Systems sector. INTERSCHALT estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY (\u201cPATH TRAVERSAL\u201d)CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (\u2018Path Traversal\u2019), https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\n\nExternal input is used to construct paths to files and directories without properly neutralizing special elements within the pathname that could allow an attacker to read files on the system.\nCVE-2016-9339NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9339, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nINTERSCHALT recommends that affected users update their devices to Version 5.230 as soon as possible.\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
