These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate known IOCs, TTPs, and detection methods associated with the AvosLocker variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as May 2023\\. AvosLocker operates under a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) model. AvosLocker affiliates have compromised organizations across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in the United States, affecting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments. AvosLocker affiliates compromise organizations\u2019 networks by using legitimate software and open\\-source remote system administration tools. AvosLocker affiliates then use exfiltration\\-based data extortion tactics with threats of leaking and/or publishing stolen data.\n \n\n\n\n This joint CSA updates the March 17, 2022, AvosLocker ransomware joint CSA,\n [Indicators of Compromise Associated with AvosLocker ransomware](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220318.pdf \"Indicators of Compromise Associated with AvosLocker Ransomware\") \n , released by FBI and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This update includes IOCs and TTPs not included in the previous advisory and a YARA rule FBI developed after analyzing a tool associated with an AvosLocker compromise.\n \n\n\n\n FBI and CISA encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of AvosLocker ransomware and other ransomware incidents.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-284A \\#StopRansomware: AvosLocker Ransomware (Update)](/sites/default/files/2023-10/aa23-284a-joint-csa-stopransomware-avoslocker-ransomware-update.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 528\\.00 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-284A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2023-10/AA23-284A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 46\\.67 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-284A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2023-10/AA23-284A%20StopRansomware%20AvosLocker%20Ransomware%20Update.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 34\\.50 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n***Note:** \n This advisory uses the* \n[*MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise*](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\")\n*framework, version 13\\.

This persistence tool sends pings from the network every five minutes. The NetMonitor executable is configured to use an IP address as its command server, and the program communicates with the server over port 443\\. During the attack, traffic between NetMonitor and the command server is encrypted, where NetMonitor functions like a reverse proxy and allows actors to connect to the tool from outside the victim\u2019s network.\n \n\n\n#### YARA Rule\n\n\n\n\n| `rule NetMonitor`   `{`   `meta:`   `author = \"FBI\"`   `source = \"FBI\"`   `sharing = \"TLP:CLEAR\"`   `status = \"RELEASED\"`   `description = \"Yara rule to detect NetMonitor.exe\"`   `category = \"MALWARE\"`   `creation_date = \"2023-05-05\"`   `strings:`   `$rc4key = {11 4b 8c dd 65 74 22 c3}`   `$op0 = {c6 [3] 00 00 05 c6 [3] 00 00 07 83 [3] 00 00 05 0f 85 [4] 83 [3] 00 00 01 75 ?? 8b [2] 4c 8d [2] 4c 8d [3] 00 00 48 8d [3] 00 00 48 8d [3] 00 00 48 89 [3] 48 89 ?? e8}`   `condition:`   `uint16(0) == 0x5A4D`   `and filesize < 50000`   `and any of them`   `}` |\n| --- |\n\n\n### **MITRE ATT\\&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES**\n\n\n\n See Tables 3\\-7 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 3: AvosLocker Affiliates ATT\\&CK Techniques for Initial Access* \n\n| **Initial Access** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| External Remote Services | [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") | AvosLocker affiliates use remote system administration tools\u2014Splashtop Streamer, Tactical RMM, PuTTy, AnyDesk, PDQ Deploy, and Atera Agent\u2014to access backdoor access vectors. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 4: AvosLocker Affiliates ATT\\&CK Techniques for Execution* \n\n| **Execution** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell | [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\") | AvosLocker affiliates use custom PowerShell scripts to enable privilege escalation, lateral movement, and to disable antivirus. |\n| Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell | [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/003/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\") | AvosLocker affiliates use custom  `.bat`   scripts to enable privilege escalation, lateral movement, and to disable antivirus. |\n| Windows Management Instrumentation | [T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1047/ \"Windows Management Instrumentation\") | AvosLocker affiliates use legitimate Windows tools, such as PsExec and Nltest in their execution. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 5: AvosLocker Affiliates ATT\\&CK Techniques for Persistence* \n\n| **Persistence** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| Server Software Component | [T1505\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1505/003/ \"Server Software Component\") | AvosLocker affiliates have uploaded and used custom webshells to enable network access. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 6: AvosLocker Affiliates ATT\\&CK Techniques for Credential Access* \n\n| **Credential Access** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| Credentials from Password Stores | [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/ \"Credentials from Password Stores\") | AvosLocker affiliates use open\\-source applications Lazagne and Mimikatz to steal credentials from system stores. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 7: AvosLocker Affiliates ATT\\&CK Techniques for Command and Control* \n\n| **Command and Control** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| Protocol Tunneling | [T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1572/ \"Protocol Tunneling\") | AvosLocker affiliates use open source networking tunneling tools like Ligolo and Chisel. |\n\n\n### **MITIGATIONS**\n\n\n\n These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. The FBI and CISA recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles and tactics into their software development practices to limit the impact of ransomware techniques (such as threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities into remote software systems), thus, strengthening the secure posture for their customers.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design and Default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage and\n [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default \"Security-by-Design and -Default\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actor activity and to reduce the risk of compromise by AvosLocker ransomware. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n* Secure remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Implementing application controls** \n\t to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs. Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n\t+ Applying recommendations in CISA's joint\n\t [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf \"GUIDE TO SECURING REMOTE ACCESS SOFTWARE\") \n\t .\n* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services** \n . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]:\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ Apply\n\t [phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n\t .\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n* **Disable command\\-line and scripting activities and permissions** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.N](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]\n **.**\n* **Restrict the use of PowerShell** \n , using Group Policy, and only grant access to specific users on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Typically, only those users or administrators who manage the network or Windows operating systems (OSs) should be permitted to use PowerShell \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Update Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core** \n to the latest version and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions. Logs from Windows PowerShell prior to version 5\\.0 are either non\\-existent or do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E, 2\\.S, 2\\.T](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Enable enhanced PowerShell logging** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.T, 2\\.U](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n\t+ PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and possible TTPs of a threat actor\u2019s PowerShell use.\n\t+ Ensure PowerShell instances, using the latest version, have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).\n\t+ The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log and the PowerShell Operational Log. FBI and CISA recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.\n\n\n\n**Configure the Windows Registry to require User Account Control (UAC) approval for any PsExec operations** \n requiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.\n \n\n\n\n In addition, FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Disable File and Printer sharing services.** \n If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data,** \n and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization minimizes the impact of disruption to business practices as they will not be as severe and/or only have irretrievable data \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]. Recommend organizations follow the 3\\-2\\-1 backup strategy in which organizations have three copies of data (one copy of production data and two backup copies) on two different media such as disk and tape, with one copy kept off\\-site for disaster recovery.\n* **Require all accounts** \n with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\n **to comply** \n with\n [NIST's standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\") \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.B](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\n\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\n\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.C](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.G](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\n\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\t   \n\t\n\t**Note:** \n\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication** \n for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Organizations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to 48 hours of vulnerability disclosure. Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \n in internet\\-facing systems \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Segment networks** \n to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections, as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software** \n on all hosts.\n* **Disable unused** \n**ports** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.V](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]\n **.**\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI and CISA recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 3\\-7\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n FBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.stopransomware.gov/ \"#StopRansomware\") \n is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\n* The\n [Joint Ransomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\") \n provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices as well as a ransomware response checklist.\n* [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services\") \n and\n [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"Ransomware Readiness Assessment CSET v10.3\") \n provide no\\-cost cyber hygiene and ransomware readiness assessment services.\n\n\n### **REPORTING**\n\n\n\n The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with AvosLocker affiliates, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\\) at\n [ic3\\.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\") \n ,\n [local FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\") \n , or CISA via the agency\u2019s\n [Incident Reporting System](https://www.cisa.gov/forms/report \"Incident Reporting System\") \n or its 24/7 Operations Center at\n [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov?subject=Ransomware%20Incident \"Report to CISA\") \n or by calling 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA (1\\-844\\-729\\-2472\\).\n \n\n\n### **DISCLAIMER**\n\n\n\n The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
