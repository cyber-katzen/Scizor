EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: CP-8050, CP-8031\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with knowledge of the corresponding credential to login to the device via SSH.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected if activated with debug support:\n\nCP-8031 MASTER MODULE (6MF2803-1AA00): All versions prior to CPCI85 V05.11\nCP-8050 MASTER MODULE (6MF2805-0AA00): All versions prior to CPCI85 V05.11\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected devices contain a hard-coded ID in the SSH\u00a0authorized_keys configuration file. An attacker with knowledge of the corresponding private key could login to the device via SSH. Only devices with activated debug support are affected.\nCVE-2023-36380\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSteffen Robertz, Gerhard Hechenberger, Stefan Viehb\u00f6ck, Christian Hager, and Gorazd Jank from SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab reported the vulnerability on behalf of Netz Nieder\u00f6sterreich GmbH, EVN Gruppe.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nCP-8050 MASTER MODULE (6MF2805-0AA00): Update to CPCI85 V05.11 or\u00a0later version.\nCP-8031 MASTER MODULE (6MF2803-1AA00): Update to CPCI85 V05.11 or\u00a0later version.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-134651 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
