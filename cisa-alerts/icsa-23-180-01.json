MITIGATIONS--------------- \u200bDelta Electronics has provided a fix to these vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to update to the latest version.* \u200bDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master: Update to [v1\\.0\\.7](https://datacenter-softwarecenter.deltaww.com/Download/UPS/Software/InfraSuite_Device_Master_1.0.7(x64).exe)  . \u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* \u200bMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* \u200bLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* \u200bWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. \u200bCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. \u200bCISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . \u200bAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . \u200bOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. \u200bNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
