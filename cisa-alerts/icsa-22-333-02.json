[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHitachi Energy IED Connectivity Packages and PCM600 Products============================================================ Last Revised November 29, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-333\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.1*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  PCM600* **Vulnerability:**  Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive credentials and gain access to the affected products, perform unauthorized modifications, or provoke a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Hitachi Energy\u2019s IED Connectivity Packages and PCM600 products are affected:* PCM600: v2\\.11 and previous versions, including hotfixes* 670 Connectivity Package: versions from 3\\.0 to 3\\.4\\.1* 650 Connectivity Package: versions from 1\\.3 to 2\\.4\\.1* SAM600\\-IO Connectivity Package: versions from 1\\.0 to 1\\.2* GMS600 Connectivity Package: versions from 1\\.3 to 1\\.3\\.1* PWC600 Connectivity Package: versions from 1\\.1 to 1\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### **3\\.2\\.1 [CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-312](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)** A vulnerability exists in the Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) Connectivity Package (ConnPack) credential storage function in Hitachi Energy\u2019s PCM600 products in which IED credentials are stored in cleartext inside the PCM600 database. An unauthorized user who gains access to the exported backup file could exploit this vulnerability and obtain IED credentials, which could be used to perform unauthorized modifications, such as loading incorrect configurations, rebooting the IEDs, or causing a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-2513](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2513)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy released the following recommended immediate actions:* Update to PCM600 v2\\.11 Hotfix 20220923 or apply mitigation factors/workarounds Hitachi Energy recommends the following steps to mitigate the risk of vulnerability exploitation:* Implement the least privilege principle, continuously revising permissions and accesses to PCM600 related resources, including the backup file (a PCMI/PCMP file.)* Use a firewall system with the\u00a0minimal number of exposed ports to help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network.* Protect process control systems from direct, physical access by unauthorized personnel.* Ensure process control systems are not directly connected to the internet.* Separate process control systems from other networks via network segmentation techniques.* Avoid using process control systems for browsing the internet, instant messaging, or receiving emails.* Scan removable storage media for malware prior to connection to a process control system.
