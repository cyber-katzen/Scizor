MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\u00a0Begin\u00a0Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens and PKE recommend users to update to [v5\\.0\\.0 or later](https://sivms.cloud/sivms-platform/)  . Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the video servers to ensure only legitimate systems can access the configured server ports.* Harden all systems accordingly to prevent unauthorized access.* Consider applying encryption and authentication on the network (e.g., via TLS on application level or via IPSec on host level).* Disable the two FTP services of the video server.* The update to v5\\.0\\.2 also provides an additional authentication feature that allows users to protect access to the streaming service via individual account names and passwords for every stream recorder. Users are encouraged to configure this feature accordingly. For details, see the release notes of v5\\.0\\.2**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\u00a0End Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises users to follow recommended security practices to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA\\-844761](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-844761.pdf)  and [PKE security advisory](https://sivms.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sivms-cve-fixes_1.0_EN.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\u00a0Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.* Exercise principles of least privilege. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
