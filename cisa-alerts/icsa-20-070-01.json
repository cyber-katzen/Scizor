In configurations where the FTP service is enabled, authenticated remote attackers could extract login credentials of other users of the service.\nCVE-2019-19291 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string \u00a0is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access and download arbitrary files from the server if the FTP services are enabled.\nCVE-2019-19296 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string \u00a0is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access and download arbitrary files from the server.\nCVE-2019-19297 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string \u00a0is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition by sending malformed HTTP requests.\nCVE-2019-19298 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string \u00a0is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327\nThe affected product contains weak cryptography when exposing device passwords. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read and decrypt the passwords and conduct further attacks.\nCVE-2019-19299 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string \u00a0is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Information Technology\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\n---------\u00a0Begin\u00a0Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens and PKE recommend users to update to v5.0.0 or later.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nApply ACL/firewall configuration on the video servers to ensure only legitimate systems can access the configured server ports.\nHarden all systems accordingly to prevent unauthorized access.\nConsider applying encryption and authentication on the network (e.g., via TLS on application level or via IPSec on host level).\nDisable the two FTP services of the video server.\nThe update to v5.0.2 also provides an additional authentication feature that allows users to protect access to the streaming service via individual account names and passwords for every stream recorder. Users are encouraged to configure this feature accordingly. For details, see the release notes of v5.0.2\n\n---------\u00a0End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises users to follow recommended security practices to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-844761 and PKE security advisory.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\u00a0Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nExercise principles of least privilege.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
