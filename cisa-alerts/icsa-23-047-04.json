MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens released an update for Brownfield Connectivity\u2014Gateway and recommends updating to V1\\.11 or later version.\n [Contact Siemens support](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/de/view/109801700) \n to obtain the update.\n \n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n , and following the recommendations in the product manuals. See additional information on industrial security on the\n [Siemens website](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact\n [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-744259 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-744259.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-744259.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users to protect themselves from social engineering attacks.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
