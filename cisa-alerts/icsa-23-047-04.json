MITIGATIONS\nSiemens released an update for Brownfield Connectivity\u2014Gateway and recommends updating to V1.11 or later version.\u00a0Contact Siemens support\u00a0to obtain the update.\u00a0\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals. See additional information on industrial security on the\u00a0Siemens website. \u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT. \u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-744259 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users to protect themselves from social engineering attacks.\u00a0\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\n",
