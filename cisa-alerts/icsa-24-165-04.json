TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products, are affected:* Siemens ST7 ScadaConnect (6NH7997\\-5DA10\\-0AA0\\): Versions prior to 1\\.1### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE\\-190**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html) An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2\\.10\\.3\\. When parsing a multi\\-gigabyte XML document with the XML\\_PARSE\\_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault.[CVE\\-2022\\-40303](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40303)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.2** [**DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html) An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2\\.10\\.3\\. Certain invalid XML entity definitions can corrupt a hash table key, potentially leading to subsequent logic errors. In one case, a double\\-free can be provoked.[CVE\\-2022\\-40304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.3** [**IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE\\-295**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the \\-policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() function.[CVE\\-2023\\-0464](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0464)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.4** [**IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE\\-295**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) Applications that use a non\\-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the \\-policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() function.[CVE\\-2023\\-0465](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0465)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.5** [**IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE\\-295**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) The function X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy()function.Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set\\_flags() with the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_POLICY\\_CHECK flag argument.Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.[CVE\\-2023\\-0466](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0466)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.6** [**INEFFICIENT REGULAR EXPRESSION COMPLEXITY CWE\\-1333**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html) Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial\\-of\\-Service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH\\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial\\-of\\-Service attack. The function DH\\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_ex() and EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '\\-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-3446](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3446)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.7** [**IMPROPER CHECK FOR UNUSUAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE\\-754**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html) Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9\\.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9\\.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\\_generate\\_key() to generate an X9\\.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key(), DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_public\\_check() to check an X9\\.42 DH key or X9\\.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial\\-of\\-Service. While DH\\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE\\-2023\\-3817\\), DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH\\_generate\\_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls DH\\_generate\\_key() or DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial\\-of\\-Service attack. DH\\_generate\\_key() and DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key\\_ex(), EVP\\_PKEY\\_public\\_check(), and EVP\\_PKEY\\_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the \"\\-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-5678](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-5678)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* ST7 ScadaConnect (6NH7997\\-5DA10\\-0AA0\\): [Update to V1\\.1](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109955597/)  or later version. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-341067 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-341067.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-341067.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
