WellinTech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following KingView versions are affected:\n\nKingView versions older than Version 6.53.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to overwrite files and copy them from one location to another on the target machine.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nWellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control. WellinTech is based in Beijing, China, with branches in the United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan.\nAccording to the WellinTech Web site, the KingView product is a Windows-based control, monitoring, and data collection application deployed across several industries including power, water, building automation, mining, and others.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSECURE ACTIVEX CONTROLCWE-40: Path Traversal: '\\\\UNC\\share\\name\\' (Windows UNC Share), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/40.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013.\n\nWellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the SuperGrid.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks.\nThis proof of concept will copy any arbitrary file from one location to a second location. It can also be used to overwrite existing files. This vulnerability may be used to inject files which, in turn, may allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2013-6127NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-6127, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited October 22, 2013.\n\nACTIVEX REMOTE FILE CREATION/OVERWRITECWE-28: Path Traversal: '..\\filedir', http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/28.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013.\n\nWellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the KChartXY.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input.\nProof of concept overwrites the win.ini file.\nCVE-2013-6128NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-6128, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited October 22, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nWellinTech has provided the following links to download new versions of the affected files:\n\nSuperGrid.ocx Version number\uff1a65.30.30000.10002\n\nhttp://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/SuperGrid.rar\n\nKChartXY.ocx Version number\uff1a65.30.30000.10002\n\nhttp://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/KChartXY.rar\nIt is also possible to correct the flaw by implementing the following workarounds:\n\nSet the kill-bit on the KChartXY ActiveX Control (CLSID A9A2011A-1E02-4242-AAE0-B239A6F88BAC).\nSet the kill-bit on the SuperGrid ActiveX Control (CLSID F494550F-A028-4817-A7B5-E5F2DCB4A47E).\n\nFor specific information on mitigating ActiveX vulnerabilities, see Microsoft KB article 240797.Microsoft Support article: How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013.\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013. NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013. that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
