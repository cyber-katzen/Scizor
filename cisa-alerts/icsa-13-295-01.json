[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryWellinTech KingView ActiveX Vulnerabilities=========================================== Last Revised December 17, 2013 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-295\\-01OVERVIEW-------- This advisory is a follow\\-up to the alert titled ICS\\-ALERT\\-13\\-256\\-01 WellinTech KingView ActiveX VulnerabilitiesICS\\-ALERT\\-13\\-256\\-01 WellinTech KingView ActiveX Vulnerabilities, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/alerts/ICS\\-ALERT\\-13\\-256\\-01, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. that was published September 13, 2013, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT Web site. Independent researcher \u201cBlake\u201d identified ActiveX vulnerabilities and released proof\\-of\\-concept (exploit) code for WellinTech KingView application without coordination with NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity known to NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT. WellinTech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following KingView versions are affected:* KingView versions older than Version 6\\.53\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to overwrite files and copy them from one location to another on the target machine. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- WellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control. WellinTech is based in Beijing, China, with branches in the United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan. According to the WellinTech Web site, the KingView product is a Windows\\-based control, monitoring, and data collection application deployed across several industries including power, water, building automation, mining, and others.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INSECURE ACTIVEX CONTROLCWE\\-40: Path Traversal: '\\\\\\\\UNC\\\\share\\\\name\\\\' (Windows UNC Share), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/40\\.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. WellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the SuperGrid.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks. This proof of concept will copy any arbitrary file from one location to a second location. It can also be used to overwrite existing files. This vulnerability may be used to inject files which, in turn, may allow arbitrary code execution. CVE\\-2013\\-6127NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-6127, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited October 22, 2013\\.### ACTIVEX REMOTE FILE CREATION/OVERWRITECWE\\-28: Path Traversal: '..\\\\filedir', http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/28\\.html, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. WellinTech KingView contains a flaw in the KChartXY.ocx ActiveX control that allows an attacker to traverse outside a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input. Proof of concept overwrites the win.ini file. CVE\\-2013\\-6128NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-6128, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited October 22, 2013\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.MITIGATION---------- WellinTech has provided the following links to download new versions of the affected files:* SuperGrid.ocx Version number\uff1a65\\.30\\.30000\\.10002[http://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/SuperGrid.rar](http://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/SuperGrid.rar%20) * KChartXY.ocx Version number\uff1a65\\.30\\.30000\\.10002[http://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/KChartXY.rar](http://www.kingview.com/en/downloads/Downloads/KChartXY.rar%20)  It is also possible to correct the flaw by implementing the following workarounds:* Set the kill\\-bit on the KChartXY ActiveX Control (CLSID A9A2011A\\-1E02\\-4242\\-AAE0\\-B239A6F88BAC).* Set the kill\\-bit on the SuperGrid ActiveX Control (CLSID F494550F\\-A028\\-4817\\-A7B5\\-E5F2DCB4A47E). For specific information on mitigating ActiveX vulnerabilities, see Microsoft KB article 240797\\.Microsoft Support article: How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/tips/ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B, Web site last accessed October 22, 2013\\. that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT Web page ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
