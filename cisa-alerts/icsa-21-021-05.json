An attacker could exploit this vulnerability on the workstation by supplying/providing a manipulated project file. If that manipulated project file is loaded, malicious code could be executed without notice.[CVE\\-2020\\-12525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12525)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Emerson reported this vulnerability to CISA and M\\&M Software.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- M\\&M Software recommends users choose one of the following solutions:* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version that provides a more secure deserialization of the project data. This version will still use a deprecated serialization technology but will fix the currently known attack vector and will be compatible with existing, non\\-manipulated project files.* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version (fdtCONTAINER component: 3\\.7 or newer, fdtCONTAINER application: 4\\.7 or newer) that provides a secure deserialization of the project data with an updated serialization technology. This will break the compatibility to existing, non\\-manipulated project files. The [CERT@VDE advisory for M\\&M Software](https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-048)  also recommends the following mitigation practices:* Exchange project data only via secure exchange services.* Use appropriate means to protect the project storage from unauthorized manipulation.* Do not open project data from an unknown source.* Reduce the user rights of the host application to the necessary minimum. Emerson has published a notification ( [EMR.RMT20004\\.Rev3](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/emr-rmt20004-rev3-en-7259618.pdf)  ) for this vulnerability in RTIS. RTIS users should review this notification for additional information specific to RTIS. CERT@VDE has published an advisory ( [VDE\\-2021\\-001](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-001)  ) for this vulnerability in PEPPERL\\+FUCHS PACTware. CERT@VDE has published an advisory ( [VDE\\-2021\\-002](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-002)  ) for this vulnerability in Weidm\u00fcller FDT/DTM Software with WI Manager. Mitsubishi Electric has published advisory [2020\\-020](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-020_en.pdf)  concerning the vulnerability in MELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator. CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Do not open project files from untrusted sources.* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  .
