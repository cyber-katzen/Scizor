RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n If an attacker can socially engineer a valid user into loading a manipulated project file, malicious code can be executed without notice.\n \n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following products are affected:\n \n\n\n* fdtCONTAINER component\n\t+ Versions between 3\\.5\\.0 and 3\\.5\\.20304\\.x\n\t+ Versions between 3\\.6\\.0 and 3\\.6\\.20304\\.x\n\t+ Versions older than 3\\.5\n* fdtCONTAINER application\n\t+ Versions between 4\\.5\\.0 and 4\\.5\\.20304\\.x\n\t+ Versions between 4\\.6\\.0 and 4\\.6\\.20304\\.x\n\t+ Versions older than 4\\.5\n* dtmINSPECTOR Version 3 (Based on FDT 1\\.2\\.x)\n\n\n\n There are reports indicating the following products incorporate the affected component:\n \n\n\n* Emerson Rosemount Transmitter Interface Software (RTIS) SKUs: 04088\\-9000\\-0001, 4088\\-9000\\-0002, and 7000003\\-312\n* PEPPERL\\+FUCHS PACTware 5\\.0, up to and including Version 5\\.0\\.5\\.31\n* Weidm\u00fcller WI Manager up to and including Version 2\\.5\\.1\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n* Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator, Versions 1\\.05 F and prior\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End\u00a0Update C Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 4\\.2\\.1\n [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE\\-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)\n\n\n\n A vulnerability has been discovered in the fdtCONTAINER component issued by M\\&M Software and used by other products, including RTIS and PACTware. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability on the workstation by supplying/providing a manipulated project file. If that manipulated project file is loaded, malicious code could be executed without notice.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-12525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12525) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Germany\n\n\n### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Emerson reported this vulnerability to CISA and M\\&M Software.\n \n\n\n5\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n M\\&M Software recommends users choose one of the following solutions:\n \n\n\n* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version that provides a more secure deserialization of the project data. This version will still use a deprecated serialization technology but will fix the currently known attack vector and will be compatible with existing, non\\-manipulated project files.\n* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version (fdtCONTAINER component: 3\\.7 or newer, fdtCONTAINER application: 4\\.7 or newer) that provides a secure deserialization of the project data with an updated serialization technology. This will break the compatibility to existing, non\\-manipulated project files.\n\n\n\n The\n [CERT@VDE advisory for M\\&M Software](https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-048) \n also recommends the following mitigation practices:\n \n\n\n* Exchange project data only via secure exchange services.\n* Use appropriate means to protect the project storage from unauthorized manipulation.\n* Do not open project data from an unknown source.\n* Reduce the user rights of the host application to the necessary minimum.\n\n\n\n Emerson has published a notification (\n [EMR.RMT20004\\.Rev3](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/emr-rmt20004-rev3-en-7259618.pdf) \n ) for this vulnerability in RTIS. RTIS users should review this notification for additional information specific to RTIS.\n   \n\n  \n\n CERT@VDE has published an advisory (\n [VDE\\-2021\\-001](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-001) \n ) for this vulnerability in PEPPERL\\+FUCHS PACTware.\n   \n\n  \n\n CERT@VDE has published an advisory (\n [VDE\\-2021\\-002](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-002) \n ) for this vulnerability in Weidm\u00fcller FDT/DTM Software with WI Manager.\n   \n\n  \n\n Mitsubishi Electric has published advisory\n [2020\\-020](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-020_en.pdf) \n concerning the vulnerability in MELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator.\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.\n* Do not open project files from untrusted sources.\n* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n .
