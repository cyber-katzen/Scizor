Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.\n2. Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.\n3. Enforce multifactor authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to provide information on the Karakurt data extortion group, also known as the Karakurt Team and Karakurt Lair. Karakurt actors have employed a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Karakurt victims have not reported encryption of compromised machines or files; rather, Karakurt actors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it to the public unless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. Known ransom demands have ranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire within a week of first contact with the victim.\n \n\n\n\n Karakurt actors have typically provided screenshots or copies of stolen file directories as proof of stolen data. Karakurt actors have contacted victims\u2019 employees, business partners, and clients \\[\n [T1591\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1591/002/ \"Gather Victim Org Information: Business Relationships\") \n ] with harassing emails and phone calls to pressure the victims to cooperate. The emails have contained examples of stolen data, such as social security numbers, payment accounts, private company emails, and sensitive business data belonging to employees or clients. Upon payment of ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a brief statement explaining how the initial intrusion occurred.\n \n\n\n\n Prior to January 5, 2022, Karakurt operated a leaks and auction website found at https://karakurt\\[.]group. The domain and IP address originally hosting the website went offline in the spring 2022\\. The website is no longer accessible on the open internet, but has been reported to be located elsewhere in the deep web and on the dark web. As of May 2022, the website contained several terabytes of data purported to belong to victims across North America and Europe, along with several \u201cpress releases\u201d naming victims who had not paid or cooperated, and instructions for participating in victim data \u201cauctions.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA22\\-152A Karakurt Data Extortion Group](/sites/default/files/2023-12/aa22-152a-karakurt-data-extortion-group.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 508\\.81 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-152A.stix.xml) \n for STIX.\n \n\n\n### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n\n#### **Initial Intrusion**\n\n\n\n Karakurt does not appear to target any specific sectors, industries, or types of victims. During reconnaissance \\[\n [TA0043](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0043/ \"Reconnaissance\") \n ], Karakurt actors appear to obtain access to victim devices primarily:\n \n\n\n* By purchasing stolen login credentials \\[\n [T1589\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials\") \n ],\\[\n [T1589\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/002/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses\") \n ];\n* Via cooperating partners in the cybercrime community, who provide Karakurt access to already compromised victims; or\n* Through buying access to already compromised victims via third\\-party intrusion broker networks \\[\n [T1589\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials\") \n ].\n\t+ **Note:** \n\t Intrusion brokers, or intrusion broker networks, are malicious individual cyber actors or groups of actors who use a variety of tools and skills to obtain initial access to\u2014and often create marketable persistence within\u2014protected computer systems. Intrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised computer systems to other cybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in ransomware, business email compromise, corporate and government espionage, etc.\n\n\n\n Some Karakurt victims have reported that initial intrusion may have occurred via compromised Cisco AnyConnect VPN user accounts. Many of these victims reported multi\\-factor authentication was not enforced for their Cisco AnyConnect VPN platforms.\n \n\n\n\n Common intrusion vulnerabilities exploited for initial access \\[\n [TA001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0001/ \"Initial Access\") \n ] in Karakurt events include the following:\n \n\n\n* Outdated SonicWall SSL VPN appliances \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ] are vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs,\n* Log4j \u201cLog4Shell\u201d Apache Logging Services vulnerability (CVE\\-2021\\-44228\\) \\[\n [T1190]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ,\n* Phishing and spearphishing \\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\") \n ],\n* Malicious macros within email attachments \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/001/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\") \n ],\n* Stolen virtual private network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials\n [\\[T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ],\n* Outdated Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ]/firewall appliances \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ] are vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs,\n* Outdated and/or unserviceable Microsoft Windows Server instances,\n* Outdated and/or unpatched Cisco AnyConnect software and hardware appliances.\n\n\n#### **Network Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Persistence, and Exfiltration**\n\n\n\n Upon developing or obtaining access to a compromised system, Karakurt actors deploy\n [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\") \n beacons to enumerate a network \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\") \n ], install Mimikatz to pull plain\\-text credentials \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ], use AnyDesk to obtain persistent remote control \\[\n [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\") \n ], and utilize additional situation\\-dependent tools to elevate privileges and move laterally within a network.\n \n\n\n\n Karakurt actors then compress (typically with 7zip) and exfiltrate large sums of data\u2014and, in many cases, entire network\\-connected shared drives in volumes exceeding 1 terabyte (TB)\u2014using open source applications and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services \\[\n [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1048/ \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\") \n ] such as Filezilla and cloud storage services including rclone and Mega.nz \\[\n [T1567\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1567/002/ \"Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Extortion**\n\n\n\n Following the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by way of \u201creadme.txt\u201d files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email networks, and emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. The ransom notes reveal the victim has been hacked by the \u201cKarakurt Team\u201d and threaten public release or auction of the stolen data. The instructions include a link to a TOR URL with an access code. Visiting the URL and inputting the access code open a chat application over which victims can negotiate with Karakurt actors to have their data deleted.\n \n\n\n\n Karakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which employees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning the recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the dissemination of victim data. These communications often included samples of stolen data\u2014primarily personally identifiable information (PII), such as employment records, health records, and financial business records.\n \n\n\n\n Victims who negotiate with Karakurt actors receive \u201cproof of life,\u201d such as screenshots showing file trees of allegedly stolen data or, in some cases, actual copies of stolen files. Upon reaching an agreement on the price of the stolen data with the victims, Karakurt actors provided a Bitcoin address\u2014usually a new, previously unused address\u2014to which ransom payments could be made.\n \n\n\n\n Upon receiving the ransom, Karakurt actors provide some form of alleged proof of deletion of the stolen files, such as a screen recording of the files being deleted, a deletion log, or credentials for a victim to log into a storage server and delete the files themselves.\n \n\n\n\n Although Karakurt\u2019s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep the incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the confidentiality of victim information after a ransom was paid.\n **Note:** \n The U.S. government strongly discourage the payment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber criminals promising to delete stolen files in exchange for payments.\n \n\n\n\n In some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked by other ransomware variants. In such cases, Karakurt actors likely purchased or otherwise obtained previously stolen data. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time these victims were under attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received ransom notes from multiple ransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors purchased access to a compromised system that was also sold to another ransomware actor.\n \n\n\n\n Karakurt actors have also exaggerated the degree to which a victim had been compromised and the value of data stolen. For example, in some instances, Karakurt actors claimed to steal volumes of data far beyond the storage capacity of compromised systems or claimed to steal data that did not belong to the victim.\n \n\n\n#### **Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\n\n\n| **Email** |\n| --- |\n| mark.hubert1986@gmail.com; karakurtlair@gmail.com; personal.information.reveal@gmail.com; ripidelfun1986@protonmail.com; gapreappballye1979@protonmail.com; confedicial.datas.download@protonmail.com; armada.mitchell94@protonmail.com |\n| *Protonmail email accounts in the following formats:*   victimname\\_treasure@protonmail.com, victimname\\_jewels@protonmail.com,\u00a0victimname\\_files@protonmail.com |\n\n\n\n\n| **Tools** |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Onion site | https://omx5iqrdbsoitf3q4xexrqw5r5tfw7vp3vl3li3lfo7saabxazshnead.onion |\n| Tools | Rclone.exe;; AnyDesk.exe; Mimikatz |\n| Ngrok | SSH tunnel application SHA256 \\- 3e625e20d7f00b6d5121bb0a71cfa61f92d658bcd61af2cf5397e0ae28f4ba56 |\n| DLLs     masquerading as legitimate Microsoft binaries to System32 | Mscxxx.dll: SHA1 \\- c33129a680e907e5f49bcbab4227c0b02e191770 Msuxxx.dll: SHA1 \\- 030394b7a2642fe962a7705dcc832d2c08d006f5 |\n| Msxsl.exe | Legitimate Microsoft Command Line XSL Transformation Utility SHA1 \\- 8B516E7BE14172E49085C4234C9A53C6EB490A45 |\n| dllhosts.exe | Rclone SHA1 \\- fdb92fac37232790839163a3cae5f37372db7235 |\n| rclone.conf | Rclone configuration file |\n| filter.txt | Rclone file extension filter file |\n| c.bat | UNKNOWN |\n| 3\\.bat | UNKNOWN |\n| Potential malicious document | SHA1 \\- 0E50B289C99A35F4AD884B6A3FFB76DE4B6EBC14 |\n| **Tools** |  |\n| Potential malicious document | SHA1 \\- 7E654C02E75EC78E8307DBDF95E15529AAAB5DFF |\n| Malicious text     file | SHA1 \\- 4D7F4BB3A23EAB33A3A28473292D44C5965DDC95 |\n| Malicious text     file | SHA1 \\- 10326C2B20D278080AA0CA563FC3E454A85BB32F |\n\n\n\n\n| **Cobalt Strike Hashes** |\n| --- |\n| SHA256 \\- 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B |\n| SHA256 \\- 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA |\n| SHA256 \\- 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2 |\n| SHA256 \\- 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B |\n| SHA256 \\- 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA |\n| SHA256 \\- 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2 |\n| SHA1 \\- 86366bb7646dcd1a02700ed4be4272cbff5887af |\n\n\n\n\n| **Ransom note text sample:** |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1\\. | Here's the deal     We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems. |\n| 2\\. | We analyzed and located each piece of more\\-or\\-less important files while spending weeks inside. |\n| 3\\. | We exfiltrated anything we wanted (xxx GB (including Private \\& Confidential information, Intellectual Property, Customer Information and most important Your TRADE SECRETS) |\n| **Ransom note text sample:** |  |\n| FAQ: | Who the hell are you?

Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides.\n* Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts and enable real time detection.\n* Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released.\n* Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized accounts.\n* Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.\n* Disable unused ports.\n* Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n* Disable hyperlinks in received emails.\n* Enforce multi\\-factor authentication.\n* Use the\n [National Institute for Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\") \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;\n\t\t- Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers;\n\t\t- Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials;\n\t\t- Avoid reusing passwords;\n\t\t- Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;\n\t\t- Disable password \u201chints\u201d;\n\t\t- Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\t\t   \n\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t**Note:** \n\t\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t\t- Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi\\-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a VPN.\n* Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).\n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, visit\n [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\") \n as well as the\n [CISA\\-Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide](/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C.pdf \"RANSOMWARE GUIDE SEPTEMBER 2020\") \n and NIST\u2019s\n [Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other Destructive Events](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/data-integrity/detect-respond \"Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other Destructive Events\") \n .\n [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\") \n is the U.S. government\u2019s one\\-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.\n* CISA\u2019s\n [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"cisagov / cset\") \n is a no\\-cost self\\-assessment based on a tiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and recover from a ransomware incident.\n* CISA offers a range of no\\-cost\n [cyber hygiene services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"CYBER HYGIENE SERVICES\") \n to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.\n* Financial Institutions must also ensure compliance with any applicable Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including suspicious activity reporting obligations.
