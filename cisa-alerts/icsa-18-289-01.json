EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: LCDS \u2013 Le\u00e3o Consultoria e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas LTDA ME\nEquipment: LAquis SCADA\nVulnerabilities: Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Out-of-Bounds Read, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, Path Traversal, Out-of-bounds Write, and Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, crash the system, or write controlled content to the target system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of LAquis SCADA, an industrial automation software, are affected:\n\nSmart Security Manager Versions 4.1.0.3870 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\nAn untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17893 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nSeveral out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17895 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER OVERFLOW TO BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-680\nSeveral integer overflow to buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17897 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nA path traversal vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17899 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nWhen processing project files the application fails to sanitize user input prior to performing write operations on a stack object, which may allow an attacker to execute code under the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17901 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nSeveral stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17911 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: South America\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Brazil\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, rgod of 9SG Security Team, Esteban Ruiz (mr_me) of Source Incite, b0nd @garage4hackers, and Ashraf Alharbi (Ha5ha5hin) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nLCDS recommends that users update to Version 4.1.0.4114, which can be found at the following location:\nhttp://laquisscada.com/instale1.php\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
