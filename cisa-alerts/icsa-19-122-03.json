Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practice](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n s on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/) \n . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\u200b\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Sierra Wireless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-19-122-03) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
