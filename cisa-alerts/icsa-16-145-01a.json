[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryMoxa MiiNePort Vulnerabilities (Update A)========================================= Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-145\\-01AOVERVIEW-------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-16\\-145\\-01 Moxa MiiNePort Vulnerabilities that was published May 24, 2016, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site. Independent researcher Karn Ganeshen has identified weak credential management, sensitive information not protected, and cross\\-site request forgery vulnerabilities in Moxa\u2019s MiiNePort serial device server module series. Moxa will produce a beta patch firmware in late May 2016 to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following MiiNePort versions are affected:* MiiNePort\\_E1\\_7080 Firmware Version 1\\.1\\.10 Build 09120714,* MiiNePort\\_E1\\_4641 Firmware Version 1\\.1\\.10 Build 09120714,* MiiNePort\\_E2\\_1242 Firmware Version 1\\.1 Build 10080614,* MiiNePort\\_E2\\_4561 Firmware Version 1\\.1 Build 10080614, and* MiiNePort E3 Firmware Version 1\\.0 Build 11071409IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as password change, configuration parameter changes, saving modified configuration, and device reboot. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Moxa is a Taiwan\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, the UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil. The affected product, MiiNePort, is a serial device server module. According to Moxa, MiiNePort is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATIONCWE\\-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312\\.html, web site last accessed May 24, 2016\\.

Moxa indicates that users should ensure that Ports UDP/161 (SNMP), UDP/4800 (utility), and TCP/4900 (utility) are only accessible by trusted systems and that restricting access to Ports UDP/4800 and TCP/4900 will impact remote systems administration. Ensure the passwords have been enabled. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
