[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGE D60 Line Distance Relay========================== Last Revised February 15, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-046\\-02### **CVSS v3 9\\.8****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  GE**Equipment:**  D60 Line Distance Relay**Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory BufferAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of the D60 Line Distance Relay are affected:* D60 devices running firmware Version 7\\.11 and prior.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.MITIGATION---------- GE has released firmware that addresses the vulnerabilities. The latest firmware can be obtained from:[https://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod\\=d60\\&type\\=7](https://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod=d60&type=7)  Authentication will be required to download the firmware. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Multiple stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-5475](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-5475)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
