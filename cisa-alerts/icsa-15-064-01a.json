Siemens has produced an update for SINUMERIK that mitigates this vulnerability.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- \nSiemens has released an update for SIMATIC HMI Basic Panels.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\u00a0\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SINUMERIK and SIMATIC HMI Basic versions are affected:\n\nSINUMERIK 808D, 828D, 840D sl, all versions up to 4.7, and\nSIMATIC HMI Basic Panels 2nd Generation.\n\nThe following Ruggedcom APE versions are not vulnerable in their default configuration, but can become exploitable depending on components installed and user configuration:\nRuggedcom APE: APE1402-XX, APE1402-C01, APE1404-XX, APE1404-C01, all versions.\nIMPACT\nAn authenticated local user could cause a denial of service of the targeted system by exploiting this vulnerability.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected products, SINUMERIK, SIMATIC HMI Basic, and Ruggedcom, are used as an interface between operators and corresponding systems, as well as the ability to run third-party components. These products are deployed across several sectors including: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed March 05, 2015.\n\nIncorrect parsing within the glibc library functions \u201cgethostbyname()\u201d and \u201cgethostbyname2()\u201d could cause a denial of service of the targeted system.\nCVE-2015-0235NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0235, web site last accessed March 05, 2015.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed March 05, 2015.\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\nEXPLOITABILITY\nIn order to exploit the SINUMERIK and SIMATIC HMI Basic products, an attacker would first need to have authenticated local access to the device(s). To exploit the Ruggedcom APE product an attacker would need to be able to influence parameters passed to the vulnerable functions. This is only possible if the user has installed components that utilize the vulnerable functions and that are accessible to the attacker.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these products. However, public exploits for the \u201cGHOST\u201d vulnerability do exist.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with local access and a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has released security advisory SSA-994726 at the following location: http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nSiemens has provided updates for the following products and encourages customers to upgrade the products to the newest version:\n\nSINUMERIK Controllers \u2013 Contact your local Siemens account manager for the update.\n\n\nFor Version V2.7: update to V2.7 SP4 Hotfix 3\nFor Version V4.5: update to V4.5 SP4 Hotfix 4\nFor Version V4.7: update to V4.7 SP1\n\n\nRuggedcom APE: APE1402-XX, APE1402-C01, APE1404-XX, APE1404-C01, All versions. Upgrade information is available at:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/#document/109474273?lc=en-WW\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC HMI Basic Panels 2nd Generation\n\n\nSiemens has released an update and updated its security advisory SSA-994726. Please see the Siemens advisory for the update details.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed March 05, 2015. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed March 05, 2015. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
