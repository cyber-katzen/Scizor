EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network\nVendor: Sensormatic Electronics, LLC, an affiliate of Johnson Controls Inc.\nEquipment: Kantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader\nVulnerability: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nAn attacker with physical access to the Kantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader in certain circumstances can recover the reader's communication memory between the card and reader.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Kantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader are affected:\n\nKantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader: firmware versions prior to 1.7.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING RELEASE OF MEMORY AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE-401\nKantech Gen1 ioSmart card readers with firmware versions prior to 1.7.2 do not properly release memory after its effective lifetime. An attacker with physical access to the Kantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader in certain circumstances can recover the reader's communication memory between the card and reader. CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor also applies to this vulnerability.\nCVE-2023-0248\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nColin O'Flynn at NewAE Technology Inc. reported this vulnerability to Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users update their Kantech Gen1 ioSmart card reader firmware to\u00a0version 1.7.2\u00a0or higher.\nJohnson Controls also makes the following recommendations and wishes to provide the following information:\n\nContact technical support for additional information.\nioSmart Gen2 card readers are not affected by this vulnerability.\nUsers should contact their local sales representative for ordering information.\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory\u00a0JCI-PSA-2023-03 v1. Further ICS security notices and product security guidelines can also be found at this website.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nDecember 14, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
