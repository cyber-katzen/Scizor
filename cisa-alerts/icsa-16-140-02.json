A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.2\\.2 [INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE\\-200](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) The integrated web server (Port 80/TCP) of the affected devices could allow remote attackers to obtain a limited amount of device memory content if network access was obtained. This vulnerability only affects EN100 Ethernet module included in SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices.[CVE\\-2016\\-4785](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4785)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Energy* **Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Aleksandr Bersenev from HackerDom team and Pavel Toporkov from Kaspersky Lab reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens provides firmware update V4\\.27 for EN100 module included in SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact to fix the vulnerabilities. The firmware updates can be found at the following locations on the Siemens website:[http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec\\-4](http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-4) [http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec\\-compact](http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-compact)  For SIPROTEC Compact 7SJ80 with Ethernet Service Interface on Port A, Siemens provides firmware update V4\\.76\\. The firmware update can be found at the following location on the Siemens website:[http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec\\-compact](http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-compact)  An attacker must have network access to the affected devices. For remaining affected products, Siemens recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Siemens provides guidance at the following location for operating the devices only within trusted networks:<http://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity> For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-547990 at the following location:<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
