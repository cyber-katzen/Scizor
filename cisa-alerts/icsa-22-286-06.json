An improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command with root privileges during a restore operation exists; validation of file names included in the input package are missing. By restoring a specifically crafted package, a remote low-privileged attacker could execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the device, potentially leading to a full compromise.\nCVE-2022-40176 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. Endpoints of the \u201cOperation\u201d web application that interpret and execute Axon language queries allow file read access to the device file system with root privileges. By supplying specific input/output (I/O) related Axon queries, a remote low-privileged attacker could read sensitive files on the device.\nCVE-2022-40177 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION (\u2019CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING\u2019) CWE-79\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to improper neutralization of input during webpage generation in the \u201cImport Files\u201d functionality of the \u201cOperation\u201d web application, due to the missing validation of file titles included in the input package. By uploading a specifically crafted graphics package, a remote low-privileged attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\nCVE-2022-40178 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to a CSRF in endpoints of the \u201cOperation\u201d web application that interpret and execute Axon language queries, due to the missing validation of anti-CSRF tokens or other origin checks. By convincing a victim to click on a malicious link or visit a specifically crafted web page while logged-in to the device web application, a remote unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary Axon queries against the device.\nCVE-2022-40179 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to a CSRF in the \u201cImport Files\u201d functionality of the \u201cOperation\u201d web application due to the missing validation of anti-CSRF tokens or other origin checks. By convincing a victim to visit a specially crafted web page while logged-in to the device\u2019s web application, a remote unauthenticated attacker could upload and enable permanent arbitrary JavaScript code to the device.\nCVE-2022-40180 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ENCODED URI SCHEMES IN A WEB PAGE CWE-84\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to improper neutralization of encoded URL schemes in a web page. The device\u2019s embedded browser does not prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes when redirected to corresponding resources by web application code. By setting the homepage URI, the favorite URIs, or redirecting embedded browser users via JavaScript code to alternative scheme resources, a remote low privileged attacker could perform a range of attacks against the device, such as reading arbitrary files on the filesystem, executing arbitrary JavaScript code to steal or manipulate displayed information, or triggering denial-of-service conditions\nCVE-2022-40181 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXECUTION WITH UNNECESSARY PRIVILEGES CWE-250\nSiemens Desigo PXM Devices\u2019 webserver is vulnerable to execution with unnecessary privileges. The device launches the embedded Chromium-based browser as root with the \u201c\u2013no-sandbox\u201d option. Attackers could add arbitrary JavaScript code inside the \u201cOperation\u201d graphics and successfully exploit publicly known vulnerabilities against the version of the embedded Chromium-based browser.\nCVE-2022-40182 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4.

To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens Security Advisory in HTML or CSAF formats.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
