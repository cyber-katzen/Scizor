These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researcher Andrea Micalizzi (rgod). Tibbo has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nOne of the vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following AggreGate Platform versions are affected:\n\nAggreGate Platform Version 5.21.02 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nTibbo is a Taiwan-based company. Tibbo\u2019s partner network includes distributors, manufacturers, and integrators from more than 50 countries.\nThe affected product, AggreGate Platform, is an Internet of Things integration platform that employs network technologies to control, configure, monitor and service different electronic devices. According to Tibbo, the AggreGate Platform is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Tibbo estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPECWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html, web site last accessed November 19, 2015.\n\nThrough a servlet, it is possible to upload arbitrary Java code that allows application properties to be imported through uploaded files that could allow arbitrary code and command execution.\nCVE-2015-7912NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7912, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

By writing a Java file inside the application main root, it is possible to run arbitrary code and commands.\nCVE-2015-7913NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7913, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 19, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nOne of the vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nTibbo has released a new version of the AggreGate Platform, Version 5.30.06, to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. Tibbo\u2019s new version is available at the following URL:\nhttp://aggregate.tibbo.com/downloads.html.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
