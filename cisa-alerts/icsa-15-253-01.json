Yokogawa\u2019s Security Advisory Report, YSAR\\-15\\-0003 Vulnerabilities of Communication Functions in CENTUM, and other YOKOGAWA products are available at the following URL: http://www.yokogawa.com/dcs/security/ysar/dcs\\-ysar\\-index\\-en.htm For additional information about the vulnerabilities and to obtain Yokogawa\u2019s product revisions, contact Yokogawa via its Security web site at: https://plus.yokogawa.co.jp/gw/gw.po?c\\-id\\=000498 Yokogawa offers the following recommendations to minimize the risk associated with these vulnerabilities by applying the actions: Apply properly configured firewall between the external network and control system network to prevent external communication with the affected devices. Prevent unapproved devices from being connected to the network where vulnerable products are connected. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
