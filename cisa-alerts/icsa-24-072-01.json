EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: EcoStruxure Power Design\nVulnerability: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow for arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Schneider Electric - EcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial, an equipment management platform, are affected:\n\nEcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial NL: All Versions\nEcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial INT: All Versions\nEcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial FR: All Versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nAll versions of Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial NL, INT, and FR deserializes untrusted data which could allow an attacker to perform code execution when a malicious project file is loaded into the application by a valid user.\nCVE-2024-2229\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities, Information Technology, Healthcare and Public Health, Critical Manufacturing, Transportation Systems, Energy, Chemical\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology) of Summoning Team (@SummoningTeam) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions of EcoStruxture Power Design - Ecodial that will include a fix for this vulnerability. Until then, customers should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:\n\nCompute hash of the project files and regularly check the consistency of this hash to verify the integrity before usage.\nStore the hash information in a separate location from where the project file is stored.\nWhen sharing or receiving project files with another user, the hash information should be provided over a separate, out of band channel.\nWhen exchanging files over the network, use secure communication protocols.\nOnly open project files received from a trusted source.\nHarden the workstation running the application.\nDelete the accounts of people who no longer need access to the application and the computer running the application following the principle of least privilege.\n\nTo ensure you are informed of all updates, including details on affected products and remediation plans, subscribe to\u00a0Schneider Electric's security notification service.\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices.\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\nPlace all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode.\nNever connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\nScan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nNever allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric\u00a0Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices\u00a0document.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nMarch 12, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
