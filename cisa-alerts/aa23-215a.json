Proof of concept (PoC) code was publicly available for many of the software vulnerabilities or vulnerability chains, likely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of malicious cyber actors.\n \n\n\n\n Malicious cyber actors generally have the most success exploiting known vulnerabilities within the first two years of public disclosure\u2014the value of such vulnerabilities gradually decreases as software is patched or upgraded. Timely patching reduces the effectiveness of known, exploitable vulnerabilities, possibly decreasing the pace of malicious cyber actor operations and forcing pursuit of more costly and time\\-consuming methods (such as developing zero\\-day exploits or conducting software supply chain operations).\n \n\n\n\n Malicious cyber actors likely prioritize developing exploits for severe and globally prevalent CVEs. While sophisticated actors also develop tools to exploit other vulnerabilities, developing exploits for critical, wide\\-spread, and publicly known vulnerabilities gives actors low\\-cost, high\\-impact tools they can use for several years. Additionally, cyber actors likely give higher priority to vulnerabilities that are more prevalent in their specific targets\u2019 networks. Multiple CVE or CVE chains require the actor to send a malicious web request to the vulnerable device, which often includes unique signatures that can be detected through deep packet inspection.\n \n\n\n#### **Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities**\n\n\n\n Table 1 shows the top 12 vulnerabilities the co\\-authors observed malicious cyber actors routinely exploiting in 2022:\n \n\n\n* [**CVE\\-2018\\-13379**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379 \"CVE-2018-13379\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability, affecting Fortinet SSL VPNs, was also\n [routinely exploited in 2020](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-209a \"Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities\") \n and\n [2021](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-117a \"2021 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities\") \n . The continued exploitation indicates that many organizations failed to patch software in a timely manner and remain vulnerable to malicious cyber actors.\n* [**CVE\\-2021\\-34473**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34473 \"CVE-2021-34473\")\n**,** \n[**CVE\\-2021\\-31207**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31207 \"CVE-2021-31207\")\n**,** \n[**CVE\\-2021\\-34523**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34523 \"CVE-2021-34523\")\n**.** \n These vulnerabilities, known as ProxyShell, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. In combination, successful exploitation enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code. These vulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which typically runs on port 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g., Microsoft\u2019s web server). CAS is commonly exposed to the internet to enable users to access their email via mobile devices and web browsers.\n* [**CVE\\-2021\\-40539**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40539 \"CVE-2021-40539\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and was linked to the usage of an outdated third\\-party dependency. Initial exploitation of this vulnerability\n [began in late 2021](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-259a \"APT Actors Exploiting Newly Identified Vulnerability in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus\") \n and\n [continued throughout 2022](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/06/2003092365/-1/-1/0/Joint_CSA_Top_CVEs_Exploited_by_PRC_cyber_actors_.PDF \"Top CVEs Actively Exploited By People\u2019s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors\") \n .\n* [**CVE\\-2021\\-26084**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084 \"CVE-2021-26084\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center (a web\\-based collaboration tool used by governments and private companies) could enable an unauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. This vulnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited vulnerabilities after a PoC was released within a week of its disclosure. Attempted mass exploitation of this vulnerability was observed in September 2021\\.\n* [**CVE\\-2021\\- 44228**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228 \"CVE-2021-44228\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apache\u2019s Log4j library, an open\\-source logging framework incorporated into thousands of products worldwide. An actor can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system, causing the execution of arbitrary code. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control of a system. The actor can then steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other malicious activity.\n [\\[1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) \n ] Malicious cyber actors began exploiting the vulnerability after it was publicly disclosed in December 2021, and continued to show high interest in CVE\\-2021\\- 44228 through the first half of 2022\\.\n* [**CVE\\-2022\\-22954**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22954 \"CVE-2022-22954\")\n ,\n [**CVE\\-2022\\-22960**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22960 \"CVE-2022-22960\")\n**.** \n These vulnerabilities allow RCE, privilege escalation, and authentication bypass in VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and other VMware products. A malicious cyber actor with network access could trigger a server\\-side template injection that may result in remote code execution\n **.** \n Exploitation of CVE\\-2022\\-22954 and CVE\\-2022\\-22960\n [began in early 2022](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-138b \"Threat Actors Chaining Unpatched VMware Vulnerabilities for Full System Control\") \n and attempts continued throughout the remainder of the year.\n* [**CVE\\-2022\\-1388**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1388 \"CVE-2022-1388\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability allows unauthenticated malicious cyber actors to bypass iControl REST authentication\n \n on F5 BIG\\-IP application delivery and security software\n **.**\n* [**CVE\\-2022\\-30190**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30190 \"CVE-2022-30190\")\n**.** \n This vulnerability impacts the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) in Windows.

This critical RCE vulnerability affects Atlassian Confluence and Data Center. The vulnerability, which was likely initially exploited as a zero\\-day before public disclosure in June 2022, is related to an older Confluence vulnerability (\n [CVE\\-2021\\-26084](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084 \"CVE-2021-26084\") \n ), which cyber actors also exploited in 2022\\.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Top 12 Routinely Exploited

default:\n \n\n\n* **Identify repeatedly exploited classes of vulnerability.** \n Perform an analysis of both CVEs and known exploited vulnerabilities to understand which classes of vulnerability are identified more than others. Implement appropriate mitigations to eliminate those classes of vulnerability. For example, if a product has several instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities, ensure all database queries in the product use parameterized queries, and prohibit other forms of queries.\n* **Ensure business leaders are responsible for security.** \n Business leaders should ensure that proactive steps to eliminate entire classes of security vulnerabilities, rather than only making one\\-off patches when new vulnerabilities are discovered.\n* **Follow the SSDF** \n (\n [SP 800\\-218](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final \"NIST SP 800-218\") \n\n )\n \n and implement secure design practices into each stage of the SDLC.

These mitigations align with the cross\\-sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures.

For patch information on CVEs identified in this CSA, refer to the appendix.\n\t+ If a patch for a known exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied, implement vendor\\-approved workarounds.\n\t+ Replace end\\-of\\-life software (i.e., software no longer supported by the vendor).\n* **Routinely perform automated asset discovery** \n across the entire estate to identify and catalogue all the systems, services, hardware and software.\n* **Implement a robust patch management process** \n and centralized patch management system that establishes prioritization of patch applications \\[\n [CPG 1\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n\t+ Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet\\-facing systems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service providers (CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs). Reputable MSPs can patch applications\u2014such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other employee collaboration tools\u2014for their customers. However, MSPs and CSPs can expand their customer\u2019s attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, so organizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly reduce risk \\[\n\t [CPG 1\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].
