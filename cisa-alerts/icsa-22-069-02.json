A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER VALIDATION OF SPECIFIED QUANTITY IN INPUT CWE\\-1284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html) The affected product is vulnerable when the total length of an ICMP payload (set in the IP header) is unchecked. This may lead to various side effects, including information leak and denial\\-of\\-service conditions, depending on the network buffer organization in memory.[CVE\\-2021\\-31346](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-31346)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [INTEGER UNDERFLOW (WRAP OR WRAPAROUND) CWE\\-191](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/191.html) The affected product is vulnerable to a malformed TCP packet with a corrupted SACK option, which could lead to information leaks and denial\\-of\\-service conditions.[CVE\\-2021\\-31889](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-31889)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER HANDLING OF INCONSISTENT STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS CWE\\-240](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/240.html) The affected product is vulnerable when the total length of a TCP payload (set in the IP header) is unchecked. This may lead to various side effects, including information leak and denial\\-of\\-service conditions, depending on the network buffer organization in memory.[CVE\\-2021\\-31890](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-31890)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Update to [v5\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109778383/simotics-connect-400-firmware-version-1-0-0-0?dti=0&lc=en-WW)* Update to [v1\\.0\\.0\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109778383/) As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-223353](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-223353.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
