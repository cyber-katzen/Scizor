Moxa has produced new firmware to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMoxa reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n\nOnCell G3100V2 Series, editions prior to Version 2.8, and\nOnCell G3111/G3151/G3211/G3251 Series, editions prior to Version 1.7\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication to log in as a valid user.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMoxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.\nThe affected products, OnCell 31XX and 32XX series devices, are cellular IP gateways that can connect serial or Ethernet devices to a cellular network. According to Moxa, OnCell IP gateways are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that these products are used primarily in Asia and Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTSCWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html, web site last accessed August 23, 2016.\n\nAn attacker can freely use brute force to determine parameters needed to bypass authentication.\nCVE-2016-5799NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5799, web site last accessed August 30, 2016. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed August 23, 2016.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, web site last accessed August 30, 2016.\n\nThe reflected cross-site scripting attack may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the user\u2019s browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.\nCVE-2016-5819NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5819 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, web site last accessed August 30, 2016.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nMoxa has made firmware fixes available on their web site at the following locations:\nhttp://www.moxa.com/support/sarch_result.aspx?type=soft&prod_id=316&type_id=4\nhttp://www.moxa.com/support/sarch_result.aspx?type=soft&prod_id=416&type_id=4\nMoxa offers the following advice for upgrading firmware:\nThe OnCell G3111/G3151-HSPA\u2019s firmware can be upgraded though the web console, serial console, or through OnCell Search Utility. However, Moxa recommends a local (LAN) connection to the OnCell to minimize the risk of a broken connection during the upgrade process. If you have made any changes to your configuration, remember to save the configuration first before upgrading the firmware. Any unsaved changes will be discarded when the firmware is upgraded. To upgrade the firmware, simply browse to the location of the firmware on your PC, and select Submit.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
