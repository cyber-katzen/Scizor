EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.1*** ATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit* Vendor: Mitsubishi Electric* Equipment: Mitsubishi Electric FR Configurator2* Vulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may enable arbitrary files to be read or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Mitsubishi FR Configurator2, used for configuring Mitsubishi variable frequency drives, are affected:* FR Configurator2 Version 1\\.16S and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE\\-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)#### This vulnerability is triggered when input passed to the XML parser is not sanitized while parsing the XML project and/or template file (.frc2\\). Once a user opens the file, the attacker could read arbitrary files.[CVE\\-2019\\-10976](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10976)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)#### This vulnerability can be triggered when an attacker provides the target with a rogue project file (.frc2\\). Once a user opens the rogue project, CPU exhaustion occurs, which causes the software to quit responding until the application is restarted.[CVE\\-2019\\-10972](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10972)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Applied Risk reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\.
