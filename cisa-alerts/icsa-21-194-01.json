EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: C-Bus Toolkit\nVulnerability: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable remote access to the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of C-Bus Toolkit are affected:\n\nC-Bus Toolkit Versions 1.15.8 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAn improper authentication issue exists and could allow an attacker to use a crafted webpage that can enable remote access to the system.\nCVE-2021-22784 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nrgod working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric recommends users to update to Version 1.15.9 or later. Note: A reboot will be needed after the update.\nIf users are unable to update, Schneider Electric recommends the following workarounds:\n\nUse an allow list for this application\nTurn on the computer\u2019s firewall\nUse an antivirus program\nSecure the computer to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the computer\n\nSee Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification SEVD-2021-194-04 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n\u00a0\n",
