[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryOFFIS DCMTK=========== Last Revised June 23, 2022 Alert Code ICSMA\\-22\\-174\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable from an adjacent network/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  OFFIS* **Equipment:**  DCMTK* **Vulnerabilities:**  Path Traversal, Relative Path Traversal, NULL Pointer Dereference2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, write malformed DICOM files into arbitrary directories, and gain remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of DCMTK, libraries and software that process DICOM image files, are affected:* DCMTK: All versions prior to 3\\.6\\.7### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) The affected product\u2019s service class provider (SCP) is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to write DICOM files into arbitrary directories under controlled names. This could allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-2119](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2119)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE\\-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html) The affected product\u2019s service class user (SCU) is vulnerable to relative path traversal, allowing an attacker to write DICOM files into arbitrary directories under controlled names. This could allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-2120](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2120)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html) The affected product has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability while processing DICOM files, which may result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-2121](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2121)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Noam Moshe of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- OFFIS recommends all users update to [Version 3\\.6\\.7](https://www.dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en)  or later. For more information see [Bug \\#1021](https://support.dcmtk.org/redmine/issues/1021)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
