EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/public exploits are available\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: Lumada Asset Performance Manager (APM)\nVulnerabilities: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, Code injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the Prognostic Model Executor and could allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Lumada Asset Performance Manager with the Prognostic Model Executor Service enabled are affected:\n\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) online service (SaaS) version 6.3.220323.0 and prior\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.0.0.0 to 6.0.0.4\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.1.0.0 and 6.1.0.1\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.2.0.0 to 6.2.0.2\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.3.0.0 to 6.3.0.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0 \u00a0 ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE-770\nA vulnerability exists in the Spring Framework component included in the Prognostic Model Executor service of the affected product. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted data or configuration to the application either directly or via integrated applications, causing the Prognostic Model Executor service to fail.\nCVE-2022-22950 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0 \u00a0 IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nA vulnerability in the Spring Framework component included in the Prognostic Model Executor service could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code for remote code execution.\nCVE-2022-22965 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy recommends applying the most recent patch version of Lumada Asset Performance Management (APM) or upgrading to a newer, unaffected major version:\n\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.0.0.0 to 6.0.0.4: Apply patch version 6.0.0.5 or upgrade to 6.2.0.3\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.1.0.0 and 6.1.0.1: Apply patch version 6.1.0.2 or upgrade to 6.2.0.3\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.2.0.0 to 6.2.0.2: Apply patch version 6.2.0.4 or upgrade to 6.4.0.0\nLumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) versions 6.3.0.0 to 6.3.0.2: Apply patch version 6.3.0.3 or upgrade to 6.4.0.0\n\nNote: For Lumada Asset Performance Manager (APM) online service (SaaS) version 6.3.220323.0 and prior, Hitachi Energy has already updated all SaaS environments.\nFor additional information, support and to upgrade users should contact Hitachi Energy.\nHitachi Energy recommends disabling the Prognostic Model Executor service if users cannot upgrade to the latest patch version.\nUsers should be aware that disabling the Prognostic Model Executor service will have the following impact:\n\nDisabling the Prognostic Model Executor service will cause the Lumada APM application to stop performing condition assessment calculations (for all assets configured to use prognostic models) and to accumulate calculation requests in the internal messaging queue. As the requests in the queue have a limited lifetime (set by messaging bus topic retention), when that lifetime expires, the request will be lost.\nWhen the Prognostic Model Executor service is restored to function (after applying the suggested remediation steps and according to the installation guide) it will start processing the accumulated requests. When the period of accumulation is long, this may result in a prolonged period of intensive calculations.\nIf any requests were lost, the affected assets may be missing historical or even current condition assessments. To ensure the current assessments are up to date, the customer should trigger recalculation of condition of all assets using the performance models.\n\nHitachi Energy also recommends following the least privilege principle by limiting and controlling access to the \u201cAdministrator\u201d role or \u201cImport\u201d role privileges in the application programmable interface (API).\nFor more information, users should see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000105.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThese vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n",
