EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: Magelis HMI Panel\nVulnerability: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of the Magelis HMI Panels are affected:\n\nMagelis HMIGTO series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMISTO series, all firmware versions\nMagelis XBTGH series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMIGTU series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMIGTUX series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMISCU series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMISTU series, all firmware versions\nMagelis XBTGT series, all firmware versions\nMagelis XBTGC series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMIGXO series, all firmware versions\nMagelis HMIGXU series, all firmware versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CHECK FOR UNUSUAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE-754\nWhen the device receives a high rate of frames, the HMI may temporarily freeze. When the attack stops, the buffered commands are processed by the HMI.\nCVE-2019-6833 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThe VAPT Team, C3i Center, IIT Kanpur, India, reported this vulnerability to Schneider Electric.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric recommends users set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Ports 44818/TCP, 502/TCP, 6000/TCP, 6002/TCP, 8080/TCP, 8014/TCP, and 6001/TCP.\nFor more information, see the Schneider Electric security notification.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
