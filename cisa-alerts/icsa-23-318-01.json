EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: Operations Control Logger\nVulnerabilities: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges, External Control of File Name or Path\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow privilege escalation or denial of service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAVEVA has created a security update to address vulnerabilities in the AVEVA Operations Control Logger (formerly known as ArchestrA Logger), impacting the following products:\n\nAVEVA SystemPlatform: 2020 R2 SP1 P01 and prior\nAVEVA Historian: 2020 R2 SP1 P01 and prior\nAVEVA Application Server: 2020 R2 SP1 P01 and prior\nAVEVA InTouch: 2020 R2 SP1 P01 and prior\nAVEVA Enterprise Licensing (formerly known as License Manager): version 3.7.002 and prior\nAVEVA Manufacturing Execution System (formerly known as Wonderware MES): 2020 P01 and prior\nAVEVA Recipe Management: 2020 R2 Update 1 Patch 2 and prior\nAVEVA Batch Management: 2020 SP1 and prior\nAVEVA Edge (formerly known as Indusoft Web Studio): 2020 R2 SP1 P01 and prior\nAVEVA Worktasks (formerly known as Workflow Management): 2020 U2 and prior\nAVEVA Plant SCADA (formerly known as Citect): 2020 R2 Update 15 and prior\nAVEVA Mobile Operator (formerly known as IntelaTrac Mobile Operator Rounds): 2020 R1 and prior\nAVEVA Communication Drivers Pack: 2020 R2 SP1 and prior\nAVEVA Telemetry Server: 2020 R2 SP1 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Execution with Unnecessary Privileges CWE-250\nThis privilege escalation vulnerability, if exploited, cloud allow a local OS-authenticated user with standard privileges to escalate to System privilege on the machine where these products are installed, resulting in complete compromise of the target machine.\nCVE-2023-33873\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0External Control of File Name or Path CWE-73\nThis external control vulnerability, if exploited, could allow a local OS-authenticated user with standard privileges to delete files with System privilege on the machine where these products are installed, resulting in denial of service.\nCVE-2023-34982\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nLukasz Piotrowski from Equinor reported these vulnerabilities to AVEVA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Users of affected products should apply security updates as soon as possible.\nIn addition to applying security updates, users should follow these general precautions:\n\nEnsure that Guest or Anonymous local OS accounts are disabled.\nEnsure that only trusted users are able to login on the nodes where the\u00a0Operations Control Logger is running.\n\nPlease see\u00a0AVEVA Security Bulletin number AVEVA-2023-003\u00a0for more information and for links for individual security updates and mitigations for each of the affected products.\nAVEVA System Platform 2020 through 2020 R2 SP1 cannot be newly installed on top of other AVEVA products which have been previously patched with the Operations Control Logger v22.1. For additional details please refer to\u00a0Alert 000038736.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nExercise principles of least privilege.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nNovember 14, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
