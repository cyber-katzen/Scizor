ICS\\-CERT has worked with the reseacher and Ecava to validate these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n Ecava has developed a patch release of IntegraXor to address these vulnerabilities. The independent security reseacher has validated this patch.\n \n\n\nAffected Products\n-----------------\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilites affect all IntegraXor versions prior to Version 3\\.60 (Build 4080\\).\n \n\n\nImpact\n------\n\n\n\n A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary data leakage. The impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\n\n[Ecava Sdn Bhd](http://www.ecava.com/index.htm) \n is a Malaysia\\-based software development company that provides the IntegraXor product. Ecava specializes in factory and process automation solutions.\n \n\n\n\n IntegraXor is a suite of tools used to create and run a web\\-based human\\-machine interface for a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.\n \n\n\n\n IntegraXor is currently used in several areas of process control in 38 countries, with the largest installation base residing in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Poland, Canada, and Estonia.\n \n\n\nVulnerability Characterization\n------------------------------\n\n\n### Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n IntegraXor is vulnerable to a reflective (nonpersistent)\n [Cross Site Scripting vulnerability](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html) \n . An attacker may craft a custom URL that executes an arbitrary script. Using this vulnerability, an attacker injects malicious code directly into the user's browsing session. Parameters are passed back to the user without being properly sanitized.\n \n\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\n\n#### Exploitability\n\n\n\n Successful exploit of this vulnerability requires interaction by the user making the request. Modern web browsers have protection mechanisms against such attacks making this exploit more difficult to execute.\n \n\n\n#### Existence of Exploit\n\n\n\n Tools are publicly available that aid in exploiting this cross\\-site scripting vulnerability.\n \n\n\n#### Difficulty\n\n\n\n An attacker needs moderate skill level to exploit this vulnerability.\n \n\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT recommends that users of Ecava IntegraXor take the following mitigation steps:\n \n\n\n* Update IntegraXor to the latest version and install the latest patch 3\\.60 (Build 4080\\).\n   \n\n  \n\n Ecava has developed and released a\n [patch](http://www.integraxor.com/download/igsetup.msi) \n to mitigate the vulnerability.\n   \n\n  \n\n For more information, customers can contact Ecava support at\n [support@integraxor.com](mailto:support@integraxor.com) \n . Ecava\u2019s security notes can be found at\n [http://www.integraxor.com/blog/category/security](http://http://www.integraxor.com/blog/category/security) \n .\n* ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n Organizations should follow their established internal procedures if any suspected malicious activity is observed and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations that proper impact analysis and risk assessment should be performed prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the US\\-CERT website. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including\n [*Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html)\n .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Ecava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-11-147-02) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
