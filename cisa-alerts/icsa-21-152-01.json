A remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to Port 102/TCP could write arbitrary data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks.[CVE\\-2020\\-15782](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15782)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Tal Keren from Claroty reported this vulnerability to Siemens.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2: [Update to v21\\.9 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109759122/)* SIMATIC S7\\-1500 Software Controller: [Update to v21\\.9 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478528/)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SIMATIC Drive Controller family: [Update to v2\\.9\\.2 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773914/)* SIMATIC S7\\-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants): [Update to v4\\.5\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793280/)* SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): [Update to v2\\.9\\.2 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478459/)* SIMATIC S7\\-PLCSIM Advanced: [Update to v4\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109795016/) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply password protection for S7 communication.* Disallow client connections via the ENDIS\\_PW instruction of the S7\\-1200 or S7\\-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password).* Use the display to configure additional access protection of the S7\\-1500 CPU (This blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password).* Apply \u201cdefense in depth\u201d as outlined on pages 12ff of the operational guidelines for industrial security, especially:\t+ **Plant security:** \t Ensure physical prevention of access to critical components.\t+ **Network security:** \t Ensure PLC systems are not connected to untrusted networks.\t+ **System integrity:** \t Configure, maintain, and protect devices by applying applicable compensating controls and using built\\-in security capabilities.* Update the entire solution to TIA Portal v17 and use TLS communication using individual certificates between PLC, HMIs, and PG/PC For more information about this vulnerability and the associated mitigations, please see [SSA\\-434534](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-434534.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
