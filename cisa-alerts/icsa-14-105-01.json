Progea has produced a new version that mitigates this vulnerability. The researcher has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Progea Movicon versions are affected:\n\nProgea Movicon 11.4 prior to Build 1150.\n\nIMPACT\nThe service of the software allows download and upload of files. Some opcode functions could be triggered remotely to release limited information such as OS version information.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nProgea Srl\u00a0is an Italian-based company.\nThe affected product, Progea Movicon 11, is an XML-based human-machine interface development system that includes drivers for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Movicon provides OPC-based connectivity for data transfer, including OPC DA and OPC XML DA services. According to Progea, Movicon is deployed across several critical infrastructure sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems.\nProgea estimates that this product is used primarily in Europe, India, and the United States.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINFORMATION DISCLOSURECWE-200: Information Exposure, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\n\nTCPUploader module listens on Port 10651/TCP for incoming connections. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated user access to release OS version information. While this is a minor vulnerability, it represents a method for further network reconnaissance.\nCVE-2014-0778NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0778, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nProgea has updated and fixed the vulnerability in Movicon Version 11.4.1150. This is available as a download from the Progea Technical Support site:\nhttp://www.progea.com/it-it/downloads/software.aspx.\nUsers will be required to register on the Progea web site to download this new version.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
