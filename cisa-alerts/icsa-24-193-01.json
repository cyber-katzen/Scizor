RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of service condition, learn vulnerable credentials, escalate privileges, modify users outside of scope, gain access to participant groups, use temporary credentials for authentication bypass, or execute arbitrary code.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following products of Siemens, are affected:\n \n\n\n* Siemens SINEMA Remote Connect Server: All versions prior to V3\\.2 SP1\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**INCORRECT USER MANAGEMENT CWE\\-286**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/286.html)\n\n\n\n The affected application creates temporary user credentials for UMC (User Management Component) users. An attacker could use these temporary credentials for authentication bypass in certain scenarios.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-32260](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-32260) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.2** \n[**UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE\\-434**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)\n\n\n\n The affected application allows users to upload encrypted backup files. As part of this backup, files can be restored without correctly checking the path of the restored file. This could allow an attacker with access to the backup encryption key to upload malicious files, that could potentially lead to remote code execution.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2024\\-39865](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-39865) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* SINEMA Remote Connect Server: Update to V3\\.2 SP1 or later version\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-381581 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-381581.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-381581.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n \n\n\n5\\.
