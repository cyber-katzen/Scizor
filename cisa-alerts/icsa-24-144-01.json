MITIGATIONS--------------- AutomationDirect recommends that users:* Update the Productivity Suite programming software to version 4\\.2\\.0\\.x or higher.* Update Productivity PLC's firmware to the [latest version.](https://www.automationdirect.com/support/software-downloads) Although Automation Networks and Systems come equipped with built\\-in password protection mechanisms, this represents a fraction of the security measures needed to safeguard these systems. It is imperative that Automation Control System Networks integrate data protection and security measures that match, if not exceed, the robustness of conventional business computer systems. AutomationDirect advises users of PLCs, HMI products, and SCADA systems to conduct a thorough network security analysis to ascertain the appropriate level of security necessary for their specific application. AutomationDirect has identified the following mitigation for instances where systems cannot be upgraded to latest version:* Physically disconnect the PLC from any external networks, including the internet, local area networks (LANs), and other interconnected systems.* Configure network segmentation to isolate PLC from other devices and systems withing the organization.* Implement firewall rules or network access control (NAC) policies to block incoming and outgoing traffic to the PLC. Please refer to the following link for supporting information related to security considerations. <https://support.automationdirect.com/docs/securityconsiderations.pdf> If you have any questions regarding this issue, please contact AutomationDirect Technical Support at 770\\-844\\-4200 or 800\\-633\\-0405 for further assistance. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
