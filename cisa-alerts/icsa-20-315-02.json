EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: OSIsoft\nEquipment: PI Vision 2020\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, Incorrect Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker with write access to the PI ProcessBook files to inject code that is imported into PI Vision, or disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll versions prior to PI Vision 2020 are affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA remote attacker with write access to PI ProcessBook files could inject code that is imported into PI Vision. Unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or deletion is also possible if a victim views or interacts with the infected display. This vulnerability affects PI System data and other data accessible with victim\u2019s user permissions.\nCVE-2020-25163 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\nPI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute.\nCVE-2020-25167 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nOSIsoft reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOSIsoft released PI Vision 2020 Version 3.5.0, which resolves these vulnerabilities.\nRecommended defensive measures and related configuration settings are described on the OSIsoft customer portal (Login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
