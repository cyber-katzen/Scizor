Siemens produced a new firmware version that mitigates this vulnerability and then reported it to NCCIC/ICS-CERT.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU versions are affected:\n\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU all versions before V1.6\n\nIMPACT\nA successful exploit of this vulnerability will cause the CPU to automatically restart and remain in the \u201cSTOP\u201d mode. The CPU would then need to be manually put into the \u201cRUN\u201d mode to restore operations.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nProducts in the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 PLC family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nNUMERIC ERRORSCWE-189: Numeric Errors , http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/189.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2014.\n\nSpecially crafted TCP packets could cause a DoS of the device if sent in a specific order.\nCVE-2014-5074NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5074, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C.CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed August 13, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nThe firmware update for S7-1500 V1.6 can be obtained at the following location on the Siemens web site:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=cslib.csinfo&lang=en&objid=98164677&caller=view\nSiemens recommends running the affected software components in a protected network environment and to configure the environment according to operational guidelines.Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/Documents/operational_guidelines_industrial_security_en.pdf, web site last accessed August 13, 2014.\nFor more information regarding this issue (SSA-310688) or any other security issue involving Siemens products, please see the Siemens ProductCERT security advisory page at:\nwww.siemens.com/cert/advisories.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
