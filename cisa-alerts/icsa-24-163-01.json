EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 8\\.3*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Rockwell Automation* **Equipment**  : ControlLogix, GuardLogix, CompactLogix* **Vulnerability**  : Always\\-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could compromise the availability of the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Rockwell Automation reports that the following controllers are affected:* ControlLogix 5580: V34\\.011* GuardLogix 5580: V34\\.011* 1756\\-EN4: V4\\.001* CompactLogix 5380: V34\\.011* Compact GuardLogix 5380: V34\\.011* CompactLogix 5480: V34\\.011### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**Always\\-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation CWE\\-670**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/670.html) Rockwell Automation was made aware of a vulnerability that causes all affected controllers on the same network to result in a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF/Assert). This vulnerability could be exploited by sending abnormal packets to the mDNS port. If exploited, the availability of the device would be compromised.[CVE\\-2024\\-5659](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-5659)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2024\\-5659](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-5659)  . A base score of 8\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation offers users the following solutions:* ControlLogix 5580: corrected in V34\\.014, V35\\.013, V36\\.011 and later* GuardLogix 5580: corrected in V34\\.014, V35\\.013, V36\\.011 and later* 1756\\-EN4: corrected in V6\\.001 and later* CompactLogix 5380: corrected in V34\\.014, V35\\.013, V36\\.011 and later* Compact GuardLogix 5380: corrected in V34\\.014, V35\\.013, V36\\.011 and later* CompactLogix 5480: corrected in V34\\.014, V35\\.013, V36\\.011 and later Rockwell Automation encourages users of the affected software, who are not able to upgrade to one of the corrected versions, to apply the risk mitigations where possible.* Users who do not use Automatic Policy Deployment (APD) should block mDNS port, 5353 to help prevent communication.* Enable CIP Security. [CIP Security with Rockwell Automation Products Application Technique](https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/at/secure-at001_-en-p.pdf)* [Security Best Practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US#__highlight) For more information, see [Rockwell Automation's security advisory](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/trust-center/security-advisories.html)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
