MITIGATIONS--------------- Yokogawa recommends the following:* Users of CENTUM Versions R6\\.01\\.10 through R6\\.09\\.00: Update to R6\\.09\\.00 and apply patch software (R6\\.09\\.04\\). In an environment where the AD server and Plant Resource Manager (PRM) are linked, there are some precautions to be taken when applying patch software (R6\\.09\\.04\\). Please be sure to check R6\\.09\\.04 install manual for details before applying R6\\.09\\.04* Users of CENTUM Versions R4\\.01\\.00 though R4\\.03\\.00: No patch software will be available because these products are no longer supported by the vendor.* B/M9000 VP: This product is not affected by these vulnerabilities. However, this product is affected by the existence of CENTUM installed on the same PC. If CENTUM is installed, perform update, and update B/M9000 to suitable revision.* Users of Prosafe\\-RS: Update to R4\\.07\\.02 or later Yokogawa also recommends checking the patch software install manual for details before applying patch software as there are some precautions for the following:* The environment where both CENTUM VP and ProSafe\\-RS are installed.* The environment where CENTUM VP\u2019s AD server and PRM are linked.* The environment where ProSafe\\-RS\u2019s AD server and PRM are linked.

Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
