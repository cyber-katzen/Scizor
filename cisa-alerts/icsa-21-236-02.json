For more information on this advisory, see the [Hitachi ABB Power Grids security advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107992A5821&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  or [contact Hitachi ABB Power Grids](https://www.hitachiabb-powergrids.com/contact-us/)  . Hitachi ABB Power Grids suggests \u00a0recommended security practices, operating systems hardening, and firewall configurations can help protect a user\u2019s computer from the attacks. An entry point for this vulnerability is the unsecured operating system on which the product is installed. Hitachi ABB Power Grids recommends hardening the operating system accordingly.* Follow the [hardening guidelines](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/)  published by The Center for Internet Security (CIS).* Routinely monitor the application process log for unrecognized user sessions originating from outside the application. For additional information, please see the following Hitachi ABB Power Grids security advisories:* [Retail Operations](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107992A5821&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)* [Counterparty Settlement Billing (CSB)](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107992A5933&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch) CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
