Users can find the latest firmware version by selecting their device at the following web site:\nhttp://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID=15\nAdditional precautions and risk mitigation strategies specific to these types of attacks are recommended in the Rockwell Automation security release. When possible, multiple strategies should be implemented simultaneously.\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/942592\nPlease also refer to Cisco\u2019s security advisories for additional workarounds and details for these vulnerabilities:\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-aaados\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-msdp\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-dns\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-smi\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
