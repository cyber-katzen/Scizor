Siemens is preparing updates for the affected products.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n\nSiemens PET/CT Systems: All Windows XP-based versions,\nSiemens SPECT/CT Systems: All Windows XP-based versions,\nSiemens SPECT Systems: All Windows XP-based versions, and\nSiemens SPECT Workplaces/Symbia.net: All Windows XP-based versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment and specific clinical usage.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected products, Select Molecular Imaging products, are used in medical imaging. According to Siemens, Molecular Imaging products are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sector. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION')CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html, web site last accessed August 03, 2017.\n\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted remote procedure call (RPC) request sent to the server service of affected Microsoft Windows systems.\nCVE-2008-4250NVD, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-4250, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed August 03, 2017.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens is preparing updates for the affected products and recommends protecting network access to the Molecular Imaging products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to run the devices in a dedicated network segment and protected IT environment. If this is not possible, Siemens recommends the following:\n\nIf patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the product from the network and use in standalone mode.\nReconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system. Siemens is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore users of RUH-capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to reconnect the systems in order to receive patches as quickly as possible via RUH. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.\n\nIn addition, Siemens recommends:\n\nEnsure users have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.\nFor specific patch and remediation guidance information contact a local Siemens customer service engineer or a Siemens regional support center.\n\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-814457 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all medical devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
