MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends applying the available security patch or updating LinkOne to v3\\.27\\. [Contact Hitachi Energy](https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us)  for more information on applying the security patch or updating LinkOne to v3\\.27 Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect the application from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include physically protecting the application from direct access by unauthorized personnel, having no direct connections to the Internet. For the end\\-user of the application, it is recommended to use the latest browser when accessing the LinkOne application. For more information, review Hitachi Energy\u2019s security advisory [8DBD000079](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000079&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  Additional recommendation is to follow the hardening guidelines published by The [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/)  to protect the host Operating System on which the LinkOne is hosted. For additional information and support please contact your product provider or [Hitachi Energy service](https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.
