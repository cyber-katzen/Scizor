MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users update to [v1\\.5\\.0 or later](https://sivms.cloud/control-center-server-ccs/)  . Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* General (applies to all vulnerabilities listed in this advisory) \u2013 Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the CCS server to ensure that only legitimate systems can access the configured CCS server ports. Harden the CCS server accordingly to prevent unauthorized access. Consider applying encryption and authentication on the network (e.g., via TLS on application level or via IPSec on host level).* Harden the CCS server to prevent local access by unauthorized users.* Disable the web interface of CCS if not used. Alternatively, restrict access from localhost only, or only to trusted hosts of CCS administrators. Enable TLS for the web interface of CCS.* Disable the FTP service of the CCS. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices to run the devices in a protected IT environment. For more information see [SSA\\-761844](http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Monitor traffic on Ports 5444/TCP and 5440/TCP.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
