A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2 \u200b\n [MISSING RELEASE OF MEMORY AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE\\-401](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/401.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bA memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the small table perturb size.

A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3 \u200b\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS IN OUTPUT USED BY A DOWNSTREAM COMPONENT ('INJECTION') CWE\\-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bGuests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-3643](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3643) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.4 \u200b\n [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bA timing\\-based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-4304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4304) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.5 \u200b\n [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bThe function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer, then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial\\-of\\-service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-4450](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed, and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_ASN1\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_CMS\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_PKCS7\\_stream, SMIME\\_write\\_ASN1, SMIME\\_write\\_CMS and SMIME\\_write\\_PKCS7\\. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\\_ASN1\\_bio\\_stream, BIO\\_new\\_CMS, BIO\\_new\\_PKCS7, i2d\\_CMS\\_bio\\_stream and i2d\\_PKCS7\\_bio\\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2023\\-0215](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0215) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e., the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which needs to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2023\\-0286](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0286) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
