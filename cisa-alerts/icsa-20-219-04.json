EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: TPEditor\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Write-what-where Condition, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of TPEditor, a programming software for Delta text panels, are affected:\n\nTPEditor Versions 1.97 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nAn out-of-bounds read may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\nCVE-2020-16219 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nA stack-based buffer overflow may be exploited by processing a specially crafted project file. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-16221 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based buffer overflow may be exploited by processing a specially crafted project file. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-16223 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WRITE-WHAT-WHERE CONDITION CWE-123\nA write-what-where condition may be exploited by processing a specially crafted project file. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\nCVE-2020-16225 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn improper input validation may be exploited by processing a specially crafted project file not validated when the data is entered by a user. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\nCVE-2020-16227 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKdot, kimiya of 9SG Security Team, Justin Taft and Chris Anastasio working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends affected users update to the latest version of Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor, Version 1.98\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
