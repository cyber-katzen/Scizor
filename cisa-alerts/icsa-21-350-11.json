EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC eaSie PCS 7 Skill Package\nVulnerability: Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the application server.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SIMATIC eaSie PCS 7 Skill Package, a digital assistant, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC eaSie PCS 7 Skill Package (6DL5424-0BX00-0AV8): All versions prior to 21.00 SP3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY (\u2018PATH TRAVERSAL\u2019) CWE-22\nWhen downloading files, the affected systems do not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname. An attacker could then cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory on the server and read unexpected critical files. The affected file download function is disabled by default.\nCVE-2021-42022 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to v21.00 SP3 or later version.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-199605\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
