This web page release was delayed to provide the vendor time to contact customers concerning this information.Independent researcher Carlos Mario Penagos Hollmann has identified an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability, commonly referred to as a dll hijack, in Invensys\u2019s Wonderware InTouch application. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.ICS-CERT has coordinated the report with Invensys, which has produced an upgrade to address this vulnerability. Mr. Hollmann has validated that the upgrade resolves the reported vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nA vulnerability has been discovered in a common dll component used by InTouch and other Wonderware System Platform products. The following Invensys products contain the vulnerable dll and are affected:\n\nInTouch 2012 and all prior versions,\nWonderware Application Server 2012 and prior versions,\nWonderware Information Server 4.5 and prior versions,\nFoxboro Control Software 4.0 and all prior versions,\nInFusion CE/FE/SCADA 2.5 and all prior versions,\nInBatch 9.5 SP1 and all prior versions, and\nWonderware Historian 10.0 SP1 and all prior versions.\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution.Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nThe Invensys Wonderware InTouch HMI is used in many industries worldwide, including manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemical, and water and wastewater. The Information Server provides industrial information content including process graphics, trends, and reports. The Invensys Wonderware InTouch HMI Web Client provides access to these reports, analyses, and write back capabilities to processes.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nUncontrolled Search Path ElementCWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html, Web site last visited July 23, 2012.\nInTouch uses an open or uncontrolled search path to find resources, which could allow anunauthorized user to easily locate and exploit one or more locations. An unauthorized user could place a malicious dll in a directory where it could be loaded before the valid dll. An attacker must have access to the host file system to exploit this vulnerability. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads a malformed dll file.CVE-2012-3005NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3005, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 Base Score of 6.6 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads a malformed dll file.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a moderate skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\nInvensys has provided instructions and a link to the software download that can be found here: https://wdn.wonderware.com/sites/WDN/Pages/Downloads/Software.aspx.Any machine running one or more of the products listed above is affected and should be patched. No other components of the Wonderware installed products are affected. Install the Security Update using instructions provided in the ReadMe file for the product and component being installed. In general, the user should:\n\nRead the installation instructions provided with the patch,\nShut down any of the affected software products,\nInstall the update, and\nRestart the software.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\n",
