Restrict usage of PowerShell and update Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core to the latest version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Summary\n\n\n\n***Note:** \n This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI and ACSC investigations as of March 2023\\.\n \n\n\n\n BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group that has targeted organizations in multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors since June 2022\\. They have also targeted Australian critical infrastructure sectors in addition to professional services and property development. The group gains access to victim systems through valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, uses open\\-source tools and command\\-line scripting for discovery and credential harvesting, and exfiltrates victim data via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone, or Mega. BianLian group actors then extort money by threatening to release data if payment is not made. BianLian group originally employed a double\\-extortion model in which they encrypted victims\u2019 systems after exfiltrating the data; however, around January 2023, they shifted to primarily exfiltration\\-based extortion.\n \n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small\\- and medium\\-sized organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware incidents.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report (710kb):\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-136A \\#StopRansomware: BianLian Ransomware Group](/sites/default/files/2023-05/aa23-136a_stopransomware_bianlian_ransomware_group_1.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 644\\.23 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs (35kb), see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-136A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2023-05/aa23-136a.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 34\\.72 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs in JSON format, see\n [AA23\\-136A.stix.json](/sites/default/files/STIX/AA23-136A_StopRansomware_BianLian_Ransomware_Group \"JSON file for AA23-136A\") \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae \n for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/) \n framework, version 13\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae Tactics and Techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping) \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group. FBI observed BianLian group targeting organizations in multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors since June 2022\\. In Australia, ACSC has observed BianLian group predominately targeting private enterprises, including one critical infrastructure organization. BianLian group originally employed a double\\-extortion model in which they exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files for leverage and encrypted victims\u2019 systems. In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift to primarily exfiltration\\-based extortion with victims\u2019 systems left intact, and ACSC observed BianLian shift exclusively to exfiltration\\-based extortion. BianLian actors warn of financial, business, and legal ramifications if payment is not made.\n \n\n\n#### Initial Access\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors gain initial access to networks by leveraging compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials likely acquired from initial access brokers \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/) \n ],\\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1133/) \n ] or via phishing \\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1566) \n ].\n \n\n\n#### Command and Control\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors implant a custom backdoor specific to each victim written in Go (see the\n [Indicators of Compromise](#_Indicators_of_Compromise) \n Section for an example) \\[\n [T1587\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1587/001/) \n ] and install remote management and access software\u2014e.g., TeamViewer, Atera Agent, SplashTop, AnyDesk\u2014for persistence and command and control \\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1105/) \n ],\\[\n [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1219/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n FBI also observed BianLian group actors create and/or activate local administrator accounts \\[\n [T1136\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1136/001) \n ] and change those account passwords \\[\n [T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1098/) \n ].\n \n\n\n#### Defense Evasion\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors use PowerShell \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/001/) \n ] and Windows Command Shell \\[\n [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/003/) \n ] to disable antivirus tools \\[\n [T1562\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1562/001/) \n\n ]\n \n , specifically Windows defender and Anti\\-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). BianLian actors modify the Windows Registry \\[\n [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1112) \n ] to disable tamper protection for Sophos SAVEnabled, SEDEenabled, and SAVService services, which enables them to uninstall these services. See\n [Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity](#_APPENDIX_:_) \n for additional information, including specific commands they have used.\n \n\n\n#### Discovery\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors use a combination of compiled tools, which they first download to the victim environment, to learn about the victim\u2019s environment. BianLian group actors have used:\n \n\n\n* Advanced Port Scanner, a network scanner used to find open ports on network computers and retrieve versions of programs running on the detected ports \\[\n [T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1046/) \n ].\n* SoftPerfect Network Scanner (\n netscan.exe\n ), a network scanner that can ping computers, scan ports, and discover shared folders \\[\n [T1135](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1135/) \n\n ]\n \n .\n* SharpShares to enumerate accessible network shares in a domain.\n* PingCastle to enumerate Active Directory (AD) \\[\n [T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1482/) \n ]. PingCastle provides an AD map to visualize the hierarchy of trust relationships.\n\n\n\n BianLian actors also use native Windows tools and Windows Command Shell to:\n \n\n\n* Query currently logged\\-in users \\[\n [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1033/) \n ].\n* Query the domain controller to identify:\n\t+ All groups \\[\n\t [T1069\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1069/002/) \n\t ].\n\t+ Accounts in the\n\t Domain Admins\n\t and\n\t Domain Computers\n\t groups \\[\n\t [1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1087/002/) \n\t ].\n\t+ All users in the domain.\n* Retrieve a list of all domain controllers and domain trusts.\n* Identify accessible devices on the network \\[\n [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1018/) \n ].\n\n\n\n See\n [Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity](#_APPENDIX_:_) \n for additional information, including specific commands they have used.\n \n\n\n#### Credential Access\n\n\n\n BianLian group uses valid accounts for lateral movement through the network and to pursue other follow\\-on activity. To obtain the credentials, BianLian group actors use Windows Command Shell to find unsecured credentials on the local machine \\[\n [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1552/001/) \n ]. FBI also observed BianLian harvest credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory \\[\n [T1003\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1003/001/) \n ], download RDP Recognizer (a tool that could be used to brute force RDP passwords or check for RDP vulnerabilities) to the victim system, and attempt to access an Active Directory domain database (\n NTDS.dit\n ) \\[\n [T1003\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1003/003/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n In one case, FBI observed BianLian actors use a portable executable version of an\n [Impacket](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/software/S0357/) \n tool (\n secretsdump.py\n ) to move laterally to a domain controller and harvest credential hashes from it.\n **Note:** \n Impacket is a Python toolkit for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. Through the Command Shell, an Impacket user with credentials can run commands on a remote device using the Windows management protocols required to support an enterprise network. Threat actors can run portable executable files on victim systems using local user rights, assuming the executable is not blocked by an application allowlist or antivirus solution.\n \n\n\n\n See\n [Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity](#_APPENDIX_:_) \n for additional information.\n \n\n\n#### Persistence and Lateral Movement\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors use PsExec and RDP with valid accounts for lateral movement \\[\n [T1021\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1021/001/) \n ]. Prior to using RDP, BianLian actors used Command Shell and native Windows tools to add user accounts to the local\n Remote Desktop Users\n group, modified the added account\u2019s password, and modified Windows firewall rules to allow incoming RDP traffic \\[\n [T1562\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1562/004/) \n ]. See\n [Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity](#_APPENDIX_:_) \n for additional information.\n \n\n\n\n In one case, FBI found a forensic artifact (\n exp.exe\n ) on a compromised system that likely exploits the Netlogon vulnerability (\n [CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472) \n ) and connects to a domain controller.\n \n\n\n#### Collection\n\n\n\n FBI observed BianLian group actors using malware (\n system.exe\n ) that enumerates registry \\[\n [T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1012/) \n ] and files \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1083/) \n ] and copies clipboard data from users \\[\n [T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1115/) \n ].\n \n\n\n#### Exfiltration and Impact\n\n\n\n BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See\n [Appendix: Windows PowerShell and Command Shell Activity](#_APPENDIX_:_) \n ) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023, BianLian actors encrypted files \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1486/) \n ] after exfiltration for double extortion.\n \n\n\n\n BianLian group uses File Transfer Protocol (FTP) \\[\n [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1048/) \n ] and\n [Rclone](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/software/S1040/) \n , a tool used to sync files to cloud storage, to exfiltrate data \\[\n [T1537](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1537/) \n ]. FBI observed BianLian group actors install Rclone and other files in generic and typically unchecked folders such as\n programdata\\\\vmware\n and music folders. ACSC observed BianLian group actors use Mega file\\-sharing service to exfiltrate victim data \\[\n [T1567\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1567/002/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n BianLian\u2019s encryptor (\n encryptor.exe\n ) modified all encrypted files to have the\n .bianlian\n extension. The encryptor created a ransom note,\n Look at this instruction.txt\n , in each affected directory (see Figure 1 for an example ransom note.) According to the ransom note, BianLian group specifically looked for, encrypted, and exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 1: BianLian Sample Ransom Note (Look at this instruction.txt)* \n\n| Your network systems were attacked and encrypted.

The ransom note provides the Tox ID\n A4B3B0845DA242A64BF17E0DB4278EDF85855739667D3E2AE8B89D5439015F07E81D12D767FC\n , which does not vary across victims. The Tox ID directs the victim organization to a Tox chat via\n https://qtox.github\\[.]io\n and includes an alternative contact email address (\n swikipedia@onionmail\\[.]org\n or\n xxx@mail2tor\\[.]com\n ). The email address is also the same address listed on the group\u2019s Tor site under the contact information section. Each victim company is assigned a unique identifier included in the ransom note. BianLian group receives payments in unique cryptocurrency wallets for each victim company.\n \n\n\n\n BianLian group engages in additional techniques to pressure the victim into paying the ransom; for example, printing the ransom note to printers on the compromised network.

These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"https://www.cisa.gov/cpg\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n* Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Auditing remote access tools** \n\t on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized software.\n\t+ **Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software** \n\t to detect abnormal use of programs running as a portable executable \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.T](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ **Using security software to detect instances of remote access** \n\t software only being loaded in memory.\n\t+ **Requiring authorized remote access solutions only be used from within your network over approved remote access solutions** \n\t , such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs).\n\t+ **Blocking both inbound and outbound connections on common remote access software ports and protocols** \n\t at the network perimeter.\n* **Implement application controls to manage and control execution of software** \n , including allowlisting remote access programs.\n\t+ Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n\n\n\n See NSA Cybersecurity Information sheet\n [Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180334/-1/-1/0/Enforce%20Signed%20Software%20Execution%20Policies%20-%20Copy.pdf) \n for additional guidance.\n \n\n\n* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services** \n . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ]:\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ Apply\n\t [phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf) \n\t .\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n* **Disable command\\-line and scripting activities and permissions** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.N](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ]\n **.**\n* **Restrict the use of PowerShell** \n , using Group Policy, and only grant to specific users on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Typically, only those users or administrators who manage the network or Windows operating systems (OSs) should be permitted to use PowerShell \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Update Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core** \n to the latest version and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions. Logs from Windows PowerShell prior to version 5\\.0 are either non\\-existent or do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E, 2\\.S, 2\\.T](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Enable enhanced PowerShell logging** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.T, 2\\.U](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n\t+ PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and possible TTPs of a threat actor\u2019s PowerShell use.\n\t+ Ensure PowerShell instances, using the latest version, have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).\n\t+ The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the\n\t PowerShell\n\t Windows Event Log and the\n\t PowerShell Operational\n\t Log. FBI and CISA recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.\n* **Configure the Windows Registry to require User Account Control (UAC) approval for any PsExec operations** \n requiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.\n* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories** \n for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[\n [CPG 4\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Audit user accounts** \n with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following\n **:** \n\t+ **Place domain admin accounts in the protected users\u2019 group** \n\t to prevent caching of password hashes locally.\n\t+ **Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016** \n\t (Refer to\n\t [Microsoft: Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage \"Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard\") \n\t for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\n\t+ **Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts** \n\t .\n* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.A, 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ]\n **.** \n For example, the Just\\-in\\-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory (AD) level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.\n\n\n\n In addition, FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data,** \n and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization minimizes the impact of disruption to business practices as they will not be as severe and/or only have irretrievable data \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ]. ACSC recommends organizations follow the 3\\-2\\-1 backup strategy in which organizations have three copies of data (one copy of production data and two backup copies) on two different media such as disk and tape, with one copy kept off\\-site for disaster recovery.\n* **Require all accounts** \n with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\n **to comply** \n with\n [National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.B](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\n\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\n\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.G](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Disable password \u201chints\u201d.\n\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\t   \n\t\n\t**Note:** \n\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication** \n for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Organizations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to 48 hours from vulnerability disclosure. Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n in internet\\-facing systems \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Segment networks** \n to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections, as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software** \n on all hosts.\n* **Disable unused** \n**ports** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.V](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ]\n **.**\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n\n\n#### Validate Security Controls\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 2\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### RESOURCES\n\n\n* [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.stopransomware.gov/) \n , a whole\\-of\\-government approach with one central location for U.S. ransomware resources and alerts.\n* [cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/) \n for the Australian Government\u2019s central location to report cyber incidents, including ransomware, and to see advice and alerts.

The FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a\n [local FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) \n or CISA at\n [cisa.gov/report](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report) \n .
