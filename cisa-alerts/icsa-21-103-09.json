EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.4\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: LOGO! Soft Comfort\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a local attacker to take over the system where the software is installed.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following LOGO! engineering software products:\n\nLOGO! Soft Comfort: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nA vulnerability could be triggered while importing a compromised project file to the affected software, which may allow the execution of commands on the system.\nCVE-2020-25243 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nThe software insecurely loads libraries that may allow an attacker to use DLL hijacking and takeover the system where the software is installed.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-25244 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMashav Sapir from Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nIf possible do not execute the LOGO! Soft Comfort software with administrative privileges\nRestrict access to project files on the engineering station to trusted users\nImport only project files from trusted sources\n\nPlease see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-983300 for more information.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
