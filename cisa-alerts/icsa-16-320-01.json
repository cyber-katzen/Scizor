Lynxspring has discontinued the BAS Bridge application and recommends that users upgrade to the Onyxx Bridge product.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following BAS Bridge versions are affected:\n\n\u00a0BAS Bridge versions 1.1.8 and older.\n\nIMPACT\nAttackers are able to change permissions and access controls and also gain access to the system. They are also able to retrieve credentials. The application transmits or stores authentication credentials and uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval. The application also does not properly verify requests allowing attackers to use a cross\u2011site request forgery.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nLynxspring is a US-based company that maintains offices in Lee\u2019s Summit, Missouri.\nThe affected product, BAS Bridge, is a web-based SCADA system. According to Lynxspring, BAS Server is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Lynxspring estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html, web site last accessed November 15, 2016.\n\nA user with read-only access can send commands to the software and the application will accept those commands. This would allow an attacker with read-only access to make changes within the application.\nCVE-2016-8357NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8357, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has \u00a0been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 15, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nLynxspring recommends replacing existing BAS Bridge installations with the Onyxx Bridge product. The Onyxx Bridge product has been tested by Lynxspring to be free of the existing vulnerabilities in the old product. BAS Bridge has been end of life since 2014 and no further updates will be issued.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
