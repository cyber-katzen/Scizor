For more details refer to Modicon Controllers Platform \\- Cyber Security, Reference Manual chapter \u201c\n [How to protect M580 and M340 architectures with EAGLE40 using VPN](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001999/) \n \u201d.\n* Modicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP\\* and BMEH\\*): Set up an application password in the project properties.\n* Modicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP\\* and BMEH\\*): Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to port 502/TCP.\n* Modicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP\\* and BMEH\\*): Configure the access control list following the recommendations of the user manuals:\n [Modicon M580, Hardware, Reference Manual](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001578/) \n .\n* Modicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP\\* and BMEH\\*): Setup a secure communication following recommended guidelines in Modicon Controllers Platform \\- Cyber Security Reference Manual chapter \u201c\n [Setup secured communications](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001999/) \n \u201d.\n* Modicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP\\* and BMEH\\*): Use a BMENUA0100 module and follow the instructions to configure IPSEC feature as described in M580 \\- BMENUA0100 OPC UA Embedded Module, Installation and Configuration Guide chapter \u201c\n [Configuring the BMENUA0100 Cybersecurity Settings](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/PHA83350) \n \u201d.\n\n\n\n For more information, see Schneider Electric\u2019s security advisory\n [SEVD\\-2023\\-010\\-06](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2023-010-06/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:\n \n\n\n* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\n* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\n* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\n* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the internet.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n* For more information refer to the\n [Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/) \n .\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities have been reported to CISA at this time.
