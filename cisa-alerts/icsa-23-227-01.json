For more details refer to Modicon Controllers Platform - Cyber Security, Reference Manual chapter \u201cHow to protect M580 and M340 architectures with EAGLE40 using VPN\u201d.\nModicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*): Set up an application password in the project properties.\nModicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*): Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to port 502/TCP.\nModicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*): Configure the access control list following the recommendations of the user manuals: Modicon M580, Hardware, Reference Manual.\nModicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*): Setup a secure communication following recommended guidelines in Modicon Controllers Platform - Cyber Security Reference Manual chapter \u201cSetup secured communications\u201d.\nModicon M580 CPU (part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*): Use a BMENUA0100 module and follow the instructions to configure IPSEC feature as described in M580 - BMENUA0100 OPC UA Embedded Module, Installation and Configuration Guide chapter \u201cConfiguring the BMENUA0100 Cybersecurity Settings\u201d.\n\nFor more information, see Schneider Electric\u2019s security advisory SEVD-2023-010-06.\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\nPlace all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\nNever connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\nScan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nNever allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nFor more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities have been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
