Sauter has not produced a mitigation for this vulnerability. This product was discontinued in 2013 and is no longer supported.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following NovaWeb versions are affected:\n\nNovaWeb web HMI, all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker can bypass authentication by modifying values in a cookie.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSauter is a Germany-based company that also maintains an office in Switzerland.\nThe affected product, novaWeb web HMI, is a web-based HMI system. According to Sauter, novaWeb was deployed in the Commercial Facilities and Critical Manufacturing sectors. Sauter estimates that this product is used primarily in Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nRELIANCE ON COOKIES WITHOUT VALIDATION AND INTEGRITY CHECKING IN A SECURITY DECISIONCWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/784.html, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\n\nThe application uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\nCVE-2016-5782NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5782, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of \u00a07.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSauter has not produced a mitigation for this vulnerability. This product was discontinued in 2013 and is no longer supported.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
