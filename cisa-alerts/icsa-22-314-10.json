TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following versions of SCALANCE W1750D, which is a brand-labeled access point device from Aruba:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE W1750D (JP) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AD0): All versions\u00a0\nSCALANCE W1750D (ROW) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AA0): All versions\u00a0\nSCALANCE W1750D (USA) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AB0): All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\u00a0\nThe Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers (not actual public keys) and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a D(HE)ater attack. The client requires few CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE. \u00a0\nCVE-2002-20001 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

For more information regarding these vulnerabilities, see the Aruba security advisory ARUBA-PSA-2022-014.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
