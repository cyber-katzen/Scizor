TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following versions of SCALANCE W1750D, which is a brand\\-labeled access point device from Aruba:* SCALANCE W1750D (JP) (6GK5750\\-2HX01\\-1AD0\\): All versions* SCALANCE W1750D (ROW) (6GK5750\\-2HX01\\-1AA0\\): All versions* SCALANCE W1750D (USA) (6GK5750\\-2HX01\\-1AB0\\): All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### **3\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)** The Diffie\\-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers (not actual public keys) and trigger expensive server\\-side DHE modular\\-exponentiation calculations, aka a D(HE)ater attack. The client requires few CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.[CVE\\-2002\\-20001](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2002-20001)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Siemens SCALANCE W1750D is a brand\\-labeled device from Aruba. For more information regarding these vulnerabilities, see the Aruba security advisory [ARUBA\\-PSA\\-2022\\-014](https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2022-014.txt)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
