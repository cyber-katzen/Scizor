MITIGATIONS--------------- Equinox has not responded to requests to provide mitigating details regarding this vulnerability. CISA will update this vulnerability with any information provided by the vendor. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Where possible, obtain security updates from vendor and apply available patches.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Implement firewall rules to block or restrict Internet and intranet access for database systems.* Harden internal systems against the potential threat posed by a compromised system on the local network. (Do not rely on firewalls to prevent access to insecure systems; secure them).* Implement firewall rules to block known malicious IP addresses.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* Run only the minimum required applications and services necessary to perform their intended function. Where possible, disable all unnecessary applications and services.* Disable potentially harmful SQL stored procedure calls.* Do not disclose internal database structure, table names, or account names.* Sanitize or validate input by ensuring data is properly typed and does not contain escaped code. Consider using type\\-safe stored procedures/prepared statements.* Delete/disable unnecessary accounts (including default accounts).* Delete/disable unnecessary stored procedures/prepared statements. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
