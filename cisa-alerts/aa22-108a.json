This group is commonly tracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus Group, APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima. For more information on North Korean state\\-sponsored malicious cyber activity, visit\n [https://www.us\\-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea) \n .\n \n\n\n\n The U.S. government has observed North Korean cyber actors targeting a variety of organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry, including cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play\\-to\\-earn cryptocurrency video games, cryptocurrency trading companies, venture capital funds investing in cryptocurrency, and individual holders of large amounts of cryptocurrency or valuable non\\-fungible tokens (NFTs). The activity described in this advisory involves social engineering of victims using a variety of communication platforms to encourage individuals to download trojanized cryptocurrency applications on Windows or macOS operating systems. The cyber actors then use the applications to gain access to the victim\u2019s computer, propagate malware across the victim\u2019s network environment, and steal private keys or exploit other security gaps. These activities enable additional follow\\-on activities that initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions.\n \n\n\n\n The U.S. government previously published an advisory about North Korean state\\-sponsored cyber actors using AppleJeus malware to steal cryptocurrency:\n [AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea\u2019s Cryptocurrency Malware](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a) \n . The U.S. government has also previously published advisories about North Korean state\\-sponsored cyber actors stealing money from banks using custom malware:\n \n\n\n* [HIDDEN COBRA \u2013 FASTCash Campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A)\n* [FASTCash 2\\.0: North Korea\u2019s BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a)\n\n\n\n This advisory provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to stakeholders in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry to help them identify and mitigate cyber threats against cryptocurrency.\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-108A-TraderTraitor-North_Korea_APT_Targets_Blockchain_Companies.pdf) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/A22-108A.stix.xml) \n for STIX.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n#### **Threat Update**\n\n\n\n The U.S. government has identified a group of North Korean state\\-sponsored malicious cyber actors using tactics similar to the previously identified Lazarus Group (see\n [AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea\u2019s Cryptocurrency Malware](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a) \n ). The Lazarus Group used AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency applications targeting individuals and companies\u2014including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services companies\u2014through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. As of April 2022, North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group actors have targeted various firms, entities, and exchanges in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry using spearphishing campaigns and malware to steal cryptocurrency. These actors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming companies, and exchanges to generate and launder funds to support the North Korean regime.\n \n\n\n#### **Tactics, Techniques and Procedures**\n\n\n\n Intrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency companies\u2014often working in system administration or software development/IT operations (DevOps)\u2014on a variety of communication platforms. The messages often mimic a recruitment effort and offer high\\-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware\\-laced cryptocurrency applications, which the U.S. government refers to as \"TraderTraitor.\"\n \n\n\n\n The term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross\\-platform JavaScript code with the Node.js runtime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious applications are derived from a variety of open\\-source projects and purport to be cryptocurrency trading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design advertising the alleged features of the applications (see figure 1\\).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n***Figure 1: Screenshot of CryptAIS website***\n\n\n\n\n The JavaScript code providing the core functions of the software is bundled with Webpack. Within the code is a function that purports to be an \u201cupdate,\u201d with a name such as\n `UpdateCheckSync()` \n , that downloads and executes a malicious payload (see figure 2\\).\n \n\n\n\n The update function makes an HTTP POST request to a PHP script hosted on the TraderTraitor project\u2019s domain at either the endpoint\n `/update/` \n or\n `/oath/checkupdate.php` \n . In recent variants, the server\u2019s response is parsed as a JSON document with a key\\-value pair, where the key is used as an AES 256 encryption key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Counter (CTR) mode to decrypt the value. The decrypted data is written as a file to the system\u2019s temporary directory, as provided by the\n `os.tmpdir()` \n method of Node.js, and executed using the\n `child_process.exec()` \n method of Node.js, which spawns a shell as a child process of the current Electron application. The text \u201cUpdate Finished\u201d is then logged to the shell for the user to see.\n \n\n\n\n Observed payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote access trojan (RAT), that collects system information and has the ability to execute arbitrary commands and download additional payloads (see\n [North Korean Remote Access Tool: COPPERHEDGE](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133a) \n ). Post\\-compromise activity is tailored specifically to the victim\u2019s environment and at times has been completed within a week of the initial intrusion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n***Figure 2:\u00a0Screenshot depicting the UpdateCheckSync() and supporting functions bundled within 60b3cfe2ec3100caf4afde734cfd5147f78acf58ab17d4480196831db4aa5f18 associated with DAFOM***\n\n\n\n#### **Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\n\n***DAFOM***\n  \n\n DAFOM purports to be a \u201ccryptocurrency portfolio application.\u201d A Mach\\-O binary packaged within the Electron application was signed by an Apple digital signature issued for the Apple Developer Team W58CYKFH67\\.

The U.S. government recommends implementing mitigations to protect critical infrastructure organizations as well as financial sector organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry.\n \n\n\n* Apply defense\\-in\\-depth security strategy. Apply security principles\u2014such as least access models and defense\\-in\\-depth\u2014to user and application privileges to help prevent exploitation attempts from being successful. Use network segmentation to separate networks into zones based on roles and requirements. Separate network zones can help prevent lateral movement throughout the organization and limit the attack surface. See NSA\u2019s\n [Top Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategies](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jul/16/2002158046/-1/-1/0/CSI-NSAS-TOP10-CYBERSECURITY-MITIGATION-STRATEGIES.PDF) \n for strategies enterprise organizations should use to build a defense\\-in\\-depth security posture.\n* Implement patch management. Initial and follow\\-on exploitation involves leveraging common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) to gain access to a networked environment. Organizations should have a timely vulnerability and patch management program in place to mitigate exposure to critical CVEs. Prioritize patching of internet\\-facing devices and monitored accordingly for any malicious logic attacks.\n* Enforce credential requirements and multifactor authentication. North Korean malicious cyber actors continuously target user credentials, email, social media, and private business accounts. Organizations should ensure users change passwords regularly to reduce the impact of password spraying and other brute force techniques. The U.S. government recommends organizations implement and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of credential theft. Be aware of\n [MFA interception techniques for some MFA implementations](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a) \n and monitor for anomalous logins.\n* Educate users on social engineering on social media and spearphishing. North Korean actors rely heavily on social engineering, leveraging email and social media platforms to build trust and send malicious documents to unsuspecting users. A cybersecurity aware workforce is one of the best defenses against social engineering techniques like phishing. User training should include how to identify social engineering techniques and awareness to only open links and attachments from trusted senders.\n* Implement email and domain mitigations. Maintain awareness of themed emails surrounding current events. Malicious cyber actors use current events as lure for potential victims as observed during the COVID\\-19 pandemic. Organizations should have a robust domain security solution that includes leveraging reputation checks and closely monitoring or blocking newly registered domains (NRDs) in enterprise traffic. NRDs are commonly established by threat actors prior to malicious engagement.\n\t+ HTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in emails and scan email attachments. Embedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus product to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning interface product can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the payload to the primary antivirus product. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned and opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a user clicking on a malicious link.\n* Endpoint protection. Although network security is critical, devices mobility often means traveling and connecting to multiple different networks that offer varying levels of security. To reduce the risk of introducing exposed hosts to critical networks, organizations should ensure mobile devices have installed security suites to detect and mitigate malware.\n* Enforce application security. Application allowlisting enables the organization to monitor programs and only allow those on the approved allowlist to execute. Allowlisting helps to stop the initial attack, even if the user clicks a malicious link or opens a malicious attachment. Implement baseline rule sets, such as NSA\u2019s\n [Limiting Location Data Exposure](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/04/2002469874/-1/-/0/CSI_LIMITING_LOCATION_DATA_EXPOSURE_FINAL.PDF) \n guidance, to block execution of unauthorized or malicious programs.\n\t+ Disable macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through an attached office document. Some office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization, providing a hybrid approach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros.\n\t\t- Windows specific settings can be configured to block internet\\-originated macros from running. This can be done in the Group Policy Administrative Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel and PowerPoint). Other productivity software, such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice, can be configured to set the Macro Security Level.\n* Be aware of third\\-party downloads\u2014especially cryptocurrency applications. North Korean actors have been increasingly active with currency generation operations. Users should always verify file downloads and ensure the source is from a reputable or primary (preferred) source and not from a third\\-party vendor. Malicious cyber actors have continuously demonstrated the ability to trojanize applications and gain a foothold on host devices.\n* Create an incident response plan to respond to possible cyber intrusions.
