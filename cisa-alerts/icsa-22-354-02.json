EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\u00a0\nEquipment: GuardLogix, ControlLogix, Compact Logix, and Compact GaurdLogix controllers\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially lead to degradation in availability of the controller and/or a possible major nonrecoverable fault.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following controllers:\u00a0\n\nCompactLogix 5370 Versions 20\u201333\nCompact GuardLogix 5370 Versions 28\u201333\nControlLogix 5570 Versions 20\u201333\nControlLogix5570 redundancy Versions 20\u201333\nGuardLogix 5570 Versions 20\u201333\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn improper input validation vulnerability exists in affected versions of Rockwell Automation controllers that could allow a malformed CIP request to cause a major nonrecoverable fault and a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2022-3157 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released product updates addressing this vulnerability:\n\nFor CompactLogix 5370, Compact GuardLogix 5370, ControlLogix 5570, GuardLogix 5570: Users should upgrade to versions 33.013, 34.011, or later.\nFor ControlLogix 5570 redundancy: Users should upgrade to versions 33.052, 34.051, or later.\n\nRockwell Automation encourages users to apply mitigations on their security best practices web page to reduce risk.\nUsers should see the Rockwell Automation security advisory for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
