MITIGATIONS--------------- Emerson recommends users patch the affected products listed below:* DeltaV DCS Versions 11\\.3\\.1, 12\\.3\\.1, 13\\.3\\.0, 13\\.3\\.1, and R5: Apply patch from vendor. Software patches are available to users with access to the Guardian Support Portal at <https://guardian.emersonprocess.com/> . Please refer to the Knowledge Base Article AK\\-1800\\- 0042 (DSN18003\\) for more information. Vulnerabilities CVE\\-2018\\-14797, CVE\\-2018\\-14795, and CVE\\-2018\\-14791 cannot be exploited if application whitelisting is implemented since it would prevent files from being overwritten. To limit exposure to these and other vulnerabilities, Emerson recommends deploying and configuring DeltaV systems and related components as described in the DeltaV Security Manual, which is available in Emerson\u2019s Guardian Support Portal. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
