EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: RWG Universal Controllers\nVulnerability: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports this vulnerability affects the following RWG controllers:\n\nRWG1.M8: All versions prior to v1.16.16\nRWG1.M12: All versions prior to v1.16.16\nRWG1.M12D: All versions prior to v1.16.16\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE-770\nSending specially crafted ARP packets to an affected device could cause a partial denial-of-service, which may prevent the device from operating normally. A restart is needed to restore normal operations.\nCVE-2021-25671 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users login to the RWG Controller Graphical programming platform, generate a new project file, and download the new project file to the device.\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nEnsure only trusted systems are connected to the same Layer 2 domain as the affected devices;\nRestrict access to systems in the same Layer 2 domain as the affected devices to trusted persons only.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.\nPlease see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-448291 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
