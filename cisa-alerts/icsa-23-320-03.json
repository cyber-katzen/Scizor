EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Desigo CC product family\nVulnerabilities: Buffer Over-Read, Heap-Based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Desigo CC server or create a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the following products are affected by vulnerabilities in the underlying third-party component WIBU Systems CodeMeter Runtime:\n\nDesigo CC product family V5.0: All versions\nDesigo CC product family V5.1: All versions\nDesigo CC product family V6: All versions\nDesigo CC product family V7: All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0BUFFER OVER-READ CWE-126\nA buffer over-read vulnerability in the CodeMeter Runtime network server could cause the server to return packets containing data from the heap. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this issue to disclose heap memory contents or crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).\nCVE-2021-20093\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0BUFFER OVER-READ CWE-126\nA buffer over-read vulnerability in the HTTP(S) service of the CodeMeter Runtime CmWAN server could cause the server to crash. An unauthenticated remote attacker with access to the CmWAN port could exploit this issue to crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).\nCVE-2021-20094\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nIn CodeMeter Runtime versions up to 7.60b, there is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability which can potentially lead to a remote code execution. Currently, no PoC is known to us. To exploit the heap overflow, additional protection mechanisms need to be broken. Remote access is only possible if CodeMeter is configured as a server. If CodeMeter is not configured as a server, the adversary would need to log in to the machine where the CodeMeter Runtime is running or trick the user into sending a malicious request to CodeMeter. This might result in an escalation of privilege. (WIBU-230704-01)\nCVE-2023-3935\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens ProductCERT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released\u00a0a patch, to update the CodeMeter Runtime component and recommends to apply the patch on affected systems.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-625850 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nFor more details regarding the vulnerabilities in CodeMeter Runtime refer to:\n\nWIBU Systems Security Advisory WIBU-210423-01\nWIBU Systems Security Advisory WIBU-210423-02\nWIBU Systems Security Advisory WIBU-230704-01\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
