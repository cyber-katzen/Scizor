EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: CISA\nEquipment: Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Plugin for Zeek\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write, Out-of-bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GitHub commits (versions) of ICSNPP - Ethercat Plugin, a plugin for Zeek, are affected:\n\nIndustrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin: versions d78dda6 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nIndustrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin versions d78dda6 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds write in their primary analyses function for Ethercat communication packets. This could allow an attacker to cause arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2023-7244\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nIndustrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin versions d78dda6 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds write while analyzing specific Ethercat datagrams. This could allow an attacker to cause arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2023-7243\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nIndustrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin versions d78dda6 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read during the process of analyzing a specific Ethercat packet. This could allow an attacker to crash the Zeek process and leak some information in memory.\nCVE-2023-7242\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCameron Whitehead of HACK@UCF reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCISA recommends that users update Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin to\u00a0commit 3bca34c or later.\nTo help reduce successful exploitation, users are encouraged to keep critical software updates and patches up to date in their system networks.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
