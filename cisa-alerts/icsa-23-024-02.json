EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: SOCOMEC\nEquipment: MODULYS GP\nVulnerability: Weak Encoding for Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information on the target system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SOCOMEC MODULYS GP, a modular UPS, are affected:\n\nMODULYS GP Net Vision: versions 7.20 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0WEAK ENCODING FOR PASSWORD CWE-261\nSOCOMEC MODULYS GP Netvision versions 7.20 and prior lack strong encryption for credentials on HTTP connections, which could result in threat actors obtaining sensitive information.\nCVE-2023-0356\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJavier Fernandez Ber\u00e9 and Aar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez of S21sec reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSOCOMEC has released\u00a0Net Vision FW v7.42\nFor more information contact\u00a0SOCOMEC\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
