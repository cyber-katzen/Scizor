EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 9\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n SCALANCE XCM332\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, Use After Free, Concurrent Execution Using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), Incorrect Default Permissions, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, and Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, code execution, data injection, and allow unauthorized access.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following software from Siemens is affected:\n \n\n\n* SCALANCE XCM332 (6GK5332\\-0GA01\\-2AC2\\): Versions prior to 2\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In versions of libtirpc prior to 1\\.3\\.3rc1, remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process using libtirpc due to mishandling of idle TCP connections. This could lead to an svc\\_run infinite loop without accepting new connections.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-46828](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-46828) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to leverage a concurrency use\\-after\\-free flaw in the bad\\_flp\\_intr function to execute arbitrary code. By executing a specially\\-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition on the system.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1652) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE\\-362](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf\\_event\\_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives, such as kernel address information leak and arbitrary execution.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1729](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1729) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.4\n [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A use\\-after\\-free in Busybox 1\\.35\\-x's awk applet leads to a denial\\-of\\-service condition and possible code execution when processing a crafted awk pattern in the copyvar function.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-30065](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30065) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.5\n [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of \"Set\\-Cookie:\" headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0, which stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of cookies could make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests larger than the threshold curl uses internally to avoid sending excessively large requests (1048576 bytes), and instead returns an error. This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match, and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on \"foo.example.com\" can set cookies that also would match for \"bar.example.com\", making it possible for a \"sister server\" to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition for a sibling site on the same second level domain using this method.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-32205](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32205) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.6\n [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Versions of curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0 support \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, where a server response can be compressed multiple times with potentially different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps; this could result in a \"malloc bomb,\" making curl spend enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to, and returning out of memory errors.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-32206](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32206) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In this rename operation, these versions of curl \u00a0might accidentally widen the permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than intended.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-32207](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32207) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.8\n [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**\n\n\n\n\n When curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0 performs file transfer protocol (FTP) transfers secured by krb5, it does not handle message verification failures correctly; \u00a0it is possible for a machine\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows injection of data into the client.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-32208](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32208) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This could allow a \"sister site\" to deny service to all sibling sites.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-35252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35252) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens has released an update for the SCALANCE XCM332 and recommends updating to the latest version:\n \n\n\n* SCALANCE XCM332 (6GK5332\\-0GA01\\-2AC2\\): Update to\n [V2\\.2 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109817513/)\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019\n [operational guidelines](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at the\n [Siemens Industrial Security web page](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\n [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-558014 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-558014.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-558014.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\n [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\n* Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-103-09) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2022-32206", "CVE-2022-35252", "CVE-2022-40674", "CVE-2022-30065", "CVE-2022-32205", "CVE-2022-1729", "CVE-2022-32208", "CVE-2022-1652", "CVE-2021-46828", "CVE-2022-32207"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-23-103-09", "title": "Siemens SCALANCE XCM332 | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "43ffb6666fd24297dbf9273dcbc12eb9cf756ce8f38eff20db4369b208035924"}
