TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following software from Siemens is affected:* SCALANCE XCM332 (6GK5332\\-0GA01\\-2AC2\\): Versions prior to 2\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)** In versions of libtirpc prior to 1\\.3\\.3rc1, remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process using libtirpc due to mishandling of idle TCP connections. This could lead to an svc\\_run infinite loop without accepting new connections.[CVE\\-2021\\-46828](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-46828)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to leverage a concurrency use\\-after\\-free flaw in the bad\\_flp\\_intr function to execute arbitrary code. By executing a specially\\-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition on the system.[CVE\\-2022\\-1652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1652)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE\\-362](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)** A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf\\_event\\_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives, such as kernel address information leak and arbitrary execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-1729](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1729)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** A use\\-after\\-free in Busybox 1\\.35\\-x's awk applet leads to a denial\\-of\\-service condition and possible code execution when processing a crafted awk pattern in the copyvar function.[CVE\\-2022\\-30065](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30065)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)** A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of \"Set\\-Cookie:\" headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0, which stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of cookies could make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests larger than the threshold curl uses internally to avoid sending excessively large requests (1048576 bytes), and instead returns an error. This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match, and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on \"foo.example.com\" can set cookies that also would match for \"bar.example.com\", making it possible for a \"sister server\" to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition for a sibling site on the same second level domain using this method.[CVE\\-2022\\-32205](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32205)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)** Versions of curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0 support \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, where a server response can be compressed multiple times with potentially different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps; this could result in a \"malloc bomb,\" making curl spend enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to, and returning out of memory errors.[CVE\\-2022\\-32206](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32206)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.7 [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)** When curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0 saves cookies, alt\\-svc, and hsts data to local files, it finalizes the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name, making the operation atomic. In this rename operation, these versions of curl \u00a0might accidentally widen the permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than intended.[CVE\\-2022\\-32207](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32207)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.8 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** When curl \\< 7\\.84\\.0 performs file transfer protocol (FTP) transfers secured by krb5, it does not handle message verification failures correctly; \u00a0it is possible for a machine\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows injection of data into the client.[CVE\\-2022\\-32208](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32208)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.9 [IMPROPER VALIDATION OF SYNTACTIC CORRECTNESS OF INPUT CWE\\-1286](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1286.html)** When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, it accepts cookies using control codes that, when are later sent back to a HTTP server, might make the server return 400 responses. This could allow a \"sister site\" to deny service to all sibling sites.[CVE\\-2022\\-35252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35252)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.10 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Versions of libexpat before 2\\.4\\.9 have a use\\-after\\-free vulnerability in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.[CVE\\-2022\\-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\.
