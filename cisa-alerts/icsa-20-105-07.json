(\u2018RESOURCE EXHAUSTION\u2019) CWE-400\nThe VxWorks-based PROFINET TCP stack can be forced to make resource-intense calls for every incoming packet, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2019-19301 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n5. MITIGATIONS\n-------- Begin Update H Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE X-200IRT and XF200 switch families: Update to v5.5.0 or later version\nSCALANCE X-200 and XF200 switch families: Update to v5.2.5 or later version\nSCALANCE X300 and XR300 switch families: Update to v4.1.4 or later version\nFor SIMATIC RF180C and RF182C: migrate to a successor product within the SIMATIC RF18xC/CI family v1.3 or later version. For details refer to the phase-out announcement.\u00a0\nFor SIMATIC CP 443-1 RNA: Update to v1.5.18 or later version\nFor SIMATIC CP 442-1 RNA: Update to v1.5.18 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact Siemens.\nFor more information on this vulnerability and the available mitigations, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-102233\n-------- End Update H Part 2 of 2 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
