This information is meant to give the reader a closer look into what analysts are seeing at the national level and provide technical details on some of the most active threats. IDS is a network tool that uses sensors to monitor inbound and outbound traffic to search for any type of suspicious activity or known threats, alerting analysts when a specific traffic pattern matches with an associated threat. IDS allows users to deploy signatures on these boundary sensors to look for the specific pattern, or network indicator, associated with a known threat. The EINSTEIN Program is an automated process for collecting, correlating, analyzing, and sharing computer security information across the federal civilian departments and agencies. By collecting information from participating federal departments and agencies, CISA builds and enhances our Nation\u2019s cyber\\-related situational awareness. The signatures CISA created have been included below for analysts across various organizations to use in enhancing their own network defenses. **Note:**  CISA has created and tested these signatures in an environment that might not be the same for all organizations, so administrators may need to make changes or updates before using in the following signatures in their local environments.### Technical Details***Note:**  the below Snort signatures accounted for over 90 percent of what CISA analysts identified as potential threats using the IDS system for detection.* 1\\. NetSupport Manager RAT--------------------------### Description The NetSupport Manager Remote Access Tool (RAT) is a legitimate program that, once installed on a victim\u2019s machine, allows remote administrative control. In a malicious context, it can\u2014among many other functions\u2014be used to steal information. Malicious RATs can be difficult to detect because they do not normally appear in lists of running programs, and they can mimic the behavior of legitimate applications.### Examples In January 2020, Palo Alto researchers observed the abuse of NetSupport in targeted phishing email campaigns. [\\[1]](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex-xdr-detects-netsupport-manager-rat-campaign/)  In November 2019, Zscaler researchers observed \u201csoftware update\\-themed\u201d campaigns tricking users into installing a malicious NetSupport Manager RAT. [\\[2]](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/netsupport-rat-installed-fake-update-notices)  The earliest malicious use of NetSupport was seen in a phishing email campaign\u2014reported by FireEye researchers in April 2018\\.

Kovter----------### Description Kovter is a fileless Trojan with several variants. This malware started as ransomware that malicious actors used to trick victims into thinking that they need to pay their local police a fine. Cyber actors have also used Kovter to perform click\\-fraud operations to infect targets and send stolen information from the target machines to command and control servers. Kovter\u2019s evolving features have allowed this malware to rank among the Center for Internet Security\u2019s most prolific malware year after year.

XMRig---------### Description XMRig is a type of cryptocurrency miner that uses the resources of an unsuspecting infected machine to mine Monero\u2014a type of cryptocurrency. XMRig can cause a victim computer to overheat and perform poorly by using additional system resources that would otherwise not be active.### Snort Signature`alert tcp any any -> any !25 (msg:\"XMRIG:Non-Std TCP Client Traffic contains JSONRPC 2.0 Config Data\";; flow:established,to_server; flowbits:isnotset; content:\"|22|jsonrpc|22 3a 22|2.0|22|\"; distance:0; content:\"|22|method|22 3a 22|login|22|\"; distance:0; content:\"|22|agent|22 3a 22|XMRig\"; nocase; distance:0; fast_pattern; content:\"libuv/\"; nocase; distance:0; content:!\"|22|login|22 3a 22|x|22|\"; flowbits:set,; classtype:nonstd-tcp;; reference:url,malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/11/12/index.html; reference:url,www.mysonicwall.com/sonicalert/searchresults.aspx?ev=article&id=1101;` ### Mitigations CISA recommends using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of an organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.* Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. See [Protecting Against Malicious Code](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST18-271)  .* Ensure systems have the latest security updates. See [Understanding Patches and Software Updates](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006)  .* Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.* Restrict users' permissions to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators\u2019 group unless required.* Enforce a strong password policy. See [Choosing and Protecting Passwords](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002)  .* Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. See [Using Caution with Email Attachments](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-010)  .* Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations that is configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.* Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.* Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).* Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.* Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).* Scan all software downloaded from the internet prior to executing.* Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
