Users of affected versions of the products should apply the corresponding security update as soon as possible. Security update PCS 4\\.5\\.3 is available for the following versions:* AVEVA Mobile Operator 2020* AVEVA Enterprise Data Management 2021* AVEVA System Platform 2020 R2 P01* AVEVA System Platform 2020 R2* AVEVA Work Tasks 2020 Update 1 Security update PCS 4\\.4\\.7 is available for the following versions:* AVEVA System Platform 2020* AVEVA Work Tasks 2020* AVEVA Manufacturing Execution System 2020* AVEVA Batch Management 2020 For more information on this issue, including security updates, please see Security Bulletin [AVEVA\\-2021\\-008](https://www.aveva.com/en/support-and-success/cyber-security-updates/)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Reduce the attack surface by hard\\-coding the search path to a set of known\\-safe values (such as system directories), or only allow them to be specified by the administrator in a configuration file.* Reduce the attack surface by invoking other programs using fully qualified pathnames.* Reduce the attack surface by removing or restricting all environment settings before invoking other programs.* Check the search path before use and removing any elements that are likely to be unsafe, such as the current working directory or a temporary files directory. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  .
