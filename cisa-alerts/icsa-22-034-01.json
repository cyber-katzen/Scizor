UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis update advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-034-01 Sensormatic PowerManage that was published February 3, 2022, on the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain remote code execution.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Sensormatic Electronics, LLC PowerManage, an operating platform, are affected:\n\nPowerManage Versions 4.0 to 4.8\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected product does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to enter malicious input and potentially gain remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-44228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc., reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls, Inc. has provided the following mitigation steps:\n------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 -------\n\nUpgrade PowerManage to Version 4.10\n\n------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 -------\n\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2022-01 v1\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
