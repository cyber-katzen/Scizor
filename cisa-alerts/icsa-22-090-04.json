A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-312\nThis vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to disclose a file in a legitimate user's product by using previously eavesdropped cleartext information and to counterfeit a legitimate user\u2019s system.\nCVE-2022-25160 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nAnton Dorfman, Dmitry Sklyarov, Iliya Rogachev and Artur Akhatov of Positive Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Mitsubishi Electric.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities:\n\nWhen communicating via untrusted networks or hosts, encrypt the communication path by setting up a VPN.\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nUse firewalls or IP filter function to restrict connections to the products and prevent access from untrusted networks or hosts. For details on IP filter function, refer to the following product manual:\u00a0\n\n\u201c12.1 IP Filter Function\u201d in the MELSEC iQ-F FX 5 User\u2019s Manual (Ethernet Communication)\n\"IP filter\" of \"1.13 Security\" in the MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application)\n\"IP Filter Function\" of \"6.2 Security Function\" in the MELSEC iQ-R Motion Controller Programming Manual (Common)\n\"IP filter\" of \"1.4 Security\" in the MELSEC iQ-R CC-Link IE TSN User's Manual (Application)\n\"IP filter\" of \"9.5 Security\" in the MELSEC iQ-R CC-Link IE TSN Plus Master/Local Module User\u2019s Manual\n\"14.3 IP Filter Function\" in the Q Corresponding Ethernet Interface Module User's Manual (Basic)\n\"14.3 IP Filter Function\" in the MELSEC-L Ethernet Interface Module User's Manual (Basic)\n\n\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor more information see Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s advisory 2021-031\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n",
