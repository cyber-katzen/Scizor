EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced, WinCC Runtime Professional, WinCC (TIA Portal); HMI Panels\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Insufficient Protection of Credentials, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker with network access to the device to read/write variables via SNMP.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens SIMATIC products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels, 4\u201d \u2013 22\u201d; all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels, 7\u201d & 15\u201d; all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900, KTP900F;\u00a0all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced; all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional; all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal); all versions prior to v15.1 Update 1\nSIMATIC HMI Classic Devices (TP/MP/OP/MP Mobile Panel); all versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected devices offer SNMP read/write capabilities with a hardcoded community string, which may allow an attacker to read/write variables over SNMP. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-6572 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nAn attacker with network access could potentially obtain a TLS session key and use it to decrypt TLS traffic. This could impact the confidentiality of communications between the device and a legitimate user.\nCVE-2019-6576 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\nThe integrated web server could allow a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker is able to modify certain device configuration settings via SNMP. This could impact confidentiality and integrity of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-6577 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens ProductCERT reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has updates at https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109763890/ for the following products:\n\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels, 4\u201d \u2013 22\u201d: Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15.1 Update 1 or newer; then update the panel to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels, 7\u201d & 15\u201d: Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15.1 Update 1 or newer; then update the panel to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\nSIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900, KTP900F\u201d: Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15.1 Update 1 or newer; then update the panel to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced: Update to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: Update to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal): Update to v15.1 Update 1 or newer\n\nSiemens recommends users apply these specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce risk until an update is available or can be applied:\n\nRestrict access to the web interface of the affected devices.\nRestrict access to Port 161/UDP to trusted devices.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends users configure their environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\u00a0\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-307392 at the following location:\u00a0\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
