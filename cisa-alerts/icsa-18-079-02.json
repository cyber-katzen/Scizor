SP3 software can be found here:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109765109\n--------- End Update D Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor all other affected products, Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nApply cell protection concept.\nUse VPN for protecting network communication between cells.\nApply defense-in-depth.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see Siemens security notification SSA-592007 on their website:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
