EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: POWER METER SICAM Q100, POWER METER SICAM Q100\nVulnerabilities: CSRF, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device on behalf of a legitimate user or impersonate that user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA01-2AA1): All versions prior to V2.60\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA31-2AA1): All versions prior to V2.60\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe web interface of the affected devices are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. By tricking an authenticated victim user to click a malicious link, an attacker could perform arbitrary actions on the device on behalf of the victim user.\nCVE-2023-30901\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nAffected devices are missing cookie protection flags when using the default settings. An attacker who gains access to a session token can use it to impersonate a legitimate application user.\nCVE-2023-31238\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA01-2AA1):\n\nCVE-2023-30901: Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at affected devices\nCVE-2023-31238: Restrict access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only\nUpdate to V2.60\u00a0or later version\n\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA31-2AA1):\n\nCVE-2023-30901: Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at affected devices\nCVE-2023-31238: Restrict access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only\nUpdate to V2.60\u00a0or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-480095 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
