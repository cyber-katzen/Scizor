[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAdvantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities=================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-198\\-02OVERVIEW-------- NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT received a report from the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) concerning vulnerabilities affecting the Advantech WebAccess application. These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researchers Dave Weinstein, Tom Gallagher, John Leitch, and others. Advantech has produced an updated software version that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Advantech WebAcess versions are affected:* Advantech WebAcess v7\\.1 and earlier.IMPACT------ An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities in WebAccess may be able to bypass authentication or cause a denial of service. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Advantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide. Advantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web\\-based SCADA and human\\-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, and government facilities. These systems are deployed globally.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWSCWE\\-121: Stack\\-Based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, web site last accessed July 17, 2014\\. There are multiple ways to overflow the static stack buffer by providing overly long strings to specific parameters (namely ProjectName, SetParameter, NodeName, CCDParameter, SetColor, AlarmImage, GetParameter, GetColor, ServerResponse, SetBaud, and IPAddress) within the webvact.ocx, dvs.ocx, and webdact.ocx ActiveX files.

The ChkCookie subroutine within broadweb\\\\include\\\\gChkCook.asp ActiveX control (installed by default as part of setup) allows navigation from the Internet to a local file. If user, proj, and scada are set, and bwuser is set to true, this will grant access to several previously restricted pages. CVE\\-2014\\-2367NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-2367, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

The download link for v7\\.2 is available at:<http://webaccess.advantech.com/> ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
