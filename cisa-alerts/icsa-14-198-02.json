These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researchers Dave Weinstein, Tom Gallagher, John Leitch, and others. Advantech has produced an updated software version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Advantech WebAcess versions are affected:\n\nAdvantech WebAcess v7.1 and earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities in WebAccess may be able to bypass authentication or cause a denial of service.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdvantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.\nAdvantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, and government facilities. These systems are deployed globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWSCWE-121: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed July 17, 2014.\n\nThere are multiple ways to overflow the static stack buffer by providing overly long strings to specific parameters (namely ProjectName, SetParameter, NodeName, CCDParameter, SetColor, AlarmImage, GetParameter, GetColor, ServerResponse, SetBaud, and IPAddress) within the webvact.ocx, dvs.ocx, and webdact.ocx ActiveX files.\nCVE-2014-2364NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2364 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed July 17, 2014.\n\nUNSAFE ACTIVEX CONTROL MARKED SAFE FOR SCRIPTINGCWE-623: Unsafe ActiveX Control Marked Safe For Scripting, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/623.html, web site last accessed July 17, 2014.\n\nThe bwocxrun ActiveX control (installed by default as part of setup) allows navigation from the Internet to a local file. This is accomplished through the BrowseFolder method.\nCVE-2014-2368NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2368, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

If user, proj, and scada are set, and bwuser is set to true, this will grant access to several previously restricted pages.\nCVE-2014-2367NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2367, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed July 17, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nAdvantech released a new WebAccess Installation Package v7.2 on June 6, 2014, that removes some vulnerable ActiveX components and resolves the vulnerabilities within others. The download link for v7.2 is available at:\nhttp://webaccess.advantech.com/\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
