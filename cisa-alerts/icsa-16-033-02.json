[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGE SNMP/Web Interface Vulnerabilities===================================== Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-033\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Karn Ganeshen has identified two vulnerabilities in the GE SNMP/Web Interface adapter. GE has produced a new firmware version to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities in later model devices. Earlier model SNMP/Web Interface adapters may need to be upgraded to accommodate the new firmware version to address the identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SNMP/Web Interface adapter versions are affected:* SNMP/Web Interface adapter, firmware versions prior to Version 4\\.8\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands and to access other users\u2019 sensitive account information potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- GE is a US\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world. The affected product, SNMP/Web Interface adapter, is a web server designed to present information about the uninterruptible power supply (UPS). According to GE, the SNMP/Web Interface is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing and Energy. GE estimates that this product is used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### COMMAND INJECTIONCWE\\-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77\\.html, web site last accessed February 2, 2016\\.

Firmware Version 4\\.8 can be applied to SNMP/Web Interface adapters with the following product numbers: 1024746, 1024747, 1024748, and 1024921\\. GE reports that all other product numbers for SNMP/Web Interface adapters will need to be upgraded to the latest hardware version with Version 4\\.8 to address the identified vulnerabilities. GE recommends that users install the latest SNMP/Web Interface adapter with firmware Version 4\\.8\\. To obtain additional information about solution options, users can contact GE at the following email address:[connectivity\\-ups@ge.com](mailto:connectivity-ups@ge.com)  GE\u2019s Product Bulletin is available at the following URL:<http://geindustrial.com/security> ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Isolate vulnerable systems from the Internet and untrusted systems.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.* Implement a runtime policy to prevent the use of any command that does not appear in a whitelist of allowable commands.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
