EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: InfraSuite Device Master\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Exposed Dangerous Method or Function.\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code and obtain plaintext credentials.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Delta Electronics products are affected:\n\nInfraSuite Device Master: Versions 1.0.7 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-35\nIn Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master v.1.0.7, a vulnerability exists that allows an attacker to write to any file to any location of the filesystem, which could lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-46690\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nIn Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master v.1.0.7, a vulnerability exists that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute code with local administrator privileges.\nCVE-2023-47207\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0EXPOSED DANGEROUS METHOD OR FUNCTION CWE-749\nIn Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master v.1.0.7, a vulnerability exists that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code through a single UDP packet.\nCVE-2023-39226\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-35\nIn Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master v.1.0.7, A vulnerability exists that allows an unauthenticated attacker to disclose user information through a single UDP packet, obtain plaintext credentials, or perform NTLM relaying.\nCVE-2023-47279\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nhir0ot and Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends updating their software to\u00a0v1.0.10\u00a0or later.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
