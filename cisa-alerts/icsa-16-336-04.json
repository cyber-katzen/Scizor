[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAdvantech SUSIAccess Server Vulnerabilities=========================================== Last Revised December 01, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-336\\-04OVERVIEW-------- Researcher rgod working with Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) has identified an information disclosure, a directory traversal, and a privilege escalation vulnerability in Advantech\u2019s SUSIAccess Server. Advantech has produced new software to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SUSIAccess Server versions are affected:* SUISAccess Server Version 3\\.0 and prior.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in file manipulation or arbitrary code execution. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Advantech is a Taiwan\\-based company with distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide. The affected product, SUSIAccess Server, is a platform as a service (PaaS) for cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. According to Advantech, SUSIAccess Server is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Government Facilities. Advantech estimates that this product is used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### **INFORMATION EXPOSURECWE\\-200:Information Exposure, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200\\.html, web site last accessed December 01, 2016\\.** An attacker could traverse the file system and extract files that can result in information disclosure.

To coordinate the purchase of the new software, users should contact Advantech at:[http://www.advantech.com/contact/inquiryrequestform?subject\\=price%2band%2bquotation](http://www.advantech.com/contact/inquiryrequestform?subject=price%2band%2bquotation)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
