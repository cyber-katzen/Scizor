For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.7\nATTENTION:\u00a0High attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens \u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0TIA Project-Server\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Untrusted Search Path\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate privileges when tricking a legitimate user to start the service from an attacker-controlled path.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nTIA Multiuser Server V14: All versions\u00a0\nTIA Multiuser Server V15: All versions prior to V15.1 Update 8\u00a0\nTIA Project-Server: All versions prior to V1.1\u00a0\nTIA Project-Server V16: All versions\u00a0\nTIA Project-Server V17: All versions \u00a0\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0UNTRUSTED SEARCH PATH CWE-426\u00a0\nAffected applications contain an untrusted search path vulnerability that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges when tricking a legitimate user to start the service from an attacker-controlled path.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-35868\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nTIA Project-Server: Update to\u00a0V1.1\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nTIA Multiuser Server V15: Update to\u00a0V15.1\u00a0Update 8 or a later version. Migrate to TIA Project-Server V1.1 or a later version.\u00a0\nTIA Project-Server V16: Currently no fix is available. Migrate to TIA Project-Server V1.1 or a later version.\u00a0\nTIA Project-Server V17: Currently no fix is available. Migrate to TIA Project-Server V1.1 or a later version.\u00a0\nTIA Multiuser Server V14: Currently no fix is planned. Migrate to TIA Project-Server V1.1 or a later version.\u00a0\nEnsure the directory set as working directory when starting the TIA Project-Server or TIA Multiuser Server does not contain untrusted files.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for\u00a0Industrial Security\u00a0and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security website. \u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT. \u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-640968 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\u00a0\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
