EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: PI Server\nVulnerabilities: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash the product being accessed or throttle the memory leading to a partial denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of AVEVA PI Server, are affected:\n\nPI Server: 2023\nPI Server: 2018 SP3 P05 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER CHECK OR HANDLING OF EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE-703\nAVEVA PI Server versions 2023 and 2018 SP3 P05 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to remotely crash the PI Message Subsystem of a PI Server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-34348\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0MISSING RELEASE OF RESOURCE AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE-772\nAVEVA PI Server versions 2023 and 2018 SP3 P05 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to cause the PI Message Subsystem of a PI Server to consume available memory resulting in throttled processing of new PI Data Archive events and a partial denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-31274\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAVEVA reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAll affected versions can be fixed by upgrading to AVEVA PI Server version 2023 Patch 1 or later. From\u00a0OSI Soft Customer Portal, search for \"PI Server\" and select version \"2023 Patch 1\".\nFor an alternative fix, AVEVA PI Server 2018 SP3 Patch 5 and prior can be fixed by deploying AVEVA PI Server version 2018 SP3 Patch 6 or later. From\u00a0OSI Soft Customer Portal, search for \"PI Server\" and select version \"2018 SP3 Patch 6\".\nAVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Users with the affected products should apply security updates as soon as possible.\nAVEVA recommends the following defensive measures:\n\nSet the PI Message Subsystem to auto restart.\nMonitor the memory usage of the PI Message Subsystem.\nLimit network access to port 5450 to trusted workstations and software\nConfirm that only authorized users have access to write to the PI Server Message Log. This is done through configuration of the PIMSGSS entry within the Database Security plugin accessible through PI System Management Tools.\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, including security updates, users should see security bulletin\u00a0AVEVA-2024-001.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
