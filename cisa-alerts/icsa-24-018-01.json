MITIGATIONS--------------- All affected versions can be fixed by upgrading to AVEVA PI Server version 2023 Patch 1 or later. From [OSI Soft Customer Portal](https://my.osisoft.com/)  , search for \"PI Server\" and select version \"2023 Patch 1\". For an alternative fix, AVEVA PI Server 2018 SP3 Patch 5 and prior can be fixed by deploying AVEVA PI Server version 2018 SP3 Patch 6 or later. From [OSI Soft Customer Portal](https://my.osisoft.com/)  , search for \"PI Server\" and select version \"2018 SP3 Patch 6\". AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Users with the affected products should apply security updates as soon as possible. AVEVA recommends the following defensive measures:* Set the PI Message Subsystem to auto restart.* Monitor the memory usage of the PI Message Subsystem.* Limit network access to port 5450 to trusted workstations and software* Confirm that only authorized users have access to write to the PI Server Message Log. This is done through configuration of the PIMSGSS entry within the Database Security plugin accessible through PI System Management Tools. For more information on this vulnerability, including security updates, users should see security bulletin [AVEVA\\-2024\\-001](https://www.aveva.com/content/dam/aveva/documents/support/cyber-security-updates/SecurityBulletin_AVEVA-2024-001.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
