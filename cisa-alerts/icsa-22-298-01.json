[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHaas Controller=============== Last Revised October 25, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-298\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Haas Automation, Inc* **Equipment:**  Haas Controller* **Vulnerabilities:**  Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Insufficient Granularity of Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized attacker to cause denial\\-of\\-service of the production line, damage the tools used in the production line, introduce defects in pieces of the production line, and perform remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of the Haas Controller, a Computer Numerical Control (CNC), are affected:* Haas Controller: Version 100\\.20\\.000\\.1110### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) Authentication is currently unsupported in Haas Controller version 100\\.20\\.000\\.1110 when using the \u201cEthernet Q Commands\u201d service, which allows any user on the same network segment as the controller (even while connected remotely) to access the service and write unauthorized macros to the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-2474](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2475)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INSUFFICIENT GRANULARITY OF ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-1220](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1220.html) Haas Controller version 100\\.20\\.000\\.1110 has insufficient granularity of access control when using the \"Ethernet Q Commands\" service. Any user is able to write macros into registers outside of the authorized accessible range. This could allow a user to access privileged resources or resources out of context.[CVE\\-2022\\-2475](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2475)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html) Communication traffic involving \"Ethernet Q Commands\" service of Haas Controller version 100\\.20\\.000\\.1110 is transmitted in cleartext. This allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information being passed to and from the controller.[CVE\\-2022\\-41636](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41636)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Marco Balduzzi of Trend Micro and Francesco Sortino from Celada Spa reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Haas Automation recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Locate control system devices and/or systems behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* Ensure physical access controls are in place; only authorized end\\-users should have access to control systems. The researcher recommends the following workarounds to reduce risk:* Add authentication to the \u201cEthernet Q Commands\u201d service and use a strong enforced password.* Add encryption where possible to prevent data sniffing and capturing of the authentication password.* Limit the number of macros that can be written. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
