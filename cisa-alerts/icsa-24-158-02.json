EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Emerson\nEquipment: Ovation\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n\nCISA is aware of a public report, known as \"OT:ICEFALL\", detailing vulnerabilities found in multiple operational technology (OT) vendors. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution, loss of sensitive information, denial-of-service, or allow an attacker to modify the controller configuration.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Emerson products are affected:\n\nOvation: Version 3.8.0 Feature Pack 1 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected product has several protocols that have no authentication, which could allow an attacker to change controller configuration or cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2022-29966 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2022-29966. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345\nThe affected product was found to have no authentication of firmware signing and relies on an insecure checksum for integrity. This could allow an attacker to push malicious firmware images, cause a denial-of-service condition, or achieve remote code execution.\nCVE-2022-30267 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2022-30267. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDaniel dos Santos and Jos Wetzels from Forescout Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to CISA\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEmerson recommends the following:\n\nUpgrade to the currently available release of Ovation 3.8.0 Feature Pack 3 for remediation of many of the identified vulnerabilities.\nUsers are advised to consider the use of OCR3000 controllers, which offer an extra layer of protection that is not available to older controller models.\nDeploy and configure Ovation systems and related components as described in the Cybersecurity for Ovation Systems manual (OVREF1000). Ovation Users' Group Website (User Manuals | Reference Manuals) (login required)\nUsers with questions or concerns regarding the impact of these vulnerabilities on Ovation should contact theOvation-CERT by email or phone (1-800-445-9723, option 3).\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
