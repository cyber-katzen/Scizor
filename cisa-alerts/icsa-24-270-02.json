EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: ADAM-5630\nVulnerabilities: Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack a legitimate user's session, perform cross-site request forgery, or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Advantech's ADAM are affected:\n\nAdvantech ADAM-5630: versions prior to v2.5.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 USE OF PERSISTENT COOKIES CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-539\nCookies of authenticated users remain as active valid cookies when a session is closed. Forging requests with a legitimate cookie, even if the session was terminated, allows an unauthorized attacker to act with the same level of privileges of the legitimate user.\nCVE-2024-39275 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39275. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nCross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.\nCVE-2024-28948 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-28948. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3 WEAK ENCODING FOR PASSWORD CWE-261\nUser credentials are shared in plain text, between the device and the user source device, during the login process.\nCVE-2024-34542 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-34542. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.4 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe device has built-in commands that can be executed without authenticating the user. These commands allow for restarting the operating system, rebooting the hardware, and stopping the execution. The commands can be sent to a simple HTTP request and are executed by the device automatically, without discrimination of origin or level of privileges of the user sending the commands.\nCVE-2024-39364 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39364. A base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez and Luis Villalba P\u00e9rez of S21sec reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech recommends users upgrade their ADAM-5630 devices to version 2.5.2.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nSeptember 26, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
