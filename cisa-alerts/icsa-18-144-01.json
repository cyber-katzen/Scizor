A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems* **Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location:**  France### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Schneider Electric reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric recommends that users of affected Citect and PlantStruxure products download and install the new version of the software located at:[https://www.citect.schneider\\-electric.com/documents/downloads/Floating\\_License\\_Manager\\_v2\\.1\\.0\\.0\\.zip](https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/documents/downloads/Floating_License_Manager_v2.1.0.0.zip)  Users using EcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3\\.0 are recommended to download and use the new version (V3\\.1\\) located at:[https://partner.schneider\\-electric.com/partners/Menu/MyPartnership](https://partner.schneider-electric.com/partners/Menu/MyPartnership)  (login required) StructureWare 7\\.2\\.x users should upgrade to Version 7\\.2\\.2 and apply the floating licensing manager (FLM) patch from the following location:[https://schneider\\-electric.box.com/s/n2fh1ym594pqvl87kf0zjsigamuryrje](https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/n2fh1ym594pqvl87kf0zjsigamuryrje)  EcoStruxure/StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert and Power SCADA Operations users need to upgrade to Version 8\\.2\\. Energy Expert users need to upgrade to Version 1\\.3\\. Once these are upgraded apply the Cumulative Update (CU) 2 located at:[https://schneider\\-electric.box.com/s/kkdikodcksjj1dznqy68ko0j28wct7vb](https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/kkdikodcksjj1dznqy68ko0j28wct7vb)  Schneider Electric has also released security notifications which contain further details and upgrade instructions at the following links:[https://www.citect.schneider\\-electric.com/safety\\-and\\-security\\-central/36\\-security\\-notifications/9134\\-vulnerabilities\\-within\\-schneider\\-electric\\-floating\\-license\\-manager](https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/safety-and-security-central/36-security-notifications/9134-vulnerabilities-within-schneider-electric-floating-license-manager) [https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2018\\-137\\-01/](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-137-01/) [https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2018\\-144\\-01/](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-144-01/) [https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2018\\-046\\-01/](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-046-01/)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
