EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: Floating License Manager\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Open Redirect\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial of service, allow arbitrary execution of code with system level privileges, or send users to arbitrary websites.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products use the vulnerable Schneider Electric Floating License Manager, a license management platform:\n\nSCADA Expert Vijeo Citect / CitectSCADA Version 7.30, 7.40,\nCitectSCADA Version 2015, 2016,\nVijeo Historian/CitectHistorian Version 4.40, 4.50,\nCitectHistorian Version 2016,\nCitect Anywhere,\nPlantStruxure PES V4.3 SP1 and prior, and\nEcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3.0 and prior.\n\nThe following products are only affected by CVE-2016-10395:\n\nEcoStruxure Power Monitoring Expert 8.2 (Standard, DC, HC Editions),\nStruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 8.1 (Standard, DC, HC Editions),\nStruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 8.0 (Standard, DC, HC, Buildings Editions),\nStruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 7.2.x,\nEnergy Expert 1.x (formerly Power Manager), and\nEcoStruxure Power SCADA Operations 8.x (formerly PowerSCADA Expert) (Only with Advanced Reports and Dashboards Module).\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nOpenSSL incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which may allow denial of service attacks or other unspecified behavior.\nCVE-2016-2177 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThis vulnerability can be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds memory read access, which may allow remote code execution with system privileges.\nCVE-2016-10395 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3 URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601\nAn open redirect vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites for phishing attacks.\nCVE-2017-5571 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSchneider Electric reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric recommends that users of affected Citect and PlantStruxure products download and install the new version of the software located at:\nhttps://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/documents/downloads/Floating_License_Manager_v2.1.0.0.zip\nUsers using EcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3.0 are recommended to download and use the new version (V3.1) located at:\nhttps://partner.schneider-electric.com/partners/Menu/MyPartnership (login required)\nStructureWare 7.2.x users should upgrade to Version 7.2.2 and apply the floating licensing manager (FLM) patch from the following location:\nhttps://schneider-electric.box.com/s/n2fh1ym594pqvl87kf0zjsigamuryrje\nEcoStruxure/StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert and Power SCADA Operations users need to upgrade to Version 8.2. Energy Expert users need to upgrade to Version 1.3. Once these are upgraded apply the Cumulative Update (CU) 2 located at:\nhttps://schneider-electric.box.com/s/kkdikodcksjj1dznqy68ko0j28wct7vb\nSchneider Electric has also released security notifications which contain further details and upgrade instructions at the following links:\nhttps://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/safety-and-security-central/36-security-notifications/9134-vulnerabilities-within-schneider-electric-floating-license-manager\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-137-01/\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-144-01/\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-046-01/\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
