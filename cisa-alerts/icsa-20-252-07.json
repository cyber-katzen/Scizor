A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nAlyssa Milburn, Hany Ragab, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU Amsterdam reported this vulnerability to Intel.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating the following products to the most current BIOS version where available:\n\nSIMATIC Field PG M5: Update BIOS to v22.01.08\nSIMATIC Field PG M6: Update BIOS to v26.01.07\nSIMATIC IPC427E, IPC477E, IPC477E Pro: Update BIOS to v21.01.14\nSIMATIC IPC527G: Update BIOS to R1.4.0\nSIMATIC IPC547G: Update BIOS to R1.28.0\nSIMATIC IPC627E, IPC647E, IPC677E, and IPC847E: Update BIOS to v25.02.06\nSIMATIC ITP1000: Update BIOS to v23.01.08\n\n--------- Begin Update F Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC IPC3000 SMART v2: Update BIOS to v1.B or later version\n\n--------- End Update F Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens is preparing further updates and recommends the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk until fixes are available.\n\nAs a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems. Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.\nApplying a defense-in-depth concept can help to reduce the probability that untrusted code is run on the system. Siemens recommends applying the defense-in-depth concept.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/Industrialsecurity\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and the associated mitigations, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-534763\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
