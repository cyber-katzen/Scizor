For the most up\\-to\\-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services \\| Services \\| Siemens Global).](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Nucleus Real\\-Time Operating System (RTOS) FTP Server* **Vulnerability:**  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-22\\-286\\-07 Siemens Nucleus RTOS FTP Server that was published October 13, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial\\-of\\-service condition on devices running the affected software.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Nucleus RTOS components contain the affected File Transport Protocol (FTP) server:* Nucleus NET: All versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Nucleus ReadyStart V3: All versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Nucleus Source Code: Versions including affected FTP server### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  The FTP server does not properly release memory resources reserved for incomplete connection attempts by FTP clients. This could allow a remote attacker to generate a denial\\-of\\-service condition on devices incorporating a vulnerable version of the FTP server.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** [CVE\\-2022\\-38371](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-38371)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software where available:* Nucleus NET: No fix available \u2013 users should follow general security measures for mitigation.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Nucleus ReadyStart V3: Update to [V2017\\.02\\.4 and apply the patch \"2017\\.02\\.4\\_patch\\_CVE\\-2022\\-38371\"](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/1009925838/downloads)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Nucleus Source Code: Contact [Siemens (login required)](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/signin)  to receive update information**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Configure TCP\\_MAX\\_KEEPALIVES to a lower value such as 3\\.* Configure TCP\\_KEEPALIVE\\_INTERVAL and TCP\\_KEEPALIVE\\_DELAY be set to 3 seconds.* Rebuild the application.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals.
