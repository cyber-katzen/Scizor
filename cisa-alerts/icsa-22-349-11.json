This could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition on ports 443/TCP and 4443/TCP for a duration.\nCVE-2022-45044 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated. the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing \u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nRestrict access to ports 443/TCP and 4443/TCP to trusted only IP addresses.\n\nOperators of critical power systems worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. Therefore, Siemens recommends operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design. \u00a0\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update prior to application, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-408105 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
