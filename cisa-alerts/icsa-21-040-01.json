MITIGATIONS--------------- GE Digital recommends users immediately upgrade all instances of the affected software to GE Digital\u2019s iFIX product v6\\.5\\. GE Digital believes the upgrade contains security enhancements that will help mitigate the risk that the vulnerabilities may be exploited by an attacker. Please contact your GE Digital Channel representative or email [gedigitalsalesupport@ge.com](mailto:gedigitalsalesupport@ge.com)  GE Digital also recommends the following for further reduction of risk:* Follow the iFIX Secure Deployment Guide: [Customer Page](https://ge-ip.my.salesforce.com/kA31A000000TdOq)  or [Partner Page](https://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Documentation/iFIX-Secure-Deployment-Guide?Type=Documentation__kav&Id=ka30h0000004dOO)  . For more information refer to [GE Digital Product Security Advisory](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/GE-Digital-Security-Advisory-GED-21-01)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Restrict access to the device by following least privilege principles. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
