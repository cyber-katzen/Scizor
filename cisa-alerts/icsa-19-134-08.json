This may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-10916 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION CWE-248\nAn attacker with local access to the project file could cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected product as the project file is loaded. Successful exploitation could compromise availability of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-10917 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSED DANGEROUS METHOD OR FUNCTION CWE-749\nAn authenticated attacker with network access to the DCOM interface could execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation could compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-10918 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nVladimir Dashchenko and Sergey Temnikov from Kaspersky Lab, CNCERT/CC, and ChengBin Wang from Guoli Security Technology reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has an update available for the following affected products:\n--------- Begin Update D Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal v14): Update to v14 SP1 Upd 9\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal v15): Update to v15.1 Upd 3\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v14: Update to v14.1 Upd 8\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v15: Update to v15.1 Upd 3\n\n---------- End Update D Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC PCS7 v8.1: Update WinCC to v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC PCS7 v8.2: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC PCS7 v9.0: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.3: Update WinCC to v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.4: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.5: Update WinCC to v7.5 Upd 3\n\nSiemens recommends users apply the following specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce risk until updates or patches are available:\n\nApply defense-in-depth strategies.\nEnable \u201cEncrypted communication\u201d in SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS7.\nOnly open project files from trusted locations.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure their environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\u00a0\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-697412 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
