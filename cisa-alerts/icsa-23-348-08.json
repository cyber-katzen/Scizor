EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC CP, SINAMICS, SIPLUS NET CP\nVulnerability: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized attacker with network access to the web server of an affected device to perform a denial-of-service attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC CP 1242-7 V2 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1243-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1243-1 DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1243-1 IEC (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1243-7 LTE: All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC (6GK7243-8RX30-0XE0): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 1543-1 (6GK7543-1AX00-0XE0): All versions\nSINAMICS S210 (6SL5...): Versions V6.1 up to but not including V6.1 HF2\nSIPLUS NET CP 1543-1 (6AG1543-1AX00-2XE0): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING RELEASE OF MEMORY AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE-401\nThe webserver implementation of the affected products does not correctly release allocated memory after it has been used. An attacker with network access could use this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the webserver of the affected product.\nCVE-2023-38380\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released a new version for SINAMICS S210 (6SL5...) and\nrecommends users update to the latest version. Siemens is preparing\nfurther fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for\nproducts where fixes are not, or not yet available.\n\nSINAMICS S210 (6SL5...):\u00a0Update to V6.1 HF2\u00a0or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nRestrict network access to the integrated webserver\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-693975 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
