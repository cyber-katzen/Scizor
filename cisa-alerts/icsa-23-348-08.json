EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : SIMATIC CP, SINAMICS, SIPLUS NET CP* **Vulnerability**  : Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized attacker with network access to the web server of an affected device to perform a denial\\-of\\-service attack.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* SIMATIC CP 1242\\-7 V2 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC CP 1243\\-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC CP 1243\\-1 DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC CP 1243\\-1 IEC (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC CP 1243\\-7 LTE: All versions* SIMATIC CP 1243\\-8 IRC (6GK7243\\-8RX30\\-0XE0\\): All versions* SIMATIC CP 1543\\-1 (6GK7543\\-1AX00\\-0XE0\\): All versions* SINAMICS S210 (6SL5\\...): Versions V6\\.1 up to but not including V6\\.1 HF2* SIPLUS NET CP 1543\\-1 (6AG1543\\-1AX00\\-2XE0\\): All versions### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [MISSING RELEASE OF MEMORY AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE\\-401](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/401.html)** The webserver implementation of the affected products does not correctly release allocated memory after it has been used. An attacker with network access could use this vulnerability to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition in the webserver of the affected product.[CVE\\-2023\\-38380](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38380)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released a new version for SINAMICS S210 (6SL5\\...) and recommends users update to the latest version. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.* SINAMICS S210 (6SL5\\...): [Update to V6\\.1 HF2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109825153/)  or later version Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Restrict network access to the integrated webserver As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-693975 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-693975.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-693975.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
