A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862\nAn attacker with network access to Port 80/TCP can change user-defined event properties without proper authorization.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-6582 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens PSIRT reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released the following updates to the Siveillance VMS products:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02017 R2 v11.2a\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02018 R1 v12.1a\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02018 R2 v12.2a\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02018 R3 v12.3a\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02019 R1 v13.1a\nUpdates can be found at:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/ps/24899/dl\nSiemens also recommends applying the following specific mitigation to reduce risk:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Block Port 80/TCP at an external firewall.\nFor more information please see Siemens security advisory SSA-212009.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
