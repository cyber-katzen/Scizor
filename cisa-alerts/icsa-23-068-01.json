RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause loss of sensitive information, unauthorized access, and grant full administrative control to an attacker.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Akuvox E11, a doorbell camera phone, are affected:\n\nE11: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0GENERATION OF PREDICTABLE IV WITH CBC CWE-329\nAkuvox E11 contains a function that encrypts messages which are then forwarded. The IV vector and the key are static, and this may allow an attacker to decrypt messages.\nCVE-2023-0343\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nAkuvox E11 uses a hard-coded cryptographic key, which could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information.\nCVE-2023-0355\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe Akuvox E11 web server can be accessed without any user authentication, and this could allow an attacker to access sensitive information, as well as create and download packet captures with known default URLs.\nCVE-2023-0354\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE-257\nAkuvox E11 uses a weak encryption algorithm for stored passwords and uses a hard-coded password for decryption which could allow the encrypted passwords to be decrypted from the configuration file.\nCVE-2023-0353\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WEAK PASSWORD RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR FORGOTTEN PASSWORD CWE-640\nThe Akuvox E11 password recovery webpage can be accessed without authentication, and an attacker could download the device key file. An attacker could then use this page to reset the password back to the default.\nCVE-2023-0352\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-94\nThe Akuvox E11 web server backend library allows command injection in the device phone-book contacts functionality. This could allow an attacker to upload files with executable command instructions.\nCVE-2023-0351\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELIANCE ON FILE NAME OR EXTENSION OF EXTERNALLY-SUPPLIED FILE CWE-646\nAkuvox E11 does not ensure that a file extension is associated with the file provided. This could allow an attacker to upload a file to the device by changing the extension of a malicious file to an accepted file type.\nCVE-2023-0350\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862\nThe Akuvox E11 libvoice library provides unauthenticated access to the camera capture for image and video. This could allow an attacker to view and record image and video from the camera.\nCVE-2023-0349\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nAkuvox E11 allows direct SIP calls. No access control is enforced by the SIP servers, which could allow an attacker to contact any device within Akuvox to call any other device.\nCVE-2023-0348\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nThe Akuvox E11 Media Access Control (MAC) address, a primary identifier, combined with the Akuvox E11 IP address, could allow an attacker to identify the device on the Akuvox cloud.\nCVE-2023-0347\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nAkuvox E11 cloud login is performed through an unencrypted HTTP connection. An attacker could gain access to the Akuvox cloud and device if the MAC address of a device if known.\nCVE-2023-0346\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.12\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe Akuvox E11 secure shell (SSH) server is enabled by default and can be accessed by the root user.

A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.13\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITY CWE-912\nAkuvox E11 appears to be using a custom version of dropbear SSH server. This server allows an insecure option that by default is not in the official dropbear SSH server.\nCVE-2023-0344\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0China\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVera Mens and Amir Preminger of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUsers should\u00a0contact Akuvox\u00a0for more information on these vulnerabilities.\nCISA recommends users disconnect Akuvox E11 devices from the internet until these vulnerabilities are fixed. If this is not possible, users should ensure that the camera is not recording any sensitive information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
