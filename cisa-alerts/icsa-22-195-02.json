[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SICAM GridEdge====================== Last Revised July 14, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-195\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SICAM GridEdge* **Vulnerability:**  Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- The SICAM GridEdge software contains an improper access control vulnerability, which could allow persons with local access to the host system to inject an SSH key.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SICAM GridEdge are affected:* SICAM GridEdge Essential ARM (6MD7881\\-2AA30\\): All versions.* SICAM GridEdge Essential Intel (6MD7881\\-2AA40\\): All versions prior to v2\\.7\\.3* SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS ARM (6MD7881\\-2AA10\\): All versions.* SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS Intel(6MD7881\\-2AA20\\): All versions prior to v2\\.7\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3\\.2\\.1 [EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE\\-668](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/668.html)  Affected software uses an improperly protected file to import SSH keys. Attackers with access to the filesystem of the host on which SICAM GridEdge runs can inject a custom SSH key to that file.[CVE\\-2022\\-34464](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34464)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software:* SICAM GridEdge Essential ARM: No fix is currently planned.* SICAM GridEdge Essential Intel: Update to [v2\\.7\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109780559/)* SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS ARM: Currently no fix is planned.* SICAM GridEdge Essential with GDS Intel: Update to [v2\\.7\\.3 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109780559/) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* If possible, restrict physical access to the device and limit access to the SSH port (22/TCP) to trusted IP addresses As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information, see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-225578](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-225578.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
