This web page release was delayed to allow users time to download and install the update.\nIndependent researcher Celil Unuver from SignalSec Corporation has identified two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the WWCabFile component of the Wonderware System Platform, which is used by multiple applications that run on the platform. Invensys has produced a patch that resolves these vulnerabilities. Mr. Unuver has tested the patch and verified that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nThe following Invensys products and versions are affected:\n\nWonderware Application Server 2012 and all prior versions\nFoxboro Control Software Version 3.1 and all prior versions\nInFusion CE/FE/SCADA 2.5 and all prior versions\nWonderware Information Server 4.5 and all prior versions\nArchestrA Application Object Toolkit 3.2 and all prior versions\nInTouch 10.0 to 10.5 only (earlier versions of InTouch are not affected).\n\nNOTE: The Wonderware Historian is part of the System Platform but is not affected by this Security Update.\nImpact\nSuccessfully exploiting these vulnerabilities will cause a buffer overflow that may allow remote code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on theiroperational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nWonderware System Platform, along with the Foxboro Control Software, is used for designing, building, deploying, and maintaining standardized applications for manufacturing and infrastructure operations.\nThe Wonderware Information Server is a component of the System Platform and is used for aggregating and presenting plant production and performance data.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nHeap-Based Buffer Overflowhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html, website last accessed March 30, 2012.\nA heap-based overflow can be used to overwrite function pointers that exist in memory with pointers to the attacker\u2019s code. Applications that do not explicitly use function pointers are still vulnerable, as unrelated run-time programs can leave operational function pointers in memory.\nThe heap-based buffer overflow in WWCabFile ActiveX Component can be exploited by sending a long string of data to the \u201cOpen\u201d member of the WWCabFile component.\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Identifier CVE-2012-0257 has been assigned to this vulnerability. According to Invensys, a CVSS V2 base score of 6.0 has also been assigned.\nHeap-Based Buffer Overflow\nThe heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited by sending a long data string to the \u201cAddFile\u201d member of the WWCabFile component.\nCVE Identifier CVE-2012-0258 has been assigned to this vulnerability. According to Invensys, a CVSS V2 base score of 6.0 has also been assigned.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities require user interaction to exploit, possibly by social engineering.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nInvensys has rated these vulnerabilities as a medium concern based on exploit difficulty and the potential that social engineering may be required.\nMitigation\nInvensys encourages users affected by these vulnerabilities to follow the instructions in their security bulletin.\nInstallation of the Security Update does not require a reboot. If multiple products are installed on the same node, the customer need only install the Security Update once.\nTo install the update, Invensys recommends users to follow the instructions found in the ReadMe file for the product and component being installed. In general, Invensys recommends that users:\n\nBack up the Galaxy Database\nBack up the Wonderware Information Server Database\nRun the Security Update Utility.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
