Low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  FATEK Automation**Equipment:**  PLC Ethernet Module**Vulnerability:**  Stack\\-based buffer overflowAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The affected Ether\\_cfg software configuration tool runs on the following Fatek PLCs:* CBEH versions prior to V3\\.6 Build 170215,* CBE versions prior to V3\\.6 Build 170215,* CM55E versions prior to V3\\.6 Build 170215, and* CM25E versions prior to V3\\.6 Build 170215\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to crash the affected device or allow remote code execution.MITIGATION---------- FATEK Automation has created a new version of the \u201cether\\_cfg software tool\u201d to mitigate this vulnerability. This file is available to download at:[http://www.fatek.com/en/technical.php?act\\=software\\&catId\\=12](http://www.fatek.com/en/technical.php?act=software&catId=12)  For more information about this vulnerability and how to mitigate it, please see the Fatek EtherConfig release note on the Fatek technical support web page:[http://www.fatek.com/en/technical.php?act\\=software\\&catId\\=1](http://www.fatek.com/en/technical.php?act=software&catId=1)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote code execution or crash the affected device.[CVE\\-2017\\-6023](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6023)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
