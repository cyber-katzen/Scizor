These vulnerabilities were reported directly to Siemens by Dmitry Sklyarov and Gleb Gritsai from Positive Technologies. Siemens has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal):\n\nSIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal): All versions prior to V14\n\nIMPACT\nA local attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities may be able to access sensitive information contained in TIA Portal project files under certain conditions.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected product, SIMATIC Step 7 (TIA Portal), is engineering software for SIMATIC products. According to Siemens, SIMATIC Step 7 (TIA Portal) is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that this product is used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTHCWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html, web site last accessed October 13, 2016.\n\nLocal attackers with read access to TIA Portal project files could brute-force preshared keys used for machine-to-machine communication with possibly reduced effort.\nCVE-2016-7959NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-7959, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed October 13, 2016.\n\nCRYPTOGRAPHIC ISSUESCWE-310: Cryptographic Issues, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html, web site last accessed October 13, 2016.\n\nLocal attackers could circumvent the protection of the transport format of TIA Portal project files and potentially access sensitive configuration settings. This format is used by TIA Portal during the migration of project files to a new version (e.g., V12 to V13).\nCVE-2016-7960NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-7960, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed October 13, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would be difficult.\nMITIGATION\nAccess to the TIA Portal project files on engineering workstations or network storage must be protected with appropriate mechanisms from unauthorized access.\nSiemens provides SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) V14, which fixes the vulnerabilities and recommends users migrate projects to the new version. It can be found at the following location on the Siemens web site:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109740340\nSiemens strongly recommends users protect network access to engineering workstations and project storage with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens also advises that users configure the operational environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-869766 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Generally, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
