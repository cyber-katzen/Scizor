MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends the following:\n\nJT2Go: Update to v13.1.0.1 or later (login required).\nTeamcenter Visualization: Update to v13.1.0.1 or later (login required).\nLimiting the opening of untrusted files in systems where JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization is installed.\nApplying a defense-in-depth concept can help to reduce the probability for an untrusted code to run on the system.\u00a0\nFor additional information refer to SSA-622830 and SSA-663999\nFor additional information concerning Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK issues refer to Open Design Alliance\u2019s Security Advisories.\n\nSiemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/Industrialsecurity\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
