EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager* **Vulnerabilities:**  Incorrect Default Permissions, Unquoted Search Path or Element2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a privileged local user to escalate privileges.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager:* SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager, all versions prior to v2\\.10\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html) The start\\-stop scripts for the services of the affected application could allow a local attacker to include arbitrary commands that are executed when services are started or stopped interactively by system administrators.[CVE\\-2020\\-10049](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10049)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html) The directory of service executables of the affected application could allow a local attacker to include arbitrary commands that are executed with SYSTEM privileges when the system restarts.[CVE\\-2020\\-10050](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10050)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [UNQUOTED SEARCH PATH OR ELEMENT CWE\\-428](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/428.html) Multiple services of the affected application are executed with SYSTEM privileges while the call path is not quoted. This could allow a local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed instead of the legitimate service.[CVE\\-2020\\-10051](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10051)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends that users apply the update of the SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager: [v2\\.10\\.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109781166)  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply security hardening of the Windows Server, where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed on, in accordance with your corporate security policies or up\\-to\\-date hardening guidelines.* Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional local accounts on the server. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
