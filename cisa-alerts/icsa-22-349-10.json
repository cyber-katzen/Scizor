EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment: APOGEE PXC/TALON TC\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack existing sessions or spoof future sessions.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products from Siemens are affected:\n\nAPOGEE PXC Series (BACnet): All versions prior to 3.5.5\nAPOGEE PXC Series (P2 Ethernet): All versions prior to 2.8.20\nTALON TC Series (BACnet): All versions prior to 3.5.5\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PREDICTABLE EXACT VALUE FROM PREVIOUS VALUES CWE-342\nInitial sequence numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source; the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future sessions.\nCVE-2020-28388 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated. the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing \u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAPOGEE PXC Series (P2 Ethernet): Update to V2.8.20 or later versions\nAPOGEE PXC Series (BACnet): Update to V3.5.5 or later versions\nTALON TC Series (BACnet): Update to V3.5.5 or later versions\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-408105 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
