EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Advantech\nEquipment:\u00a0WebAccess Node\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to arbitrarily overwrite files resulting in remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Advantech products are affected:\n\nWebAccess/SCADA versions 9.1.3 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nIn Advantech WebAccss/SCADA v9.1.3 and prior, there is an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to overwrite any file in the operating system (including system files), inject code into an XLS file, and modify the file extension, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2023-32540 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nIn Advantech WebAccss/SCADA v9.1.3 and prior, there is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that could allow an attacker to upload an ASP script file to a webserver when logged in as manager user, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2023-22450 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nIn Advantech WebAccss/SCADA v9.1.3 and prior, there is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that could allow an attacker to modify the file extension of a certificate file to ASP when uploading it, which can lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-32628 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0East Asia, Europe, United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Tawain\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYangLiu from Elex Feigong Research Institute reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech recommends WebAccess/SCADA users upgrade to v9.1.4.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
