EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.7*** **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  PCM600 Update Manager* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Certificate Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the certificate validation and install an untrusted software package.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of PCM600 Update Manager, an update manager for the PCM600 software (a protection and control IED manager), are affected:* PCM600 Update Manager: Versions 2\\.1, 2\\.1\\.0\\.4, 2\\.2, 2\\.2\\.0\\.1, 2\\.2\\.0\\.2, 2\\.2\\.0\\.23, 2\\.3\\.0\\.60, 2\\.4\\.20041\\.1, and 2\\.4\\.20119\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE\\-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) This vulnerability exists due to a logic error in the certificate validation in the affected product. An attacker with administrator rights could exploit this vulnerability by creating software packages and signing those packages with specially crafted certificates, thereby pointing the PCM600 update server location to a different location. The validation flaw causes untrusted software packages to be installed using PCM600 Update Manager.[CVE\\-2021\\-22278](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22278)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER A Department of Energy CyTRICS researcher from Idaho National Laboratory reported this vulnerability to Hitachi Energy.4\\.
