EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: WebAccess\nVulnerabilities: Code Injection, Command Injection, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, access files and perform actions at a privileged level, or delete files on the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of WebAccess, an HMI platform, are affected:\n\nWebAccess Versions 8.4.1 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CODE INJECTION CWE-94\nAn exploit executed over the network may cause improper control of generation of code, which may allow remote code execution, data exfiltration, or cause a system crash.\nCVE-2019-13558 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\nMultiple command injection vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data and may allow arbitrary file deletion and remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-13552 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-13556 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nAn improper authorization vulnerability may allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information, cause improper control of generation of code, which may allow remote code execution or cause a system crash.\nCVE-2019-13550 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: East Asia, United States, and Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPeter Cheng of Elex CyberSecurity Inc.; ADLab of VenusTech; and Mat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech has released Version 8.4.2 of WebAccessNode to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccessNode at the following location:\nhttps://support.advantech.com/support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-MS9MJV&Doc_Source=Download\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
