Meinberg has produced a new Version 6.20.004 to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The researcher has validated the firmware update. He confirms the update fixes these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Meinberg products are affected:\n\nIMS-LANTIME M3000 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nIMS-LANTIME M1000 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nIMS-LANTIME M500 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M900 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M600 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M400 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M300 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M200 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nLANTIME M100 Version 6.0 and earlier,\nSyncFire 1100 Version 6.0 and earlier, and\nLCES Version 6.0 and earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a buffer overflow condition that may allow escalation to root privileges.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMeinberg is a Germany-based company that maintains offices around the world, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.\nThe affected products are NTP Time Servers. According to Meinberg, IMS-LANTIME, LANTIME, SyncFire, and LCES Series are deployed across several sectors including Communications, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, Financial Services, Transportation Systems, and others. Meinberg estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed June 23, 2016.\n\nRemote stack buffer overflow vulnerability involving parsing of parameter in POST request in function provides privilege of web server \u201cnobody.\u201d\nCVE-2016-3962NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-3962, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

The new firmware can be downloaded by using the link below:\nhttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.meinberg.de_download_firmware_lantime_v6_firmware-2D6.20.004-2Dx86.rel&d=BQIFaQ&c=54IZrppPQZKX9mLzcGdPfFD1hxrcB__aEkJFOKJFd00&r=zE5lG3CZZIbdBvT6slVAzQ&m=n4ZBSsrF-RphS7eiqohm3WcJ2BYQUCwQUHwVPHNFa6o&s=WlQnlBzw05tnJ1o29nmeXtGBbNubzjyRPqaWAdpXn5Y&e=\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
