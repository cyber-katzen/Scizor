MITIGATIONS--------------- When applicable, Hitachi Energy recommends users update to Lumada APM Edge v6\\.3 at the earliest convenience. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a network from attacks originating outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.* Ensure process control systems have no direct connections to the internet.* Use firewall systems to separate process control systems from other networks.* Ensure the firewall system only has necessary ports exposed. APM should only be used to access the internet for authorized information. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system. For more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory [8DBD000115](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000115)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
