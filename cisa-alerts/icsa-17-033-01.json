[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHoneywell XL Web II Controller Vulnerabilities============================================== Last Revised February 02, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-033\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Maxim Rupp has identified vulnerabilities in Honeywell\u2019s XL Web II controller application. Honeywell has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following XL Web II controller versions are affected:* XL1000C500 XLWebExe\\-2\\-01\\-00 and prior, and* XLWeb 500 XLWebExe\\-1\\-02\\-08 and prior.IMPACT------ An attacker may use these vulnerabilities to expose a password by accessing a specific URL. The XL Web II controller application effectively becomes an entry point into the network where it is located. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Honeywell is a US\\-based company that maintains offices worldwide. The affected products, XL Web II controllers, are web\\-based SCADA systems. According to Honeywell, XL Web II controllers are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Honeywell estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe and the Middle East.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORDCWE\\-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256\\.html, web site last accessed February 02, 2017\\.

Users are encouraged to contact the local Honeywell HBS branch to have their sites updated to the latest version. In the Centraline partner channel, Excel Web controllers also have been sold under the brand name \u201cFALCON.\u201d Users can obtain the latest versions by contacting Centraline:<https://www.centraline.com/enGB/centraline/contact.html> ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
