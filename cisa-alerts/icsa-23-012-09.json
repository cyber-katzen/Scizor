For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix SAML\nVulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain sensitive information by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components from Siemens are affected:\n\nMendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible): Versions V2.3.0 and after up to V2.3.4\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, New Track): Versions V3.3.0 and after up to V3.3.9\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, Upgrade Track): Versions V3.3.0 and after up to V3.3.8\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected module is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.\nCVE-2022-46823 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Infrastructure\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, Upgrade Track): Update to V3.3.8 or later version.\nMendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, New Track): Update to V3.3.9 or later version.\nMendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible): Update to V2.3.4 or later version.\nEnable multi-factor authentication (MFA), if possible.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-496604 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\u00a0\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
