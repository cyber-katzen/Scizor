EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Weintek\nEquipment: cMT\nVulnerabilities: Code Injection, Improper Access Control, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access sensitive information and execute arbitrary code to gain root privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following models and OS versions of cMT are affected:\n\ncMT-SVR-1xx/2xx, versions prior to 20210305\ncMT-G01/G02, versions prior to 20210209\ncMT-G03/G04, versions prior to 20210222\ncMT3071/cMT3072/cMT3090/cMT3103/cMT3151, versions prior to 20210218\ncMT-HDM, versions prior to 20210204\ncMT-FHD, versions prior to 20210208\ncMT-CTRL01, versions prior to 20210302\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nThe Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to Code Injection, which may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the operation system.\nCVE-2021-27446 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to various improper access controls, which may allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely access and download sensitive information and perform administrative actions on behalf of a legitimate administrator.\nCVE-2021-27444 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.\nCVE-2021-27442 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMarcin Dudek from CERT.PL reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWeintek has released OS upgrades for the affected products. Refer to Weintek\u2019s Technical Notice regarding these vulnerabilities.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
