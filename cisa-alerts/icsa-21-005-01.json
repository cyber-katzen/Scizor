MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan to fix these vulnerabilities in current and future versions of Modicon PAC controllers. Schneider Electric will update [SEVD\\-2020\\-315\\-01](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-01/)  when the remediation is available. Until then, users should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:* Disable FTP via UnityPro / Ecostruxure Control Expert. This is disabled by default when a new application is created.* Configure the access control list via Ecostruxure Control Expert programming tool.* Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 21/TCP. Schneider Electric\u2019s Modicon Premium and Modicon Quantum controllers have reached their end of life and are no longer commercially available. They have been replaced by the Modicon M580 ePAC controller. For further information please refer to [Modicon Controllers Platform \\- CyberSecurity, Reference Manual](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001999/)  and [SEVD\\-2020\\-315\\-01](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-01/)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
