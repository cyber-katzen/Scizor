Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government. This malware variant has been identified as ARTFULPIE. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\n\t\t\tDHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.\n\n\t\t\tThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\n\n\t\t\tThis report looks at an implant that performs downloading and in-memory loading and execution of a DLL from a hardcoded url.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10271944-2.v1.stix.\nSubmitted Files (1)\n606c6000f36dc69fefc6df828e1ac9c5529a71a62b99f5df55463606c4c9689c (mega.exe.exe)\nIPs (1)\n193.56.28.103\n\nFindings\n\n606c6000f36dc69fefc6df828e1ac9c5529a71a62b99f5df55463606c4c9689c\nTags\ndownloadertrojan\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nmega.exe.exe\n\n\nSize\n83968 bytes\n\n\nType\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nMD5\n2d92116440edef4190279a043af6794b\n\n\nSHA1\neb2eb432445b3dcf6483e7d5f670acb94a8bab70\n\n\nSHA256\n606c6000f36dc69fefc6df828e1ac9c5529a71a62b99f5df55463606c4c9689c\n\n\nSHA512\nef849cb69d785bdcef98127abed65e0acc749f9748753d04105818e68ec5e37e068f8c4a7146b5238c5a6bf75712b198935c356b0fe0bb08eeef54ca7082d32f\n\n\nssdeep\n1536:FNtzOnGK/pmGC4ISgyCOkaPeFAuf+jXQ1JsWODjgncdw1DCaAqGgo:FNqpmGC7S1rJPQAFXKqDjgWwBCaAq3o\n\n\nEntropy\n6.334481\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nAvira\nHEUR/AGEN.1031247\n\n\nByteHero\nTrojan.Win32.Heur.098\n\n\nSymantec\nHeur.AdvML.B\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nPE Metadata\n\n\n\nCompile Date\n2019-06-14 05:41:48-04:00\n\n\nImport Hash\n8079a02c54cad285e36d60589737d1e3\n\n\n\nPE Sections\n\n\n\nMD5\nName\nRaw Size\nEntropy\n\n\n33371b670b629e6e418f34546c9b5eda\nheader\n1024\n2.672349\n\n\nd7c48cf554eae1f467a10903d05d84fc\n.text\n51712\n6.635530\n\n\n4b19a4f766cd6f95bd6b36fab052c916\n.rdata\n24064\n4.908608\n\n\n9ccfa1efb02e96faf15883c5d135e6f9\n.data\n2560\n1.986341\n\n\nc970c10a1e848ee974b87923ecbe6a2f\n.rsrc\n512\n4.706155\n\n\n51b1d3e64f81f0cc54f348474457a1d4\n.reloc\n4096\n6.403055\n\n\n\nPackers/Compilers/Cryptors\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ ?.?\n\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\n606c6000f3...\nConnected_To\n193.56.28.103\n\n\n\nDescription\nThe sample is a downloader/loader that performs the following steps:\n\n\t\t\tDownloads the hardcoded URL hxxp[:]//193[.]56[.]28[.]103:88/xampp/thinkmeter[.]dll into memory using the user-agent string: \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\".\n\n\t\t\tLoads the .dll into its own address space manually (fully in memory).\n\n\t\t\tCalls the .dll\u2019s entry-point.\n\n\n193.56.28.103\nTags\ncommand-and-control\nURLs\n\n193.56.28.103:88/xampp/thinkmeter.dll\n\nPorts\n\n88 TCP\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\n193.56.28.103\nConnected_From\n606c6000f36dc69fefc6df828e1ac9c5529a71a62b99f5df55463606c4c9689c\n\n\n\n\nRelationship Summary\n\n\n\n\n606c6000f3...\nConnected_To\n193.56.28.103\n\n\n193.56.28.103\nConnected_From\n606c6000f36dc69fefc6df828e1ac9c5529a71a62b99f5df55463606c4c9689c\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nNCCICCustomerService@us-cert.gov (UNCLASS)\nus-cert@dhs.sgov.gov (SIPRNET)\nus-cert@dhs.ic.gov (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
