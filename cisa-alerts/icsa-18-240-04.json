EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ABB\nEquipment: eSOMS\nVulnerability: Improper Authentication\n\n2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-18-240-04 ABB eSOMS that was published August 28, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to discover a valid user account, which could be used to gain access to the application without authentication.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of ABB eSOMS, an electronic shift operations management system, is affected:\n\neSOMS Version 6.0.2\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nUnauthorized access to the system can be achieved when LDAP is set to allow anonymous authentication, and specific key values within the eSOMS web.config file are present. Both conditions are required to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2018-14805 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Defense Industrial Base, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nABB reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nABB has released eSOMS version 6.0.3, which addresses this vulnerability. Please contact an ABB Global Customer Care Customer Advocate (customercare.es@abb.com) with any questions or for more information about the release.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nABB recommends the following immediate actions:\nUsers running eSOMS Version 6.0.2 should ensure \u201cUnauthenticated Authentication\u201d (anonymous bind) is disabled in the LDAP configuration settings. In the eSOMS web.config file, ensure only the following key values are populated: \u201cLDAP_Path,\u201d \u201cLDAP_User_Search,\u201d and \u201cLDAP_SSL_Enabled.\u201d The remaining LDAP related key values are reserved for non-standard LDAP server configurations and are not normally required.\nUsers should contact ABB global customer care (GCC) for further guidance if they experience issues with implementing LDAP authentication using only the previously mentioned key values.\nUsers can find more information in ABB\u2019s security advisory ABBVU-PGGA-2018030 at the following location:\nhttps://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107046A5821&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
