Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Treasury (Treasury) to highlight the cyber threat to cryptocurrency posed by North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and provide mitigation recommendations. Working with U.S. government partners, FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess that Lazarus Group\u2014which these agencies attribute to North Korean state\\-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors\u2014is targeting individuals and companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that have been modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency.       This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21\\-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of\u00a0North Korea's Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us\\-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21\\-048A.       There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018\\. In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third\\-party application from a website that appears legitimate.       The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version\u2014Ants2Whale\u2014and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations.       Ants2Whale, discovered in October 2020, is a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading software that is marketed and distributed by a company and website\u2014Ants2Whale and ants2whale\\[.]com, respectively\u2014that appear legitimate. Some information has been redacted from this report to preserve victim anonymity.     For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:  [MAR\\-10322463\\-7\\.v1\\.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10322463-7.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)   .

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
