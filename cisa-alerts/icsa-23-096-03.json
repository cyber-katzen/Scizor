EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0JTEKT ELECTRONICS CORPORATION\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Kostac PLC Programming Software\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Out-of-bounds Read, Use After Free\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disclose information or execute arbitrary code. \u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of JTEKT ELECTRONICS\u202fKostac PLC Programming Software are affected:\u00a0\n\nJTEKT ELECTRONICS Kostac PLC Programing Software: Versions 1.6.9.0 and earlier\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nWhen a specially crafted project file is opened, out-of-bounds read occurs when processing a comment block in stage information because the end of data cannot be verified.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22419\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nWhen a specially crafted project file is opened, out-of-bounds read occurs because buffer size used by the PLC program instructions is insufficient.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22421\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\u00a0\nWhen the maximum number of columns to place the PLC program is out of specification by opening a specially crafted project file, a process accesses memory that has already been freed.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22424\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing \u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide \u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan \u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to JPCERT/CC.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJTEKT ELECTRONICS recommends users to download the following updates:\u00a0\n\nVersion\u00a01.6.10.0\u00a0and above\u00a0\n\nThis version not only addresses the vulnerability, but also takes measures to prevent crafted project files from being opened. Project files saved with Version 1.6.9.0 or earlier can be re-saved with Version 1.6.10.0 or above to enable this tamper-proof feature. Project files saved with Version 1.6.10.0 or above cannot be opened with Version 1.6.9.0 or earlier.\u00a0\nFor more information, see JTEKT ELECTRONICS\u2019\u00a0Update Notice.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely. \u00a0\n",
