For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Mendix Forgot Password Module\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Observable Response Discrepancy\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 7 compatible): Versions prior to 3.7.1\u00a0\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 8 compatible): Version prior to 4.1.1\u00a0\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 9 compatible): Version prior to 5.1.1\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE-204\u00a0\nThe affected versions of the module contain an observable response discrepancy issue that could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-27464\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions:\u00a0\n\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 9 compatible): Update to\u00a0V5.1.1 or later version\u00a0\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 8 compatible): Update to\u00a0V4.1.1 or later version\u00a0\nMendix Forgot Password (Mendix 7 compatible): Update to\u00a0V3.7.1 or later version\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines\u00a0for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security web page.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-699404 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
