EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Johnson Controls, Inc.\nEquipment: Metasys\nVulnerability: Server-side Request Forgery\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to identify and forge requests to internal systems via a specially crafted request, allowing an attacker to determine whether specific files or paths exist.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Johnson Controls SCT and SCT Pro building automation software are affected:\n\nMetasys System Configuration Tool (SCT): All versions prior to 14.2.2\nMetasys System Configuration Tool Pro (SCT Pro): All versions prior to 14.2.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF) CWE-918\nThe affected product may allow an attacker to identify and forge requests to internal systems by way of a specially crafted request.\nCVE-2021-36203 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTony West and Scott Ponte reported this vulnerability to Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users take the following steps to mitigate this vulnerability:\n\nUpdate SCT/SCT Pro with Patch 14.2.2\nTake proper steps to minimize risks to all building automation systems.\n\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2022-03 v1\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
