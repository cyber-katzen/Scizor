EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: RUGGEDCOM APE1808\nVulnerabilities: SQL Injection, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components of Siemens are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808 with Nozomi Guardian / CMC: All versions before V22.6.3 or 23.1.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nA SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain parameters used in the Query functionality, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.\nCVE-2023-2567\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nA SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of Siemens IDS, may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the DBMS used by the web application by sending specially crafted malicious network packets. Malicious users with extensive knowledge on the underlying system may be able to extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way, or to alter its structure and data.\nCVE-2023-29245\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA denial of service (Dos) vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of Siemens IDS, allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the IDS module by sending specially crafted malformed network packets. During the (limited) time window before the IDS module is automatically restarted, network traffic may not be analyzed.\nCVE-2023-32649\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens is preparing updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Users are advised to consult and implement the workarounds provided in Nozomi Network's upstream security notifications. Contact user support to receive patch and update information.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nUse internal firewall features to limit access to the web management interface.\nIt is recommended to monitor the IDS log to check for abnormal stops and restarts.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-292063 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
