RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following components of Siemens are affected:* RUGGEDCOM APE1808 with Nozomi Guardian / CMC: All versions before V22\\.6\\.3 or 23\\.1\\.0### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)** A SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain parameters used in the Query functionality, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.[CVE\\-2023\\-2567](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2567)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)** A SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of Siemens IDS, may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the DBMS used by the web application by sending specially crafted malicious network packets. Malicious users with extensive knowledge on the underlying system may be able to extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way, or to alter its structure and data.[CVE\\-2023\\-29245](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29245)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** A denial of service (Dos) vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of Siemens IDS, allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the IDS module by sending specially crafted malformed network packets. During the (limited) time window before the IDS module is automatically restarted, network traffic may not be analyzed.[CVE\\-2023\\-32649](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-32649)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens is preparing updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Users are advised to consult and implement the workarounds provided in Nozomi Network's upstream security notifications. Contact user support to receive patch and update information. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Use internal firewall features to limit access to the web management interface.* It is recommended to monitor the IDS log to check for abnormal stops and restarts. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-292063 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-292063.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-292063.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
