EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 9\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\n* **Vendor:** \n Multiple (open source)\n* **Equipment:** \n uIP\\-Contiki\\-OS, uIP\\-Contiki\\-NG, uIP, open\\-iscsi, picoTCP\\-NG, picoTCP, FNET, Nut/Net\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Infinite Loop, Integer Wraparound, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, Integer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Improper Input Validation, Improper Null Termination\n\n\n\n CISA is aware of a public report, known as \u201cAMNESIA:33\u201d that details vulnerabilities found in multiple open\\-source TCP/IP stacks. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide early notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.\n \n\n\n\n The various open\\-source stacks may be implemented in forked repositories.\n \n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to corrupt memory, put devices into infinite loops, access unauthorized data, and/or poison DNS cache.\n \n\n\n3\\.

Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n* Use an internal DNS server that performs DNS\\-over\\-HTTPS for lookups.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-20-343-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2020-24336", "CVE-2020-24383", "CVE-2020-24335", "CVE-2020-17445", "CVE-2020-25110", "CVE-2020-17468", "CVE-2020-17444", "CVE-2020-24337", "CVE-2020-24341", "CVE-2020-13984", "CVE-2020-13987", "CVE-2020-24334", "CVE-2020-17469", "CVE-2020-25107", "CVE-2020-24339", "CVE-2020-17437", "CVE-2020-13986", "CVE-2020-17439", "CVE-2020-17441", "CVE-2020-25111", "CVE-2020-17470", "CVE-2020-17440", "CVE-2020-17467", "CVE-2020-13988", "CVE-2020-17443", "CVE-2020-17442", "CVE-2020-25109", "CVE-2020-25108", "CVE-2020-24340", "CVE-2020-24338", "CVE-2020-13985", "CVE-2020-25112", "CVE-2020-17438"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-20-343-01", "title": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "0f7b6f426f1b79d8f0347a37f8552738020202fe365356712ff64dd80d18945a"}
