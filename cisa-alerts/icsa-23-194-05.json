EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Rockwell Automation* **Equipment:**  PowerMonitor 1000* **Vulnerability:**  Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution and potentially the complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Rockwell Automation PowerMonitor 1000 are affected:* PowerMonitor 1000: V4\\.011### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)** The PowerMonitor 1000 contains stored cross site scripting vulnerabilities within the web page of the product. The vulnerable pages do not require privileges to access and can be injected with code by an attacker which could be used to leverage an attacker on an authenticated user resulting in remote code execution and potentially the complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.[CVE\\-2023\\-2072](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2072)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation has released the following mitigations and workarounds. Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigation below, if possible. Additionally, we encourage customers to implement our suggested security best practices to minimize the potential risk of the vulnerability.* Upgrade to [V4\\.019](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductCompareSelections.aspx?crumb=113&versions=58300,55146,54770)  which has been patched to mitigate these issues.* Rockwell Automation encourages users to implement their suggested [security best practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US#__highlight)  to minimize risk of the vulnerability. For more information, see Rockwell Automation\u2019s [Security Advisory](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1139761)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
