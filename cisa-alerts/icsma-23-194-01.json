MITIGATIONS\nBD has releaed BD Alaris System 12.3 with the following software, which remediates CVE-2018-1285, CVE 2023-30563, CVE 2023-30564, and CVE-2023-30565 and partially remediates CVE 2023-30562:\n\nBD Alaris Systems Manager Software version 12.5.1\nCalculation Services, version 1.1.1\n\nBD Alaris System 12.3 is no longer compatible with the CQI Reporter version 10.17 and earlier. Therefore CVE-2023-30565 no longer applies.\nBD Alaris System 12.3, which includes BD Alaris Guardrails Editor version 12.1.3, partially remediates CVE-2023-30562 and reduces the CVSS score from 6.7 (Medium) to 3.0 (Low). Additional information is provided under Vulnerability Details. For additional information is please reference the updated CVSS vector string provided: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\nBD recommends customers update to the BD Alaris System 12.3, where available based on regulatory authorization. Customers who require software updates should contact their BD Account Executive to assist with scheduling the remediation.\nBD also updated the BD Alaris PCU Model 8015 to version 12.3.1 when the BD Alaris System 12.3 was released. The following CVEs are still present on the BD Alaris PCU Model 8015 version 12.3.1: CVE-2023-30559, CVE-2023-30560, and CVE-2023-30561. This bulletin will be updated with additional remediation information when available.\nFor additional information, customers may request a copy of the latest BD Alaris System Product Security White Paper by visiting the\u00a0BD Cybersecurity Trust Center.\nTo reduce the risk associated with these vulnerabilities, BD recommends users implement the following mitigations and compensating controls:\nProvide appropriate network perimeter security, such as using firewalls, or create Access Control Lists (ACL) to limit network traffic from devices to only the required ports on the required endpoints.\n\nThe PCU only requires access to DNS, dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and SM on port 3613. The PCU does not accept unsolicited inbound traffic.\n\n\nBD recommends segmenting BD Alaris PCUs onto a separate virtual local area network (VLAN) to further enhance the security of BD Alaris PCUs.\n\nUsers should control network access to the SM server image by restricting external access to only those addresses and ports indicated in Chapter 1 of the SM Virtual Machine Deployment Guide.\n\nUsers should apply SSL certificates from valid Certificate Authorities, per Chapter 9 of the same document.\n\nFollow Chapter 1 of the Alaris System Maintenance Software User Manual to enable an authentication challenge password for network configuration changes.\nSee the Network Settings section of the Alaris System Maintenance User Manual for details on how to manage these credentials.\n\nNetwork Settings in the Alaris System Maintenance User Manual details managing these credentials.\nMonitor network traffic for unusual or unexpected traffic and activity. If users suspect credentials have been exposed, change credentials immediately.\n\nUtilize MAC filtering on the network segment containing the BD Alaris System to restrict access to only those approved devices needed.\nPeriodically inspect BD Alaris System components to ensure running the correct software versions.\n\nUse the instructions in Chapter 4 of the SM User Manual or Section 6.2.10 of the BD Alaris PCU and Pump Module Technical Service Manual to find software versions.\n\nAdhere to industry security best practices regarding access control, identification and authorization, personnel security, and physical protection of assets, as recommended by NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2.\nInspect the BD Alaris System prior to use for signs of tampering as indicated in the FIPS 140-2 Compliance Instructions for BD Alaris System Products Service Manual.\nFor more information, refer to BD's\u00a0security bulletin.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
