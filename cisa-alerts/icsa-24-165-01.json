EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix Applications\nVulnerability: Improper Privilege Management\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation requires to guess the identification of a target role which contains the elevated access rights.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products, are affected:\n\nSiemens Mendix Applications using Mendix 9: Versions prior to V9.24.22 and after V9.3.0\nSiemens Mendix Applications using Mendix 10: Versions prior to V10.11.0\nSiemens Mendix Applications using Mendix 10 (V10.6): Versions prior V10.6.9\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nAffected applications could allow users with the capability to manage a role to elevate the access rights of users with that role. Successful exploitation requires to guess the id of a target role which contains the elevated access rights.\nCVE-2024-33500 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-33500. A base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, Financial Services, Government Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAchmea Security Assessment Team reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update the product to following versions:\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: Update to V9.24.22 or later version\nMendix Applications using Mendix 10: Update to V10.11.0 or later version\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 10 (V10.6): Update to V10.6.9 or later version\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSet the runtime setting StrictReferenceChecks to false; note however, that this comes at the price of making the reference checks less secure\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-540640 in HTML and CSAF.CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJune 13, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
