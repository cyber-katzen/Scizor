EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: License Management Utility\nVulnerability: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow local users to escalate privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of License Management Utility (LMU), a license management system, are affected:\n\nLMU: All versions prior to v2.4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXECUTION WITH UNNECESSARY PRIVILEGES CWE-250\nA specific service of the affected application is executed with local SYSTEM privileges on the server while its configuration can be modified by local users.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-10056 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities Sector, Government Facilities Sector\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nBundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an updated version (v2.4) of LMU, and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nApply security hardening of the Windows Server, where LMU is installed on, in accordance with corporate security policies or up-to-date hardening guidelines.\nEnsure only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional local accounts on the server.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nFor more information please see Siemens Advisory: SSA-709003\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
