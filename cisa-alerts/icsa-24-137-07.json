TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following versions of SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager, a configuration, operation, and maintenance tool, are affected:\n \n\n\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-0DA00\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-0DA10\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-0DA20\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-0DA30\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-1EA10\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-1EA20\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n* Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780\\-1EA30\\): Versions prior to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\\_64 processors supporting the AVX512\\-IFMA instructions. If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non\\-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\\_64 processors supporting the AVX512\\-IFMA instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various \\- from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non\\-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20\\-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1\\.2 and 1\\.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. As a workaround the AVX512\\-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\\_ia32cap: OPENSSL\\_ia32cap\\=:\\~0x200000\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-4807](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-4807) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.2** \n[**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialization vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialization of some symmetric ciphers. A truncation in the IV can result in non\\-uniqueness, which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling EVP\\_EncryptInit\\_ex2(), EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex2() or EVP\\_CipherInit\\_ex2() the provided OSSL\\_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length, via the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter, within the OSSL\\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP 800\\-38D section 8\\.2\\.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore, it is likely that application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly vulnerable. OpenSSL 3\\.1 and 3\\.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-5363](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-5363) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.3** \n[**IMPROPER CHECK FOR UNUSUAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE\\-754**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)\n\n\n\n Generating excessively long X9\\.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9\\.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Applications that use the functions DH\\_generate\\_key() to generate an X9\\.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key(), DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_public\\_check() to check an X9\\.42 DH key or X9\\.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. While DH\\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE\\-2023\\-3817\\), DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() doesn't make any of these checks and is vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH\\_generate\\_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls DH\\_generate\\_key() or DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial\\-of\\-service attack. DH\\_generate\\_key() and DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_pub\\_key\\_ex(), EVP\\_PKEY\\_public\\_check(), and EVP\\_PKEY\\_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the \"\\-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-5678](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-5678) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.4** \n[**UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)\n\n\n\n Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to \\<\\= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-29409](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-29409) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.5** \n[**EXCESSIVE ITERATION CWE\\-834**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/834.html)\n\n\n\n PC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases. Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks: \\- Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser \\- Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser. The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per\\-input\\-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with a parsing loop, with n selected by the client. The unbounded memory buffering bugs: \\- The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. \\- HPACK variants have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0's can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC's hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse. \\- gRPC's metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-33953](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33953) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.6** \n[**ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)\n\n\n\n When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API. However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-38039](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38039) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.7** \n[**HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)\n\n\n\n This flaw makes curl overflow a heap\\-based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes. If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-38545](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38545) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.8** \n[**EXTERNAL CONTROL OF FILE NAME OR PATH CWE\\-73**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html)\n\n\n\n This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met. libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates \"easy handles\" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl provides a function call that duplicates an easy handle called curl\\_easy\\_duphandle. If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the cookie\\-enable state is also cloned \\- but without cloning the actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as\n `none` \n (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes). Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named\n `none` \n \\- if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the program using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-38546](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-38546) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.9** \n[**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set \"super cookies\" in curl that are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL).

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens recommends updating affected products to V3\\.0\\.1\\.1 or later version. Update is available from Siemens Online Software Delivery (OSD).\n \n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* Install required RTLS Locating Manager components on a single host computer where possible and ensure only trusted persons have access to the system\n* Secure the Windows Server, where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed on, with a firewall and make sure no ports are accessible from untrusted networks\n* Apply security hardening of the Windows Server, where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed on, in accordance with your corporate security policies or up\\-to\\-date hardening guidelines\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n\n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-093430 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-093430.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-093430.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
