[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryLOYTEC LVIS\\-3ME================ Last Revised September 14, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-257\\-01### **CVSS v3 8\\.1****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  LOYTEC**Equipment:**  LVIS\\-3ME**Vulnerabilities:**  Relative Path Traversal, Insufficient Entropy, Cross\\-site Scripting, Insufficiently Protected CredentialsAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of LVIS\\-3ME, an HMI Touch Panel, are affected:* LVIS\\-3ME versions prior to 6\\.2\\.0IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in information exposure or allow arbitrary code execution.MITIGATION---------- LOYTEC has released a firmware update, V6\\.2\\.0, to address these vulnerabilities. LOYTEC recommends that users update to the latest firmware update which is available by accessing an account at the following location:<https://www.loytec.com/support/download/> NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: 1\\.Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages. 2\\.Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams. 3\\.Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable. Low skill level is needed to exploit.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE\\-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The web user interface fails to prevent access to critical files that non administrative users should not have access to, which could allow an attacker to create or modify files or execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2017\\-13996](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-13996)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
