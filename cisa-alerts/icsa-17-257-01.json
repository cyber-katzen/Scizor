LOYTEC recommends that users update to the latest firmware update which is available by accessing an account at the following location:\nhttps://www.loytec.com/support/download/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n1.Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n2.Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scamsfor more information on avoiding email scams.\n3.Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacksfor more information on social engineering attacks.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable. Low skill level is needed to exploit.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nRELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\n\nThe web user interface fails to prevent access to critical files that non administrative users should not have access to, which could allow an attacker to create or modify files or execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2017-13996 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n\nINSUFFICIENT ENTROPY CWE-331\n\nThe application does not utilize sufficiently random number generation for the web interface authentication mechanism, which could allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2017-13992 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\n\nThe web interface lacks proper web request validation, which could allow XSS attacks to occur if an authenticated user of the web interface is tricked into clicking a malicious link.\nCVE-2017-13994 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n\nINSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\n\nThe application does not sufficiently protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.\nCVE-2017-13998 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nDavy Douhine of RandoriSec reported the vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Austria\n",
