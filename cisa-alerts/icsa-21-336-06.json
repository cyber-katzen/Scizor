MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends users update to Transformer APM Edge v4\\.0\\. This version updates the software components to remediate this vulnerability. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Do not directly connect to the Internet.* Separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Please see Hitachi Energy advisory [8DBD000057](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000057&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  for additional mitigation and update information. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  .
