For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\nEquipment:\u00a0Third-party components libexpat and libcurl in SINEC NMS\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Expected Behavior Violation, Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Use After Free, Double Free, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impact SINEC NMS confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products are affected:\n\nThird-Party components used in SINEC NMS: All versions prior to V1.0.3.1\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0EXPECTED BEHAVIOR VIOLATION CWE-440\nWhen doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send\u2014even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set\u2014if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32221 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER VALIDATION OF SYNTACTIC CORRECTNESS OF INPUT CWE-1286\u00a0\nWhen curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, it accepts cookies using control codes that, when later sent back to a HTTP server, might cause the server to return 400 responses, effectively allowing a \"sister site\" to deny service to all \u201csiblings.\u201d\u00a0\nCVE-2022-35252 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nCurl could be directed to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl would first read past the end of the stack-based buffer and, if the read works, write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This could\u00a0 cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes. If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, then this flaw could be used to cause denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-35260 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nLibexpat before 2.4.9 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40674 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nCurl can be asked to tunnel almost all protocols it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can (and often do) deny such tunnel operations using an appropriate HTTP error response code. When denied to tunnel the specific protocols SMB or TELNET, curl could use a heap-allocated struct after freed in its transfer shutdown code path.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43552 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nIn libexpat through 2.4.9, there is a use after free vulnerability caused by overeager destruction of a shared DTD in XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate in out-of-memory situations.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43680 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0DOUBLE FREE CWE-415\nCurl before 7.86.0 has a double free vulnerability. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, such as 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-42915 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.8\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nIn curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed by tricking it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.). The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-42916 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.9\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\u00a0\nA vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed by tricking it into using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, such as using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E). Then, in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the information IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43551 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4.
