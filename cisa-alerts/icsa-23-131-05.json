EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Third\\-party components libexpat and libcurl in SINEC NMS* **Vulnerabilities:**  Expected Behavior Violation, Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Use After Free, Double Free, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impact SINEC NMS confidentiality, integrity, and availability.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products are affected:* Third\\-Party components used in SINEC NMS: All versions prior to V1\\.0\\.3\\.1### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [EXPECTED BEHAVIOR VIOLATION CWE\\-440](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/440.html)** When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (\\`CURLOPT\\_READFUNCTION\\`) to ask for data to send\u2014even when the \\`CURLOPT\\_POSTFIELDS\\` option has been set\u2014if the same handle previously was used to issue a \\`PUT\\` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent \\`POST\\` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.[CVE\\-2022\\-32221](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32221)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER VALIDATION OF SYNTACTIC CORRECTNESS OF INPUT CWE\\-1286](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1286.html)** When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, it accepts cookies using control codes that, when later sent back to a HTTP server, might cause the server to return 400 responses, effectively allowing a \"sister site\" to deny service to all \u201csiblings.\u201d[CVE\\-2022\\-35252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35252)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** Curl could be directed to parse a \\`.netrc\\` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with 4095 consecutive non\\-white space letters and no newline, curl would first read past the end of the stack\\-based buffer and, if the read works, write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This could\u00a0 cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes. If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, then this flaw could be used to cause denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-35260](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35260)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Libexpat before 2\\.4\\.9 has a use\\-after\\-free vulnerability in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.[CVE\\-2022\\-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Curl can be asked to tunnel almost all protocols it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can (and often do) deny such tunnel operations using an appropriate HTTP error response code. When denied to tunnel the specific protocols SMB or TELNET, curl could use a heap\\-allocated struct after freed in its transfer shutdown code path.[CVE\\-2022\\-43552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43552)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** In libexpat through 2\\.4\\.9, there is a use after free vulnerability caused by overeager destruction of a shared DTD in XML\\_ExternalEntityParserCreate in out\\-of\\-memory situations.[CVE\\-2022\\-43680](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43680)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.7 [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)** Curl before 7\\.86\\.0 has a double free vulnerability. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non\\-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, such as 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non\\-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7\\.77\\.0\\.[CVE\\-2022\\-42915](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42915)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.8 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** In curl before 7\\.86\\.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed by tricking it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF\\-8 U\\+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U\\+002E (.). The earliest affected version is 7\\.77\\.0 2021\\-05\\-26\\.[CVE\\-2022\\-42916](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42916)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.9 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** A vulnerability exists in curl \\<7\\.87\\.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed by tricking it into using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear\\-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, such as using the character UTF\\-8 U\\+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U\\+002E). Then, in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the information IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.[CVE\\-2022\\-43551](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43551)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\.
