For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens \u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0SCALANCE W1750D\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Inadequate Encryption Strength, Double Free, Use After Free, Improper Input Validation\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read memory contents, decrypt RSA-encrypted messages, or create a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE W1750D (JP) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AD0): All versions \u00a0\nSCALANCE W1750D (ROW) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AA0): All versions\u00a0\nSCALANCE W1750D (USA) (6GK5750-2HX01-1AB0): All versions \u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\u00a0\nA timing-based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP, and RSASVE. After a sufficiently large number of messages, the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-4304\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0DOUBLE FREE CWE-415\u00a0\nIt is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case, PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who can supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-4450\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\u00a0\nUnder certain conditions, if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO, a use after free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0215\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\u00a0\nA type confusion vulnerability could allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0286\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nCVE-2023-0286: Disable CRL (certification revocation list) checking, if possible.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-4450: Do not import or configure certificate files in PEM format from untrusted sources.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-4304: Disable the use of RSA ciphers in the web server configuration; note that RSA ciphers are disabled by default.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines\u00a0for Industrial Security. Additional information on Siemens Industrial Security can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-203374 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
