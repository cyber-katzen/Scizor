See the [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/enterprise/)  for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.*** This joint cybersecurity advisory is the result of an analytic effort among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to highlight ongoing malicious cyber activity by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC assess is associated with the government of Iran. FBI and CISA have observed this Iranian government\\-sponsored APT group exploit Fortinet vulnerabilities since at least March 2021 and a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability since at least October 2021 to gain initial access to systems in advance of follow\\-on operations, which include deploying ransomware. ACSC is also aware this APT group has used the same Microsoft Exchange vulnerability in Australia. The Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors are actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector and the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, as well as Australian organizations. FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC assess the actors are focused on exploiting known vulnerabilities rather than targeting specific sectors. These Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors can leverage this access for follow\\-on operations, such as data exfiltration or encryption, ransomware, and extortion. This advisory provides observed tactics and techniques, as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs) that FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC assess are likely associated with this Iranian government\\-sponsored APT activity. The FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from Iranian government\\-sponsored cyber actors. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see [AA21\\-321A.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-321A.stix.xml)  .

Observed activity includes the following.* In March 2021, the FBI and CISA observed these Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors scanning devices on ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for Fortinet FortiOS vulnerability [CVE\\-2018\\-13379](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379)  , and enumerating devices for FortiOS vulnerabilities [CVE\\-2020\\-12812](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12812)  and [CVE\\-2019\\-5591](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5591)  . The Iranian Government\\-sponsored APT actors likely exploited these vulnerabilities to gain access to vulnerable networks. **Note:**  for previous FBI and CISA reporting on this activity, refer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: [APT Actors Exploit Vulnerabilities to Gain Initial Access for Future Attacks](https://www.ic3.gov/media/news/2021/210402.pdf)  .* In May 2021, these Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors exploited a Fortigate appliance to access a webserver hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal government. The actors likely created an account with the username `elie`  to further enable malicious activity. **Note:**  for previous FBI reporting on this activity, refer to [FBI FLASH: APT Actors Exploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities to Gain Initial Access for Malicious Activity](https://www.ic3.gov/media/news/2021/210527.pdf)  .* In June 2021, these APT actors exploited a Fortigate appliance to access environmental control networks associated with a U.S.\\-based hospital specializing in healthcare for children. The Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors likely leveraged a server assigned to IP addresses `91.214.124[.]143`  and `162.55.137[.]20`  \u2014which FBI and CISA judge are associated with Iranian government cyber activity\u2014to further enable malicious activity against the hospital\u2019s network. The APT actors accessed known user accounts at the hospital from IP address `154.16.192[.]70`  , which FBI and CISA judge is associated with government of Iran offensive cyber activity.* As of October 2021, these APT actors have leveraged a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability\u2014 `CVE-2021-34473`  \u2014to gain initial access to systems in advance of follow\\-on operations. ACSC considers that this APT group has also used the same Microsoft Exchange vulnerability ( [CVE\\-2021\\-34473](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473)  ) in Australia.### MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques FBI, CISA, ACSC, and NCSC assess the following tactics and techniques are associated with this activity.#### Resource Development \\[ [TA0042](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0042)  ] The APT actors have used the following malicious and legitimate tools \\[ [T1588\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1588/001)  , [T1588\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1588/002)  ] for a variety of tactics across the enterprise spectrum.* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)  for credential theft \\[ [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0042)  ]* WinPEAS for privilege escalation \\[ [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0004)  ]* SharpWMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)* WinRAR for archiving collected data \\[ [TA0009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0009)  , [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1560/001)  ]* FileZilla for transferring files \\[ [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0010)  ]#### Initial Access \\[ [TA0001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0001/)  ] The Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange servers (CVE\\-2021\\-34473\\) and Fortinet devices (CVE\\-2018\\-13379, CVE\\-2020\\-12812, and CVE\\-2019\\-5591\\) \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1190/)  ].#### Execution \\[ [TA0002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0002)  ] The Iranian government\\-sponsored APT actors may have made modifications to the Task Scheduler \\[ [T1053\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1053/005)  ].
