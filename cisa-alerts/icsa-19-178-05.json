EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: WebAccess/SCADA\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Read, Out-of-bounds Write, Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow information disclosure, deletion of files, and remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of WebAccess/SCADA, a SCADA software platform, are affected:\n\nWebAccess/SCADA Versions 8.3.5 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nA path traversal vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to use in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete files while posing as an administrator.\nCVE-2019-10985 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-10991 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-10989 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow disclosure of information.\nCVE-2019-10983 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nMultiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-10987 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\nMultiple untrusted pointer dereference vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-10993 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: East Asia, United States, Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell, Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) and EljahLG, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech has released Version 8.4.1 of WebAccess/SCADA to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccess/SCADA at the following location (registration required):\nhttps://support.advantech.com/support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-MS9MJV&Doc_Source=Download\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
