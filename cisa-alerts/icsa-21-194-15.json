RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution on the target host system.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following Siemens products are affected:\n \n\n\n* JT2Go: All versions prior to v13\\.2\n* Teamcenter Visualization: All versions prior to v13\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.1\n [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)\n\n\n\n The BMP\\_Loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing BMP files. A malformed input file could result in a double free of an allocated buffer that leads to a crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause denial\\-of\\-service condition.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-34333](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34333) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0(\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.2\n [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE\\-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)\n\n\n\n The BMP\\_Loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing BMP files. A malformed input file could result in an infinite loop condition that leads to a denial\\-of\\-service condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to consume excessive resources.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-34332](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34332) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-34331](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34331) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The plmxmlAdapterSE70\\.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the fixed\\-length heap\\-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-34329](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34329) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
