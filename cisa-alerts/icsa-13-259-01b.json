Emerson Process Management estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITYCWE\\-912: Hidden Functionality, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/912\\.html, web site last accessed September 26, 2013\\. In the case of the ROC800 RTU, there are three separate hidden functionality vulnerabilities that are described below. Each of these hidden capabilities increases the attack surface for the device and can be exploited by an attacker.### OSE DEBUG BROADCAST The ROC800 RTU runs the ENEA OSE operating system. The kernel running on the ROC800 device broadcasts a network beacon allowing easier detection of the OSE Debug vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. CVE\\-2013\\-0693NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-0693, web site last accessed November 04, 2014\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed September 26, 2013\\.### **OSE DEBUG SERVICE** The ROC800 RTU kernel has a port available for attaching a debug tool. A device with a running debug service allows debuggers to attach and remotely debug code on the device and is intended to be enabled, only on development systems and never on a production device. An attacker can remotely attach to the device and alter memory, registers, process states, and ultimately have full control of the device. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. CVE\\-2013\\-0692NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-0692, web site last accessed November 04, 2014\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

At this time, Emerson recommends that concerned asset owners install the EDR 810 between the host and the field device to mitigate this vulnerability. The EDR\\-810 is a secure router with firewall capabilities. The compatibility of the EDR\\-810 with the ROC800 platform has been tested and verified by Emerson Remote Automation Solutions. Emerson has determined that the EDR\\-810 is suitable for field installation. The EDR\u2011810 uses IPSec for encryption and authentication of all IP packets at the network layer to ensure confidentiality and sender authentication. Additional information about the Moxa EDR\\-810 secure router is available at the following location:[http://www.moxa.com/product/EDR\\-810\\.htm](http://www.moxa.com/product/EDR-810.htm) ### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
