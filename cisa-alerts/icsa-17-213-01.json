E\\-Designer=========================================== Last Revised August 01, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-213\\-01### **CVSS v3 9\\.8****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V.**Equipment:**  E\\-Designer**Vulnerabilities:**  Heap\\-Based Buffer Overflow, Stack\\-Based Buffer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-Bounds WriteAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following version of E\\-Designer, a Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. product to program HMIs for E1000 products, is affected:* E\\-Designer, Version 7\\.52 Build 344\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can result in corruption of sensitive information, system crash, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.MITIGATION---------- Mitsubishi recommends the following actions to mitigate these vulnerabilities:* Use E\\-Designer in a safe, firewalled network.* Replace E\\-Designer HMIs with interfaces built with Mitsubishi\u2019s new product, GT Works. E\\-Designer has been discontinued. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Six code sections have been identified in which exploiting this vulnerability can overwrite the stack. This can result in arbitrary code execution, compromised data integrity, denial of service, and system crash.[CVE\\-2017\\-9638](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9638)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).[HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Five code sections have been identified in which exploiting this vulnerability can overwrite the heap. This can result in arbitrary code execution, compromised data integrity, denial of service, and system crash.[CVE\\-2017\\-9636](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9636)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
