A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND \u2022 **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems \u2022 **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide \u2022 **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER WATERSURE and KIANDRA IT reported this vulnerability to Siemens.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- If the affected products are installed under their default path (\u201cC:\\\\Program Files\\\\\\*\u201d or the localized equivalent) and the default file system access permissions for drive C:\\\\ were not modified, the security vulnerability is not exploitable. However, if the affected products are not installed under their default path (\u201cC:\\\\Program Files\\\\\\*\u201d or the localized equivalent), the security vulnerability is potentially exploitable.
