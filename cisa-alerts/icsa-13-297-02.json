The vulnerability report was part of a resolution by Catapult Software, which developed the driver for the GE products.\nAdam Crain of Automatak and independent researcher Chris Sistrunk originally reported the improper input validation vulnerability in the Catapult Software driver to NCCIC/ICS-CERT in the advisory ICSA-13-297-01 Catapult Software DNP3 Driver Improper Input Validation.\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\u00a0\nThe following GE Intelligent Platforms are affected:\n\nProficy human-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) DNP3 I/O Driver (\u201cDNP\u201d): Version 7.20j (Catapult v7.2.0.56) and prior versions.\nProficy HMI/SCADA\u2014iFIX or CIMPLICITY servers with the vulnerable I/O Driver installed (this includes iFIX or CIMPLICITY installations that are part of Proficy Process Systems).\n\nIMPACT\nThe master station can be put into a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted transmission control protocol (TCP) packet from the outstation on an IP-based network. If the device is connected via a serial connection, the same attack can be accomplished with physical access to the outstation. The device must be shut down and restarted to recover from the DoS.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGE is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected DNP3 driver products can be used in conjunction with Proficy, iFIX, and CIMPLICITY HMI/SCADA software. According to GE Proficy, iFIX and CIMPLICITY are deployed across several sectors including oil and gas, water and wastewater, and electric utilities.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nAs this vulnerability affects Internet Protocol-connected and Serial-connected devices, two CVSS scores have been calculated.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION-IP-BASEDCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013.\n\nThe Catapult Software DNP3 driver, used in the GE iFIX and CIMPLICITY products, does not validate input correctly. An attacker could cause the software to go into an infinite loop by sending a specifically crafted TCP packet, causing the process to crash.\nCVE-2013-2811NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2811, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION-SERIAL-BASEDCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013.\n\nThe Catapult Software DNP3 driver, used in the GE iFIX and CIMPLICITY products, does not validate input correctly. An attacker could cause the software to go into an infinite loop, causing the process to crash. The system must be restarted manually to clear the condition.\nThe following scoring is for serial-connected devices.\nCVE-2013-2823NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2823, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE has provided the following mitigations:\n\nInstalling Version 7.20k (Catapult v7.2.0.60) of the DNP driver or newer will address this issue. To obtain the latest version of any I/O driver, visit GE\u2019s Web site at http://support.ge-ip.com and in the right column look for \u201cQuick Picks\u201d > \u201cDownloads\u201d > \u201cI/O Drivers.\u201d\nDNP Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 v7.xx I/O Driver: http://support.ge-ip.com/support/index?page=dwchannel&comp=iodetail&id=DG309\n\nFor the GE Security Advisory on this issue:\nhttp://support.ge-ip.com/support/index?page=kbchannel&id=KB15805\nIn addition, the driver update is also available from Catapult Software at http://catapultsoftware.com/support\nThe researchers suggest blocking DNP3 traffic from traversing onto business or corporate networks through the use of an IPS or firewall with DNP3-specific rule sets to add an additional layer of protection.\nNCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\u2011in\u2011Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013. NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies,Target Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed November 19, 2013. that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
