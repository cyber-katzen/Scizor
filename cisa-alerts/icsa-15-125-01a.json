ICS-CERT is reporting on these additional vulnerabilities identified by \u201ctech\u201d to provide notice, so that asset owners and operators can take additional defensive measures to mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities.\nHospira has developed a new version of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System and has stated that this new version will mitigate these vulnerabilities. Hospira has submitted a premarket 510(k) submission of the new LifeCare PCA Infusion System to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and this submission is currently under review. The release of the new system will be dependent on the clearance of Hospira\u2019s 510(k).\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target some of these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 4 ----------\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Hospira products are affected:\n\nLifeCare PCA Infusion System, Version 5.0 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nExploitation of the improper authorization vulnerability may allow unauthenticated users to access the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump with root privileges by default. Exploitation of the insufficient verification of data authenticity vulnerability may allow an attacker to remotely push unauthorized modifications to the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump impacting medication libraries and pump configuration.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 --------\nSuccessful exploitation of newly identified hardcoded passwords, insecurely stored credentials, and vulnerable software version vulnerabilities can impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 4 ----------\nWhile drug libraries, software updates, and pump configurations can be modified, according to Hospira, it is not possible to remotely operate the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump. Operation of the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump requires a clinician to be present at the pump to manually program the pump with a specified dosage before medication can be administered.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nHospira is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected product, the LifeCare PCA Infusion System, is an intravenous pump that delivers medication to patients. The affected products are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health Sector. Hospira estimates that these products are primarily used in the US and Canada.\nVUNLNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER AUTHORIZATIONCWE-285: Improper Authorization, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html, web site last accessed May 13, 2015.\n\nThe LifeCare PCA Infusion pump\u2019s communication module gives unauthenticated users root privileges on Port 23/TELNET by default.

This vulnerability impacts LifeCare PCA Infusion Systems Version 5, prior to Version 5.07. According to Hospira, Version 3 of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System does not have wireless capability and, therefore, does not use the vulnerable versions of AppWeb.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target some of these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit four of these vulnerabilities; the other vulnerability would require high skill to exploit.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 4 ----------\nMITIGATION\nICS-CERT has been working with Hospira since May 2014 to address the vulnerabilities in the LifeCare PCA Infusion System. Hospira has developed a new version of the PCS Infusion System, Version 7.0 that addresses the identified vulnerabilities. According to Hospira, Version\u00a07.0 has Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET closed by default to prevent unauthorized access.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 --------\nHospira has developed a new version of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System and has stated that this new version will mitigate these vulnerabilities. Specifically, the new version is intended to:\n\nMitigate unauthorized remote access to the device,\nDisable the ability for unauthorized changes to the medication library,\nRemove hard-coded passwords to gain access to the device,\nEncrypt storage of wireless network keys, and\nEnsure that the vulnerable versions of AppWeb are no longer used.\n\nExisting PCA Infusion Systems running Version 5.0 can be upgraded to Version 7.0 when it becomes available. Hospira will be retiring older versions of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System, Versions 2 and Versions 3, by the end of the year, 2015.\nHospira\u2019s premarket 510(k) submission for the new LifeCare PCA Infusion System (Version\u00a07.0) is currently being reviewed by the FDA. The release of the new system will be dependent on the clearance of Hospira\u2019s 510(k).\nFor additional information about Hospira\u2019s upcoming release, contact Hospira\u2019s technical support at 1-800-241-4002.\nICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners to perform a risk assessment by examining their specific clinical use of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System in their host environment to identify any potential impacts of the identified vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT offers the following compensating options:\n\nTemporarily disconnect the affected LifeCare PCA Infusion System from the wireless network until unused ports on the device are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET. Once the unused ports have been closed, reconnecting the affected device to the wireless network should be done after ensuring that the host network is isolated from the Internet. The affected LifeCare PCA Infusion Systems should be isolated from untrusted systems; traffic to the device should be selectively controlled and monitored for anomalous activity.\nDisconnect the affected LifeCare PCA Infusion System from the wireless network and use a wired connection to the host network. The operational concerns associated with this option are primarily associated with the initial setup of the wired connection and verifying that the host network effectively implements good design practices prior to connection of the LifeCare PCA Infusion System.\nIf neither of the previous two options are feasible, then disconnect the affected LifeCare PCA Infusion System from the wireless network until mitigations are available. Disconnecting the affected device from the wireless network will have operational impacts. Disconnecting the device will require drug libraries to be updated manually and data normally transmitted to MedNet from the device, will not be available. Manual updates to each pump can be labor intensive and prone to entry error.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to implement the following defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure that unused ports are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET. \nMaintain layered physical and logical security to implement defense-in-depth security practices for environments operating medical devices.\nIsolate the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump from the Internet and untrusted systems.\nProduce an MD5 checksum of key files to identify any unauthorized changes.\nUse good design practices that include network segmentation. Use DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems to identify anomalous activity. Use the static nature of these isolated environments to look for anomalous activities.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 4 of 4 ----------\nICS-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
