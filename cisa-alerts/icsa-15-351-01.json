[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric Modicon M340 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability============================================================= Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-351\\-01OVERVIEW-------- David Atch of CyberX has identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in Schneider Electric\u2019s Modicon M340 PLC product line. Schneider Electric has produced a new firmware patch to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Schneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following Modicon M340 PLC products:* BMXNOC0401,* BMXNOE0100,* BMXNOE0100H,* BMXNOE0110,* BMXNOE0110H,* BMXNOR0200,* BMXNOR0200H,* BMXP342020,* BMXP342020H,* BMXP342030,* BMXP3420302,* BMXP3420302H, and* BMXPRA0100\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the device that the attacker is accessing to crash; a buffer overflow condition may allow remote code execution. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Schneider Electric is a Europe\\-based company that maintains offices in 190 countries worldwide. The affected products, Modicon M340, are PLC devices. According to Schneider Electric, Modicon PLCs are deployed across several sectors including Defense Industrial Base; Energy; Government Facilities; Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste; Transportation Systems; Water and Wastewater Systems; and others. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States, China, Russia, and India.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-121:Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, web site last accessed December 17, 2015\\.

Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
