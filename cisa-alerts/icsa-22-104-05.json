If a TLSv1\\.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\\_algorithms extension, where it was present in the initial ClientHello, but includes a signature\\_algorithms\\_cert extension, then a NULL pointer dereference will occur, leading to a crash and a denial\\-of\\-service condition. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1\\.2 and renegotiation enabled, which is the default configuration. OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1\\.1\\.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1\\.1\\.1k. OpenSSL 1\\.0\\.2 is not impacted by this issue. This vulnerability is fixed in OpenSSL 1\\.1\\.1k.[CVE\\-2021\\-3449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3449)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated. the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  )### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions available. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Please see Siemens [SSA\\-772220](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/txt/ssa-772220.txt)  to determine if there is an update available. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please [contact Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  .

Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
