EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\u00a0\nEquipment: Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR\nVulnerability: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow remote code execution, cause the application to crash, or cause a denial-of-service condition in the application server.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR, a communication management software, and accompanying PLC simulators are affected:\n\nCOMMGR Version 1.08 and prior.\n\nDVPSimulator EH2, EH3, ES2, SE, SS2\nAHSIM_5x0, AHSIM_5x1\n\n\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe application utilizes a fixed-length stack buffer where an unverified length value can be read from the network packets via a specific network port, causing the buffer to be overwritten. This may allow remote code execution, cause the application to crash, or result in a denial-of-service condition in the application server.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-10594 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAn anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics has released COMMGR v1.09 to address this vulnerability and recommends users upgrade. The updated version can be downloaded at:\nhttp://www.deltaww.com/Products/PluginWebUserControl/downloadCenterCounter.aspx?DID=2093&DocPath=1&hl=en-USl\nDelta Electronics also recommends affected users apply application whitelists to allow only trusted communications via Ports 502 and 10002.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
