EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Ricon Mobile, Inc.\nEquipment: Industrial Cellular Router\nVulnerability: OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as an Admin user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Ricon Industrial Cellular Router, a mobile network router, are affected:\n\nS9922XL Version 16.10.3\nS9922L Version 16.10.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection, which may allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the Admin (root) user.\nCVE-2022-0365 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nGjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRicon Mobile has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate this vulnerability. Users of the affected products are invited to contact Ricon Mobile customer support for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
