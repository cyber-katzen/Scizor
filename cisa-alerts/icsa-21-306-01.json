EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Sensormatic Electronics, LLC, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc.\nEquipment: VideoEdge\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the execution of untrusted code when viewing the VideoEdge admin graphical user interface.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of VideoEdge, a network video recorder, are affected:\n\nVideoEdge: All versions prior to v5.7.1\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA vulnerability in the JQuery web user interface (UI) component could allow a webpage to be altered before it is served to users.\nCVE-2020-11023 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc. reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls has identified the following specific mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUpgrade VideoEdge to Version 5.7.1\n\nFor more detailed mitigation and product upgrade instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2021-17 v1\nFurther ICS security notices and product security guidance are located at the Johnson Controls product security website.\nUsers with additional questions may contact Johnson Controls Global Product Security.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
