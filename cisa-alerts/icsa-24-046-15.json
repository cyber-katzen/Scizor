RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a information dislosure, authentication bypass, unauthorized modification, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports that the following network management systems are affected:* SINEC NMS: All versions prior to V2\\.0 SP1### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)  A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.[CVE\\-2022\\-4203](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4203)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.2 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)  A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that has observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages, the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ). 3\\.2\\.3 [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)  The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds, then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial\\-of\\-service condition. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4450)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.4 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)  The public API function BIO\\_new\\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_ASN1\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_CMS\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_PKCS7\\_stream, SMIME\\_write\\_ASN1, SMIME\\_write\\_CMS and SMIME\\_write\\_PKCS7\\. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\\_ASN1\\_bio\\_stream, BIO\\_new\\_CMS, BIO\\_new\\_PKCS7, i2d\\_CMS\\_bio\\_stream and i2d\\_PKCS7\\_bio\\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.[CVE\\-2023\\-0215](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0215)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.5 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)  An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i\\_PKCS7(), d2i\\_PKCS7\\_bio() or d2i\\_PKCS7\\_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.[CVE\\-2023\\-0216](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0216)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.6 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)  An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP\\_PKEY\\_public\\_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140\\-3\\.[CVE\\-2023\\-0217](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0217)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.7 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)  There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.[CVE\\-2023\\-0286](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0286)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.8 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)  A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signed\\-and\\-enveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library, but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available, the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function, which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API, most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers, or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions, however third party applications would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.[CVE\\-2023\\-0401](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0401)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.9 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)  The AES\\-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer, leading to a crash. Applications that use the AES\\-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES\\-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption. The AES\\-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service. If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer being decrypted by an application using AES\\-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a low severity one.[CVE\\-2023\\-1255](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1255)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.10 [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE\\-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)  schema\\_element defeats protective search\\_path changes; it was found that certain database calls in PostgreSQL could permit an authenticated attacker with elevated database\\-level privileges to execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2023\\-2454](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2454)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.11 [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE\\-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)  Row security policies disregard user ID changes after inlining; PostgreSQL could permit incorrect policies to be applied in certain cases where role\\-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles. This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re\\-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise\\-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.[CVE\\-2023\\-2455](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2455)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ). 3\\.2\\.12 [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)  Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be very slow. Applications that use OBJ\\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a denial of service. An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers \\- sub\\-identifiers \\- most of which have no size limit. OBJ\\_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1\\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub\\-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods. When one of the sub\\-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of kBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(square(n)) with 'n' being the size of the sub\\-identifiers in bytes. With OpenSSL 3\\.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data. Applications that call OBJ\\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low. In OpenSSL 3\\.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature. The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100 kB limit on the peer's certificate chain. Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication. In OpenSSL 1\\.1\\.1 and 1\\.0\\.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a denial of service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is therefore considered low.[CVE\\-2023\\-2650](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2650)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). 3\\.2\\.13 [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)  The AES\\-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Applications that use the AES\\-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. The AES\\-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data, the application has to call EVP\\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\\_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES\\-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As this issue does not affect non\\-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries, this is qualified as low severity issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-2975](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2975)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ). 3\\.2\\.14 [INEFFICIENT REGULAR EXPRESSION COMPLEXITY CWE\\-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)  Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However, the DH\\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value, even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial\\-of\\-service attack. The function DH\\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_ex() and EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '\\-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-3446](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3446)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE\\-2023\\-3446, it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial\\-of\\-service attack.
