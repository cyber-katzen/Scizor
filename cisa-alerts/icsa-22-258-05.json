MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to [V1\\.0 SP2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109812610/sinec-ins-v1-0-service-pack-2-software-(including-10-node-demo)-download-?lc=en-ww)  or later. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found [here](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/topic-areas/industrial-security.html)  . For more information about these issues, see Siemens\u2019 security advisory SSA\\-637483 [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-637483.html) [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-637483.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
