See the update below.** ***End of Update***### **SUMMARY*****Note:**  This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.*  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known CL0P ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 2023\\. According to open source information, beginning on May 27, 2023, CL0P Ransomware Gang, also known as TA505, began exploiting a previously unknown SQL injection vulnerability ( [CVE\\-2023\\-34362](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34362 \"CVE-2023-34362\")  ) in Progress Software's managed file transfer (MFT) solution known as MOVEit Transfer. Internet\\-facing MOVEit Transfer web applications were infected with a web shell named LEMURLOOT, which was then used to steal data from underlying MOVEit Transfer databases. In similar spates of activity, TA505 conducted zero\\-day\\-exploit\\-driven campaigns against Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) devices in 2020 and 2021, and Fortra/Linoma GoAnywhere MFT servers in early 2023\\. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of CL0P ransomware and other ransomware incidents.

See* [*MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise*](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\")*for all referenced tactics and techniques.*  Appearing in February 2019, and evolving from the CryptoMix ransomware variant, CL0P was leveraged as a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) in large\\-scale spear\\-phishing campaigns that used a verified and digitally signed binary to bypass system defenses. CL0P was previously known for its use of the \u2018double extortion\u2019 tactic of stealing and encrypting victim data, refusing to restore victim access and publishing exfiltrated data on Tor via the CL0P^\\_\\-LEAKS website. In 2019, TA505 actors leveraged CL0P ransomware as the final payload of a phishing campaign involving a macro\\-enabled document that used a Get2 malware dropper for downloading SDBot and FlawedGrace. In recent campaigns beginning 2021, CL0P preferred to rely mostly on data exfiltration over encryption. Beyond CL0P ransomware, TA505 is known for frequently changing malware and driving global trends in criminal malware distribution. Considered to be one of the largest phishing and malspam distributors worldwide, TA505 is estimated to have compromised more than 3,000 U.S.\\-based organizations and 8,000 global organizations. TA505 has operated:* A RaaS and has acted as an affiliate of other RaaS operations,* As an initial access broker (IAB), selling access to compromised corporate networks,* As a customer of other IABs,* And as a large botnet operator specializing in financial fraud and phishing attacks. In a campaign from 2020 to 2021, TA505 used several zero\\-day exploits to install a web shell named DEWMODE on internet\\-facing Accellion FTA servers. Similarly, the recent exploitation of MOVEit Transfer, a SQL injection vulnerability was used to install the web shell, which enabled TA505 to execute operating system commands on the infected server and steal data. In late January 2023, the CL0P ransomware group launched a campaign using a zero\\-day vulnerability, now catalogued as [CVE\\-2023\\-0669](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0669 \"CVE-2023-0669\")  , to target the GoAnywhere MFT platform. The group claimed to have exfiltrated data from the GoAnywhere MFT platform that impacted approximately 130 victims over the course of 10 days. Lateral movement into the victim networks from the GoAnywhere MFT was not identified, suggesting the breach was limited to the GoAnywhere platform itself. Over the next several weeks, as the exfiltrated data was parsed by the group, ransom notes were sent to upper\\-level executives of the victim companies, likely identified through open source research. The ransom notes threatened to publish the stolen files on the CL0P data leak site if victims did not pay the ransom amount.*Figure 1: CL0P Ransom Note* | *Hello, this is the CL0P hacker group.

In May 2023, the CL0P ransomware group exploited a SQL injection zero\\-day vulnerability [CVE\\-2023\\-34362](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34362)  to install a web shell named LEMURLOOT on MOVEit Transfer web applications \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\")  ] \\[ [1](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-day-moveit-data-theft \"Zero-Day Vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer Exploited for Data Theft\")  ]. Lemurloot was used as a method of persistence, information gathering and data stealing in CVE\\-2023\\-34362\\. The webshell imports multiple libraries including \u201cMOVEit.DMZ.ClassLib,\u201d \u201cMOVEit.DMZ.Application.Files,\u201d and \u201cMOVEit.DMZ.Application.Users\u201d to interact with MOVEit managed file transfer software. The web shell was initially observed with the name `human2.aspx`  in an effort to masquerade as the legitimate `human.aspx`  file present as part of MOVEit Transfer software. Upon installation, the web shell creates a random 36 character password to be used for authentication. The web shell interacts with its operators by awaiting HTTP requests containing a header field named X\\-siLock\\-Comment, which must have a value assigned equal to the password established upon the installation of the web shell. After authenticating with the web shell, operators pass commands to the web shell that can:* Retrieve Microsoft Azure system settings, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Blob Storage account, Azure Blob key, and Azure Blob Container using the following query:\t+ **\u201cselect f.id, f.instid, f.folderid, filesize, f.Name as Name, u.LoginName as uploader, fr.FolderPath , fr.name as fname from folders fr, files f left join users u on f.UploadUsername \\= u.Username where f.FolderID \\= fr.ID\u201d (Figure 2\\).*** **Enumerate the underlying SQL database.*** Store a string sent by the operator and then retrieve a file with a name matching the string from the MOVEit Transfer system.* Create a new administrator privileged account with a randomly generated username and LoginName and RealName values set to \u201cHealth Check Service.\u201d* Delete an account with LoginName and RealName values set to \u2018Health Check Service.\u2019![Figure 2 \u2013 Lemurloot webshell code that interacts with Azure](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2023-06/Figure%202%20%E2%80%93%20Lemurloot%20webshell%20code%20that%20interacts%20with%20Azure.png?itok=3gdi88Pd)***Figure 2 \u2013 Lemurloot webshell code that interacts with Azure*** Progress Software announced the discovery of [CVE\\-2023\\-34362](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34362 \"CVE-2023-34362\")  MOVEit Transfer vulnerability and issued guidance on known affected versions, software upgrades, and patching.

These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections to reduce the risk of compromise by CL0P ransomware.* **Reduce threat of malicious actors**  using remote access tools by:\t+ **Auditing remote access tools** \t on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized software.\t+ **Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software** \t to detect abnormal use of programs running as a portable executable \\[\t [CPG 2\\.T](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \t ].\t+ **Using security software** \t to detect instances of remote access software only being loaded in memory.\t+ **Requiring authorized remote access solutions** \t only be used from within your network over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs).\t+ **Blocking both inbound and outbound connections** \t on common remote access software ports and protocols at the network perimeter.* **Implement application controls**  to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs.\t+ Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services**  .

In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:* **Implement a recovery plan**  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).* **Maintain offline backups of data**  and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption to its business practices \\[ [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].* **Require all accounts**  with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) **to comply**  with [National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\")  for developing and managing password policies.\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least eight characters and no more than 64 characters in length \\[\t [CPG 2\\.B](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \t ].\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\t [CPG 2\\.C](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \t ].\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\t [CPG 2\\.G](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \t ].\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\t**Note:** \t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.* **Require multifactor authentication**  for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems \\[ [CPG 2\\.H](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)  ].* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date**  .

To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[ [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)  ].* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software**  on all hosts.* **Disable unused ports**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.V](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)  ].* **Consider adding an email banner to emails**  received from outside your organization \\[ [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)  ].* **Disable hyperlinks**  in received emails.* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable**  (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[ [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)  ].### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring authorities of this CSA recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see table 2\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.### **RESOURCES*** [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")  is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.* Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: [CISA\\-Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\")  .* No\\-cost cyber hygiene services: [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"Cyber Hygiene Services\")  and [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"cisagov / cset\")  .
