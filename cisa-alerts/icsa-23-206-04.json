EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.3\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Johnson Controls Inc.\nEquipment: IQ Wifi 6\nVulnerability: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user to gain account access by conducting a brute force authentication attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Johnson Controls products are affected:\n\nIQ Wifi 6: All firmware versions prior to 2.0.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0Improper Restriction of Execssive Authentication Attempts CWE-307\nIn firmware versions prior to v2.0.2 of Johnson Controls IQ Wifi 6, an unauthorized user could gain account access by conducting a brute force authentication attack.\nCVE-2023-3548 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc. reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk:\n\nUpgrade IQ Wifi 6 firmware to version 2.0.2. (Contact Johnson Controls for assistance)\nThe firmware update will be pushed to all available devices in the field.\nThe firmware update can also be manually loaded by applying the patch tag \u201ciqwifi2.0.2\u201d on the device after navigating to its firmware update page.\n\nFor additional information, see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2023-06 v1.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nSecure physical access.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
