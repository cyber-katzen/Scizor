Ltd\nEquipment: LS ELEC PLC and XG5000\nVulnerability: Inadequate Encryption Strength\n\n2. UPDATE\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-228-02 LS ELECTRIC PLC and XG5000 that was published August 16, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to decrypt credentials and gain full access to the affected programmable logic controller (PLC).\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of LS ELECTRIC PLC, a PLC, and XG5000, a PLC programming software, are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 3 ---------\n\nLS ELECTRIC PLC:\u00a0\n\nXGK-CPUU/H/A/S/E: All versions prior to V3.50\u00a0\nXGI-CPUU/UD/H/S/E: All versions prior to V3.20\u00a0\nXGR-CPUH: All versions prior to V1.80\u00a0\nXGB-XBMS: All versions prior to V3.00\u00a0\nXGB-XBCH: All versions prior to V1.90\u00a0\nXGB-XECH: All versions prior to V1.30\u00a0\n\n\nLS ELECTRIC XG5000: All versions prior to V4.0\n\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 3 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 3 ---------\nPasswords are not adequately encrypted during the communication process between the affected versions of LS ELECTRIC's XG5000 software and the affected LS ELECTRIC PLCs. This could allow an attacker to identify and decrypt the affected PLC password by sniffing the traffic.\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 3 ---------\nCVE-2022-2758 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: South Korea\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nDepartment of information Security Engineering at Soonchunhyang University reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A part 3 of 3 ---------\nLS ELECTRIC recommends that affected users update the firmware of LS ELECTRIC PLC and XG5000 to the newest version available:\n\nLS ELECTRIC PLC: Contact the LS ELECTRIC Technical Center (Worldwide or South Korea) to upgrade the firmware.\nLS ELECTRIC XG5000: Upgrade to version 4.0 or later. Visit LS ELECTRIC Download Center (Worldwide or South Korea) to download the upgrade.\n\n--------- End Update A part 3 of 3 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
