A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nAn attacker with access to the vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the \"username\" parameter in the SNMP configuration.\nCVE-2023-42765\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnera or craft a malicious request.bility. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-319\nAn attacker with access to the network where the affected devices are located could maliciously actions to obtain, via a sniffer, sensitive information exchanged via TCP communications.\nCVE-2023-40544\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe cross-site request forgery token in the request may be predictable or easily guessable allowing attackers to craft a malicious request, which could be triggered by a victim unknowingly. In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker could lead the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally.\nCVE-2023-38579\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nAn attacker with access to the web application with vulnerable software could introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a cross-site scripting payload into the \"dns.0.server\" parameter.\nCVE-2023-45227\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Sweden\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez, Iv\u00e1n Alonso \u00c1lvarez and V\u00edctor Bello Cuevas reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWestermo recommends following best practices for hardening, such as restricting access, disable unused services (attack surface reduction), etc., to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities.\n\nThe reported cross-site scripting vulnerabilities will be mitigated in a future report.\nThe reported cross-origin resource sharing vulnerability will be mitigated in a future report.\nThe reported code injection vulnerability will be mitigated in a future report.\nThe reported cross site request forgery vulnerability was patched in a later WeOS4 version.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
