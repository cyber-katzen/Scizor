MITIGATIONS--------------- ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend updating the ICONICS Suite and MC Works64 software with the latest security patches as they become available. ICONICS Suite security patches may be found [here](https://iconics.force.com/community)  (login required) and MC Works64 security patches may be found [here](https://iconics.com/Support/CERT-MC-Works)  . ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric are releasing security updates as critical fixes/rollup releases and security patches. Refer to the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities, the most recent version of which can be found [here](https://www.iconics.com/certs)  , and to the Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s [security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-008_en.pdf)  for information on the availability of the security updates. Note: ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric products version 10\\.97\\.2 and later are not vulnerable to these exploits. ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend users of these products take the following mitigation steps:* Use a firewall; consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Place control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Restrict access to all TCP ports such as port 38080 and 6002\\. If remote access is required, utilize secure remote access methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the internet.* Minimize the attack surface by turning off services and point managers which will not be used.* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Install the applicable critical fixes/rollup releases when available. Mitsubishi Electric also recommends specific action for specific versions of MC Works64:* For users with MC Works64 Version 4\\.00 through 4\\.03D, contact Mitsubishi Electric to receive the Version 4\\.04E installer. Apply the latest security patches once updated.* For users with MC Works64 Version 3\\.04E and prior, contact Mitsubishi Electric for assistance. Additional information and useful links are found on the ICONICS [GENESIS64 security updates](https://iconics.com/certs)  page. Additional information and useful links are found on Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s [security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-008_en.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
