A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCLUSION OF FUNCTIONALITY FROM UNTRUSTED CONTROL SPHERE CWE-829\nGraphWorX64 scripting, contained in all ICONICS Suite products and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products, is based on JScript and .NET. It stores script code in the GraphWorX64 project files. These project files could be directly edited that could result in code execution if exploited.\nCVE-2022-33317 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nGenBrokerX64, contained in all ICONICS Suite products and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products, contains a deserialization vulnerability that could result in remote code execution if exploited.\nCVE-2022-33318 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nGenBrokerX64, contained in all ICONICS Suite products and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products, contains an out-of-bounds read issue which could result in information disclosure or a denial-of-service condition if exploited.\nCVE-2022-33319 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nAll ICONICS Suite and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products contain a deserialization vulnerability that could enable malicious project configuration files to execute arbitrary code via XML code on the files.\nCVE-2022-33320 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: ICONICS is headquartered in the United States; Mitsubishi Electric is headquartered in Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nChris Anastasio, Noam Moshe of Claroty Research, Steven Seeley, Alex Birmberg, Ben McBride, and Axel '0vercl0k' Souchet, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend updating the ICONICS Suite and MC Works64 software with the latest security patches as they become available. ICONICS Suite security patches may be found here (login required) and MC Works64 security patches may be found here.\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric are releasing security updates as critical fixes/rollup releases and security patches. Refer to the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities, the most recent version of which can be found here, and to the Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s security advisory for information on the availability of the security updates. Note: ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric products version 10.97.2 and later are not vulnerable to these exploits.\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend users of these products take the following mitigation steps:\n\nUse a firewall; consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Place control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nRestrict access to all TCP ports such as port 38080 and 6002. If remote access is required, utilize secure remote access methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the internet.\nMinimize the attack surface by turning off services and point managers which will not be used.\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nInstall the applicable critical fixes/rollup releases when available.\n\nMitsubishi Electric also recommends specific action for specific versions of MC Works64:\n\nFor users with MC Works64 Version 4.00 through 4.03D, contact Mitsubishi Electric to receive the Version 4.04E installer. Apply the latest security patches once updated.\nFor users with MC Works64 Version 3.04E and prior, contact Mitsubishi Electric for assistance.\n\nAdditional information and useful links are found on the ICONICS GENESIS64 security updates page.\nAdditional information and useful links are found on Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
