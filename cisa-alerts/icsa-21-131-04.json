MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\nOnly HMI image versions prior to v16 Update 3a are affected. Siemens recommends updating the HMI Panel, as included in the following products:\n\nSINAMICS GH150: Update to v16 Update 4 or later\nSINAMICS GL150 (with option X30): Update to v16 Update 4 or later\nSINAMICS GM150 (with option X30): Update to v16 Update 4 or later\nSINAMICS SH150: Update to v16 Update 4 or later\nSINAMICS SM120: Update to v16 Update 4 or later\nSINAMICS SL150: Update to v15 SP1 Update 6 or later\nSINAMICS SM150: Update to v15 SP1 Update 6 or later\nSINAMICS SM150i: Update to v15 SP1 Update 6 or later\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nRestrict access to Port 5900/TCP to trusted IP addresses only\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nDisable Sm@rtServer in the SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels system component of SINAMICS. If this is not possible, apply defense-in-depth principles. Note: Sm@rtServer is disabled by default but can be enabled on request by the system integrator.\nFollow SINAMICS MV industrial security guidelines.\nFor any questions regarding update, please contact Siemens customer service or the system integrator.\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor additional information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-286838\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a\u00a0high attack complexity.\n",
