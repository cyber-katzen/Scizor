[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryOmron NS Series HMI Vulnerabilities=================================== Last Revised January 31, 2019 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-203\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Researcher Joel Sevilleja Febrer of S2 Grupo has identified multiple vulnerabilities in Omron Corporation\u2019s NS series human\\-machine interface (HMI) terminals. Omron Corporation has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Omron Corporation products are affected:* NS15 Version 8\\.1xx \\- 8\\.68x,* NS12 Version 8\\.1xx \\- 8\\.68x,* NS10 Version 8\\.1xx \\- 8\\.68x,* NS8 Version 8\\.1xx \\- 8\\.68x, and* NS5 Version 8\\.1xx \\- 8\\.68x.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify device configuration and expose sensitive information. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Omron Corporation is an international company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. The affected products are NS series HMI terminals. According to Omron Corporation, NS series HMI terminals are marketed globally; however, Omron states the vulnerabilities only affect their overseas market. The NS series HMI terminals are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing and Healthcare and Public Health.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### CROSS\\-SITE REQUEST FORGERYCWE\\-352: Cross\\-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352\\.html, web site last accessed July 22, 2014\\. The web application receives a request from a client without adequately verifying that the request was intentionally sent. This could allow an attacker to execute commands thereby compromising the system and enabling modifications to the system\u2019s configuration.

The updates for the NS series of HMI terminals can be downloaded at the following locations: NS15 Software Update Version 8\\.7:<http://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns15/default.html> NS12 Software Update Version 8\\.7:<http://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns12/default.html> NS10 Software Update Version 8\\.7:<http://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns10/default.html> NS8 Software Update Version 8\\.7:<http://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns8/default.html> NS5 Software Update Version 8\\.7:<http://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns5/default.html> ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
