Omron Corporation has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Omron Corporation products are affected:\n\nNS15 Version 8.1xx - 8.68x,\nNS12 Version 8.1xx - 8.68x,\nNS10 Version 8.1xx - 8.68x,\nNS8 Version 8.1xx - 8.68x, and\nNS5 Version 8.1xx - 8.68x.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify device configuration and expose sensitive information.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nOmron Corporation is an international company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan.\nThe affected products are NS series HMI terminals. According to Omron Corporation, NS series HMI terminals are marketed globally; however, Omron states the vulnerabilities only affect their overseas market. The NS series HMI terminals are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing and Healthcare and Public Health.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERYCWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html, web site last accessed July 22, 2014.\n\nThe web application receives a request from a client without adequately verifying that the request was intentionally sent. This could allow an attacker to execute commands thereby compromising the system and enabling modifications to the system\u2019s configuration.\nCVE-2014-2369NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2369 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2013-0214&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N, web site last accessed July 22, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a high to moderate skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities\nMITIGATION\nOmron Corporation has produced update, Version 8.69x for Japan and Version 8.7x for other countries, that mitigates the identified vulnerabilities. The updates for the NS series of HMI terminals can be downloaded at the following locations:\nNS15 Software Update Version 8.7:\nhttp://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns15/default.html\nNS12 Software Update Version 8.7:\nhttp://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns12/default.html\nNS10 Software Update Version 8.7:\nhttp://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns10/default.html\nNS8 Software Update Version 8.7:\nhttp://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns8/default.html\nNS5 Software Update Version 8.7:\nhttp://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/hmi/scalable_hmi/ns5/default.html\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
