MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Philips recommends the following mitigations:\n \n\n\n* For vulnerabilities CVE\\-2020\\-36518, CVE\\-2020\\-11113, CVE\\-2020\\-35728, CVE\\-2021\\-20190, CVE\\-2020\\-14061, CVE\\-2020\\-10673, CVE\\-2019\\-12814, CVE\\-2017\\-17485, CVE\\-2023\\-40223, and CVE\\-2023\\-40159, Philips recommends upgrading to the latest Vue PACS version 12\\.2\\.8\\.400\\* released in August 2023\\.\n* For CVE\\-2021\\-28165, Philips recommends configuring the Vue PACS environment per D000763414 \u2013 Vue\\_PACS\\_12\\_Ports\\_Protocols\\_Services\\_Guide available on\n [Incenter](http://incenter.medical.philips.com/Default.aspx?tabid=867) \n . Philips also recommends upgrading to the Vue PACS version 12\\.2\\.8\\.410\\* released in October 2023\\.\n* For CVE\\-2023\\-40704 and CVE\\-2023\\-40539, Philips recommends configuring the Vue PACS environment per 8G7607 \u2013 Vue PACS User Guide Rev G available on\n [Incenter](http://incenter.medical.philips.com/Default.aspx?tabid=867) \n .\n\n\n\n For managed services customers, new releases will be made available upon resource availability. Releases are subject to country specific regulations. Users with questions regarding their specific Philips Vue PACS installations and new release eligibility should contact their local Philips Sales representative or submit a request in the\n [Philips Informatics Support portal](https://usdhs-my.sharepoint.com/personal/grayson_gaylor_associates_cisa_dhs_gov1/_layouts/15/www.informatics.support.philips.com/csm) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Refer to the\n [Philips advisory](http://www.philips.com/productsecurity) \n for more details.\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n \n\n\n5\\.
