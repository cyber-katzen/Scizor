EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor:\u00a0Carlo Gavazzi\nEquipment:\u00a0Powersoft\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access and retrieve any file from the server.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Carlo Gavazzi Powersoft, an energy management software, are affected:\n\nPowersoft: Versions 2.1.1.1 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nCarlo Gavazzi Powersoft versions 2.1.1.1 and prior have a directory traversal vulnerability that can allow an attacker to access and retrieve any file through specially crafted GET requests to the server.\nCVE-2017-20184 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof-of-concept as authored by James Fitts.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCarlo Gavazzi will not issue a fix as this product is end-of-life.\nUsers should contact Carlo Gavazzi for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
