MITIGATIONS\nHoneywell recommends users upgrade Experion Platforms to version R520.2. Download information includes the following:\n\nProduct: Experion PKS, LX, & PlantCruise\nVersion: R520.2\nFor instructions on this process:\n\nGo to the Honeywell Website and sign in.\nSelect \u201cSupport\u201d at the top of the web page.\nSelect \u201cProduct Documents & Downloads.\u201d\nIn the given search box, search for: \u201cExperion PKS R520.2\u201d, \u201cExperion LX R520.2\u201d or \u201cExperion PlantCruise R520.2\u201d and select the hyperlink for the given Experion platform.\n\n\n\nHoneywell advises users to follow security best practices for Experion platform environments to ensure access is limited to authorized users only. Users should ensure the backup files are maintained in a network location or physical drive with access limited to authorized users only and should not share them.\nHoneywell Security Notifications are available on the Honeywell website.\u00a0 For access, users should visit the Honeywell website and sign in, select the search icon at the top of the web page, and search for \u201cSN2023-06-22\u201d.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n",
