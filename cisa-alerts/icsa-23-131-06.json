For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.9\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\nEquipment:\u00a0SCALANCE LPE9403\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Command Injection, Creation of Temporary File with Insecure Permissions,\u00a0Path Traversal, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain access to the device as root or create a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products from Siemens are affected:\u00a0\n\n\nSCALANCE LPE9403 (6GK5998-3GS00-2AC2): Versions prior to 2.1\n\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nThe web-based management of affected devices does not properly validate user input, making it susceptible to command injection. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access the underlying operating system as root.\nCVE-2023-27407 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0CREATION OF TEMPORARY FILE WITH INSECURE PERMISSIONS CWE-378\nThe `i2c` mutex file is created with the permissions bits of `-rw-rw-rw-.` This file is used as a mutex for multiple applications interacting with i2c. This could allow an authenticated attacker with access to the secure shell (SSH) interface on the affected device to interfere with the integrity of the mutex and the data it protects.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-27408 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nA path traversal vulnerability was found in the `deviceinfo` binary via the `mac` parameter. This could allow an authenticated attacker with access to the SSH interface on the affected device to read the contents of any file named `address.`\nCVE-2023-27409 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the `edgebox_web_app` binary. The binary will crash if supplied with a backup password longer than 255 characters. This could allow an authenticated privileged attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-27410 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workaround/mitigation users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE LPE9403 (6GK5998-3GS00-2AC2): Update to V2.1 or later version.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens Industrial Security webpage.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-325383 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\u00a0\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\u00a0\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\u00a0\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
