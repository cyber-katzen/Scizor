EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: GE\nEquipment: Gigasoft component of iFix\nVulnerability: Unsafe ActiveX Control Marked Safe For Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a buffer overflow condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nGE reports this vulnerability in a Gigasoft component affects the following iFix HMI products:\n\niFIX 2.0 - 5.0\niFIX 5.1,\niFIX 5.5, and\niFIX 5.8\n\nGigasoft components older than Version 8.0 are likely to be used in other products from other vendors also.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNSAFE ACTIVEX CONTROL MARKED SAFE FOR SCRIPTING CWE-623\nMultiple instances of this vulnerability have been identified in the third-party ActiveX object provided to GE iFIX by Gigasoft. Only the independent use of the Gigasoft charting package outside the iFIX product may expose users to the reported vulnerability. The reported method shown to impact Internet Explorer is not exposed in the iFIX product, nor is the core functionality of the iFIX product known to be impacted.\nCVE-2018-17925 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nLiMingzheng of 360 aegis security team reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGE released iFIX 5.9 in June 2017 to address this issue by incorporating Gigasoft Version 8.0\nGE recommends users only use ActiveX from trusted sources.\nTo obtain the latest versions of the iFIX product, please contact the local GE Digital representative. Contact information is available at:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/CC_Contact\nFor more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see GE Security Communication GED SecComm 18-01 dated March 27, 2018 on the GE website:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/KB0024470\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
