  "markdown": "\nOVERVIEW\nBill Voltmer of Elation Technologies LLC has identified vulnerabilities in OmniMetrix\u2019s OmniView web application. OmniMetrix has produced a new software version for its web interface that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following OmniView versions are affected:\n\nOmniView, Version 1.2\n\nIMPACT\nExploiting these vulnerabilities could compromise account credentials that may allow an attacker to control the operation of backup generators connected to the compromised account.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nOmniMetrix is a US-based company that is headquartered in Buford, Georgia.\nThe affected web interface, OmniView, is a data management control center that is used to monitor and control backup generators. OmniView is only accessible from OmniMetrix\u2019s web site. According to OmniMetrix, its services are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities and Energy. OmniMetrix estimates that its services are primarily used in the United States with a small number of users in Europe, Asia, and South America.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATIONCWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html, web site last accessed December 15, 2016.\n\nThe OmniView web application transmits credentials with the HTTP protocol, which could be sniffed by an attacker that may result in the compromise of account credentials.\nCVE-2016-5786NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5786, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed December 15, 2016.\n\nWEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTSCWE-521: Weak Password Requirements, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html, web site last accessed December 15, 2016.\n\nInsufficient password requirements for the OmniView web application may allow an attacker to gain access by brute forcing account passwords.\nCVE-2016-5801NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5801, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed December 15, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nOmniMetrix has deployed a new version of OmniView software that resolves the reported vulnerabilities. OmniMetrix reports that it has implemented the use of HTTPS protocol and enforces strong password requirements. When OmniMetrix\u2019s users log into the OmniMetrix web site, they will be prompted to change passwords. OmniMetrix recommends that users log into their accounts as soon as possible to change their passwords:\nhttps://webdata.omnimetrix.net/omxphp/omxLogin.php\nFor additional information about the new version of OmniView, contact OmniMetrix at:\nhttps://www.omnimetrix.net/en/support/customer-support/\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
