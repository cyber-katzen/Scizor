For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens \u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Improper Input Validation\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to create a malicious file loaded by OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (running as a high-privilege user).\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nOpenPCS 7 V9.1: All versions \u00a0\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V14: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V15: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V16: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V17: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V18: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC Process Historian OPC UA Server: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC WinCC: All versions prior to V8.0\u00a0\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC WinCC Unified PC Runtime: All versions prior to V18.0 UPD 1 SR 1\u00a0\nTeleControl Server Basic V3: All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\u00a0\nOPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (LDS) in affected products uses a hard-coded file path to a configuration file. This could allow a normal user to create a malicious file that is loaded by LDS (running as a high-privilege user).\u00a0\nCVE-2022-44725\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nSiemens OpenPCS 7 V9.1: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC NET PC Software V14: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC NET PC Software V15: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC NET PC Software V16: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC NET PC Software V17: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC NET PC Software V18: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC Process Historian OPC UA Server: All versions.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens TeleControl Server Basic V3: Currently, no fix is available.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC: Update to\u00a0V8.0\u00a0or later version.\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC Unified PC Runtime: Update to\u00a0V18.0 UPD 1 SR 1\u00a0or later version.\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\u00a0\n\nUpdate the underlying OPC Foundation Unified Architecture Local Discovery Server (UA-LDS) to\u00a0V1.04.405\u00a0or later if possible.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines\u00a0for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\u00a0\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-691715 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. \u00a0\n",
