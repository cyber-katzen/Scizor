EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.3\u00a0\nATTENTION: High attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Emerson\u00a0\nEquipment: ROC800, ROC800L and DL8000\u00a0\nVulnerability: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\u00a0\n\nCISA is aware of a public report, known as \u201cOT:ICEFALL\u201d that details vulnerabilities found in multiple operational technology (OT) vendors. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.\u00a0\n2. RISK EVALUATION\n\u202fSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause file manipulation.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ROC800, a remote automation controller, are affected:\u00a0\n\nROC800: All versions\u00a0\nROC800L: All versions\u00a0\nDL8000: All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345\nThe affected product uses the ROC protocol for communications, which could allow an attacker to read, write and delete file or folder operations.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-30264 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\n\u202fDaniel dos Santos and Jos Wetzels from Forescout Technologies reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEmerson recommends users follow the guidance given in the ROC800-Series Remote Operations Controller Instruction Manual under section 1.11 Secure Gateway D301766X012\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
