[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHitachi Energy Relion 670, 650 and SAM600\\-IO Series==================================================== Release Date March 09, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-068\\-051\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 4\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  Relion 670, 650, and SAM600\\-IO Series* **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) to restart, causing a temporary denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Hitachi Energy reports this vulnerability affects the following Relion 670, 650 and SAM600\\-IO Series products:* Relion 670/650 series version 2\\.2\\.0* Relion 670/650/SAM600\\-io series version 2\\.2\\.1* Relion 670 series version 2\\.2\\.2* Relion 670 series version 2\\.2\\.3* Relion 670/650 series version 2\\.2\\.4* Relion 670/650 series version 2\\.2\\.5### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE\\-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html) The Hitachi Energy Relion update package signature validation contains an improper access control vulnerability. A tampered update package could cause the IED to restart. After a restart, the device returns to normal operation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by gaining access to the system with security privileges and then attempting to update the IED with a malicious update package. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the IED to restart, causing a temporary denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-3864](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3864)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Nozomi Networks Labs reported this vulnerability to Hitachi Energy.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends users disable Field Service Tool access and only enable it on an as\\-needed basis, such as for planned upgrades. Hitachi Energy recommends the following general mitigation factors and security practices:* Configure firewalls to protect process control networks from attacks originating from outside the network.* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Avoid directly connecting control systems to the internet.* Separate process control networks from other networks via a firewall system with minimal exposed ports.* Users should not use process control systems for internet surfing, instant messaging, or email.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system.* Enforce proper password policies and processes. For more information, see Hitachi security advisory [8DBD000146](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000146)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
