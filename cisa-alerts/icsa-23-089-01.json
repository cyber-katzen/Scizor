Such practices include:\u00a0\n\nPhysically protecting process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\nNot allowing direct connections to the internet.\n\nProcess control systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.\n\n\nUse a firewall system that has a minimal number of exposed ports to separate the process control network from other networks.\u00a0\n\nConnection to other networks must be evaluated as necessary.\u00a0\n\n\nScan portable computers and removable storage media carefully for viruses before connection to a control system.\n\n\nMSM is not designed nor intended to be connected to the internet. Disconnect the device from any internet facing network.\n\nAdopt user access management and updated antivirus protection engines equipped with the latest signature rules for computers that have installed and are operating the MMS Client application.\u00a0\nUse the default operating system (OS) user access management function to limit unauthorized access and/or rogue commands via the MMS Client application.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the Hitachi Energy advisories for the corresponding affected products:\u00a0\n\n8DBD000124 TXpert Hub CoreTec 4 and 5 Products\u00a0\n8DBD000132 RTU500 series\u00a0\n8DBD000127 Relion 670, 650 series, and SAM600-IO\u00a0\n8DBD000131 REB500 series\u00a0\n8DBD000130 PWC600\u00a0\n8DBD000129 MSM\u00a0\n8DBD000133 MicroSCADA X SYS600\u00a0\n8DBD000128 ITT600 SA Explorer\u00a0\n8DBD000126 GMS600\u00a0\n8DBD000125 FOX61x TEGO1\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
