Such practices include:\t+ Physically protecting process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\t+ Not allowing direct connections to the internet.\t\t- Process control systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.\t+ Use a firewall system that has a minimal number of exposed ports to separate the process control network from other networks.\t\t- Connection to other networks must be evaluated as necessary.\t+ Scan portable computers and removable storage media carefully for viruses before connection to a control system.* MSM is not designed nor intended to be connected to the internet. Disconnect the device from any internet facing network.\t+ Adopt user access management and updated antivirus protection engines equipped with the latest signature rules for computers that have installed and are operating the MMS Client application.\t+ Use the default operating system (OS) user access management function to limit unauthorized access and/or rogue commands via the MMS Client application.
