RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to intercept sensitive communications, establish a man-in-the-middle attack, achieve administrator privileges, and execute remote code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following PEPPERL+FUCHS product families are affected:\n\nVisuNet RM All models,\nVisuNet PC All models, and\nBTC All models.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nAn authentication vulnerability within CredSSP may allow interception of user credentials resulting in remote code execution.\nCVE-2018-0886 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV: N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nEyal Karni, Yaron Zinar, and Roman Blachman with Preempt Research Labs reported this vulnerability to PEPPRL+FUCHS, who then reported it to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPEPPRL+FUCHS recommends users using HMI devices within VisuNet RM, VisuNet PC or BTC product families follow these guidelines:\n\nPEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running RM Shell 4 should be updated with \u2018RM Image 4 Security Patches 01/2017 to 05/2018\u2019 (18-33400C):\n\nhttps://www.pepperl-fuchs.com/cgi-bin/db/doci.pl/?ShowDocByDocNo=18-33400c\n\nPEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running RM Shell 5 should be updated with \u2018RM Image 5 Security: Windows Cumulative Security Patch 07/2018\u2019 (18-33624):\n\nhttps://www.pepperl-fuchs.com/cgi-bin/db/doci.pl/?ShowDocByDocNo=18-33624\n\nPEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running Windows 7 or Windows 10 should be updated by using the Windows Update mechanism. See Microsoft\u2019s security bulletin for more information:\n\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0866\n\nAfter deploying the patch, all connected third-party clients or servers must use the latest version of the CredSSP protocol.\nBe aware of the importance of installing these patches, as security will be enforced by the update. Security by default restriction might result in an error due to encryption oracle remediation. Updates should be installed on both the server and the HMI device; otherwise, system compatibility might be influenced.\n\nFor more information CERT@VDE has released a security advisory found at:\nhttps://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2018-008\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
