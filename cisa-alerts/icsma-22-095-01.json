EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: LifePoint Informatics\nEquipment: Patient Portal\nVulnerability: Authentication Bypass Using Alternate Path or Channel\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could disclose sensitive information, including HIPAA-protected PII.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of LifePoint Informatics Patient Portal, a website containing patient health data, is affected:\n\nPatient Portal Version LPI 3.5.12.P30\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\nNavigating to a specific URL with a patient ID number will result in the server generating a PDF of a lab report without authentication and rate limiting.\nCVE-2022-1067 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAndrew Perrong reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nLifePoint Informatics released and deployed updated Version LPI 3.5.15 in February of 2022, which mitigated this vulnerability. LifePoint Informatics Patient Portal is a hosted application and users don\u2019t need to take any action.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
