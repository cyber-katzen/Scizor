An independent research group composed of Nadia Heninger (University of California at San Diego), J. Alex Halderman,\u00a0Zakir Durumeric, and\u00a0Eric Wustrow (all from the University of Michigan) identified an\n [insufficient entropy vulnerability](https://factorable.net/paper.html) \n in authentication key generation in the Post Oak AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic System. By impersonating the device, an attacker can obtain the credentials of administrative users and potentially perform a Man\\-in\\-the\\-Middle (MitM) attack. Post Oak has validated the vulnerability and produced an updated firmware version that mitigates the vulnerability. According to Post Oak, its products are deployed in the transportation sector, mainly in the United States.\n \n\n\n\n This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\nAffected Products\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following Post Oak products are affected:\n \n\n\n* AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic System, all versions.\n\n\nImpact\n------\n\n\n\n An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system by determining the authentication keys from reused or nonunique host keys. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform a MitM attack to affect the availability of the system and access data and settings.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\n\n Post Oak Traffic Systems is a US\\-based company that specializes in low cost traffic monitoring in both freeway and arterial environments. Post Oak uses licensed patent pending technology developed by the Texas A\\&M Transportation Institute, a transportation research organization.\n \n\n\n\n The affected products are Bluetooth wireless traffic monitoring systems. According to Post Oak, the product is deployed in the transportation sector. Post Oak estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States.\n \n\n\nVulnerability Characterization\n------------------------------\n\n\n### Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### Insufficient EntropyCWE, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331\\.html, CWE\\-331: Insufficient Entropy, Web site last accessed November 30, 2012\\.\n\n\n\n The Post Oak AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic Systems does not use sufficient entropy when generating authentication and host keys. By calculating the private authentication keys, an attacker could perform a MitM attack on the system by knowing the nonunique host key. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system and read information on the device, as well as inject data compromising the integrity of the data.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2012\\-4687NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4687, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is\n [(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) \n .\n \n\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\n\n#### Exploitability\n\n\n\n This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\n#### Existence of Exploit\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability\n \n\n\n#### Difficulty\n\n\n\n An attacker with a high skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\n\n\n Post Oak has developed a patch for the AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic System that mitigates the vulnerability. The patch allows the Bluetooth reader to ensure sufficient entropy exists before generating host and authentication keys. The patch will be installed on all new devices when initially configured. Existing equipment will be patched by remote access and upgraded to the latest firmware. System owners are encouraged to contact Post Oak Traffic SystemsPost Oak Traffic Systems, support@postoaktraffic.com, (281\\) 381\\-2887\\. Web site last accessed November 30, 2012\\. with questions patching their systems.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n*.* \n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\\-CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01A) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT Web page](/ics) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Post Oak Traffic Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-12-335-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
