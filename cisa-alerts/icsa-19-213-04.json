EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH\nEquipment: CODESYS V3\nVulnerability: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-213-04 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH CODESYS V3 that was published August 1, 2019, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for an attacker with access to PLC traffic to obtain user credentials.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll variants of the following CODESYS V3 products in all versions containing the CmpUserMgr component are affected, regardless of the CPU type or operating system:\n\nCODESYS Control for BeagleBone\nCODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6\nCODESYS Control for IOT2000\nCODESYS Control for Linux\nCODESYS Control for PFC100\nCODESYS Control for PFC200\nCODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi\nCODESYS Control RTE V3\nCODESYS Control RTE V3 (for Beckhoff CX)\nCODESYS Control Win V3 (also part of the CODESYS Development System setup)\nCODESYS V3 Simulation Runtime (part of the CODESYS Development System)\nCODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit\nCODESYS HMI V3\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nThe application may utilize non-TLS based encryption, which results in user credentials being insufficiently protected during transport.\nCVE-2019-9013 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nJunYoung Park reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH reports this vulnerability will be corrected by downloading Version 3.5.16.0\nFor more information, please see the CODESYS V3 advisory 2019-08.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
