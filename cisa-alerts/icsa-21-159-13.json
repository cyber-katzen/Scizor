An attacker may leverage this to cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2021-31340 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nFor SIMATIC Reader RF devices: Update to v4.0 or later version\nFor SIMATIC RF devices: Update to v1.3.2 where applicable.\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\n\n\n\n\nFor SIMATIC RF360R: Update to v2.0 or later\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nDeactivate the OPC-UA feature of affected devices\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-787292\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
