Schneider Electric has produced an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of ProClima:\n\nVersion 6.1 and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nThese vulnerabilities can be used to modify arbitrary memory and lead to remote code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, ProClima, is a configuration utility used to design control panel enclosures to accommodate the thermal load from the electrical/electronic devices inside and from the environment. According to Schneider Electric, ProClima is used across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Energy. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nREMOTE CODE EXECUTIONCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (\u201cCode Injection\u201d), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html, web site last accessed December 01, 2015.\n\nProClima has 11 vulnerabilities that allow code injection. This could allow the attacker to cause a crash or to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2015-7918NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7918, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L , web site last accessed December 01, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSchneider Electric has developed an update for ProClima software. The update is available at the following URL:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range-download/2560-proclima.\nFor more information on this vulnerability and the associated patch, please see Schneider Electric\u2019s SEVD-2015-329-01, released November 25, 2015:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2015-329-01\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
