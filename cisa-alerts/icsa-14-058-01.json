This vulnerability could allow attackers to start malicious programs as Windows services.\nThis license manager is used in the following Schneider Electric products:\n\nPower Monitoring Expert,\nStruxureware process Expert (PES),\nStruxureware process Expert libraries,\nVijeo Citect (SCADA), and\nVijeo Citect Historian.\n\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric is a European-based company that maintains offices in 190 countries worldwide.\nThese products are industrial active energy management control products, deployed across several sectors including the Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and North America.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNQUOTED SEARCH PATH OR ELEMENTCWE-428: Unquoted Search Path or Element, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/428.html, web site last accessed February 27, 2014.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Floating License Manager has an \u201cunquoted service path\u201d vulnerability. When the executable path of a service contains blanks, attackers can exploit this to execute malicious programs.\nCVE-2014-0759NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0759 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed February 27, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, and the executable path of a service contains blanks. Attackers can exploit this to start malicious programs as Windows service. To avoid this, such service paths in the registry must be surrounded with quotes.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nDeployment of the Schneider Electric products using the vulnerable floating license manager are designed to be automatically updated via the Schneider Electric Software Update system.\nSchneider Electric\u2019s latest download patches and known vulnerabilities are available here:\nhttp://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
