Yokogawa has produced a new release to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nYokogawa reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n\nSTARDOM FCN/FCJ controller (from Version R1.01 to R4.01).\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to execute commands such as stop application program, change values, and modify application.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nYokogawa is based in Japan and maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and East Asia.\nSTARDOM is a network-based control system. According to Yokogawa, these products are deployed across several sectors, including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Food and Agriculture. Yokogawa estimates that its products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html web site last accessed September 15, 2016.\n\nLogic Designer can connect to STARDOM controller without authentication.\nCVE-2016-4860NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4860, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed September 15, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nYokogawa has remediated the vulnerability with the latest release R4.02. The following link leads to Yokogawa\u2019s STARDOM web site:\nhttp://stardom.biz\nYokogawa strongly suggests all users to introduce appropriate security measures not only for the vulnerabilities identified but also to the overall systems.\nYokogawa\u2019s Security Advisory Report, \u201cYSAR-16-0002: Arbitrary command execution vulnerability in STARDOM,\u201d and other Yokogawa products are available at the following URL:\nhttp://www.yokogawa.com/technical-library/resources/white-papers/yokogawa-security-advisory-report-list/\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
