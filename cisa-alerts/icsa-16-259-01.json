The following link leads to Yokogawa\u2019s STARDOM web site:<http://stardom.biz> Yokogawa strongly suggests all users to introduce appropriate security measures not only for the vulnerabilities identified but also to the overall systems. Yokogawa\u2019s Security Advisory Report, \u201cYSAR\\-16\\-0002: Arbitrary command execution vulnerability in STARDOM,\u201d and other Yokogawa products are available at the following URL:[http://www.yokogawa.com/technical\\-library/resources/white\\-papers/yokogawa\\-security\\-advisory\\-report\\-list/](http://www.yokogawa.com/technical-library/resources/white-papers/yokogawa-security-advisory-report-list/)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  .
