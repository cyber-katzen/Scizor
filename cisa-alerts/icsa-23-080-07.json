MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens recommends updating the software to\n [v2\\.0](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109815650) \n or later.\n \n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens webpage for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\n [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-565386 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-565386.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-565386.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\n [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
