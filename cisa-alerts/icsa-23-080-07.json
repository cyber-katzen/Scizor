A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nZlib versions before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-25032\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\u00a0\nA NULL pointer dereference in Busybox's man applet leads to a denial-of-service condition when a section name is supplied but no page argument is given.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-42373\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nAn out-of-bounds heap read in Busybox's unlzma applet leads to an information leak and a denial-of-service condition when crafted LZMA-compressed input is decompressed. This can be triggered by any applet/format that internally supports LZMA compression.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-42374\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\u00a0\nAn incorrect handling of a special element in Busybox's ash applet leads to a denial-of-service condition when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mistaking specific characters for reserved characters. This could be used for a denial-of-service attack under rare conditions of filtered command input.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-42375\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\u00a0\nA NULL pointer dereference in Busybox's hush applet leads to a denial-of-service condition when processing a crafted shell command, due to missing validation after a \\x03 delimiter character. This may be used for a denial-of-service attack under very rare conditions of filtered command input.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-42376\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0RELEASE OF INVALID POINTER OR REFERENCE CWE-763\u00a0\nAn attacker-controlled pointer free in Busybox's hush applet leads to a denial-of-service condition and possible code execution when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mishandling the &&& string. This could be used for remote code execution under rare conditions of filtered command input.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-42377\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating the software to\u00a0v2.0\u00a0or later.\u00a0\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security\u00a0and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens webpage for Industrial Security.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-565386 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
