EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/Low attack complexity\nVendor: Yokogawa\nEquipment: CENTUM\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary programs.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Yokogawa CENTUM, a distributed control system (DCS), are affected:\n\nCENTUM CS 3000 (Including CENTUM CS 3000 Entry Class): Version R3.08.10\u00a0through\u00a0R3.09.50\nCENTUM VP (Including CENTUM VP Entry Class): Version R4.01.00 through R4.03.00\nCENTUM VP (Including CENTUM VP Entry Class): Version R5.01.00 through R5.04.20\nCENTUM VP (Including CENTUM VP Entry Class): Version R6.01.00 through\u00a0R6.11.10\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Improper Access Control CWE-284\nIf an attacker is somehow able to intrude into a computer that installed affected product or access to a shared folder, by replacing the DLL file with a tampered one, it is possible to execute arbitrary programs with the authority of the SYSTEM account.\nCVE-2024-5650 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-5650. A base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJPCERT/CC reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nYokogawa recommends that customers update to CENTUM VP or CENTUM VP Entry Class R6.11.12 or later. CENTUM CS and earlier versions of Centum VP will not be patched because these products are no longer supported.\nYokogawa strongly recommends all customers to establish and maintain a full security program, not just for the vulnerability identified in this advisory. Security program components are: Patch updates, Anti-virus, Backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewall, etc. Yokogawa can assist in setting up and running a security program continuously. Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment for users considering the most effective risk mitigation plan.\nFor questions related to this report, please contact Yokogawa.\nFor more information and details on implementing these mitigations and downloading the latest patch, users should see Yokogawa advisory YSAR-24-0002.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
