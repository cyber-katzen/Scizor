Omron Corporation has produced new versions that mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nOne of the three vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Omron Corporation products are affected:\n\nCX-Programmer software, versions prior to Version 9.6,\nCJ2M Series PLC, versions prior to Version 2.1, and\nCJ2H Series PLC, versions prior to Version 1.5.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the compromise of sensitive account information.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nOmron Corporation is an international company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan.\nThe affected product, CX-Programmer, is part of the CX-One software suite, which is used to configure and program devices such as PLCs and HMIs. The CJ2M series device is a PLC primarily used for packaging and machine automation. The CJ2H series device is a PLC used for machine automation that requires image processing inspection of electrical components and high speed sorting on conveyors. According to Omron Corporation, these products are deployed across the Critical Manufacturing sector. Omron Corporation estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATIONCWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html, web site last accessed October 1, 2015.\n\nThe password is transmitted in clear text to unlock the PLC for modification, which leaves the password vulnerable to packet sniffing.\nCVE-2015-0987NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0987, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

The storage of passwords in recoverable format vulnerabilities is locally exploitable.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nOmron Corporation has released a new version of the CX-Programmer software (Version 9.6) and new versions of the CJ2M series PLC (Version 2.1) and the CJ2H Series PLC (Version 1.5), which resolve the identified vulnerabilities. Omron Corporation recommends installing the new versions as soon as possible.\nThe CX-Programmer software, Version 9.6, is available by auto-update service or at the following URL:\nhttps://industrial.omron.us/en/products/catalogue/automation_systems/software/programming/cx-one/default.html\nThe CJ2M series PLC, Version 2.1 and the CJ2H series PLC, Version 1.5 can be obtained by contacting Omron Corporation\u2019s Customer Care Team:\nhttps://industrial.omron.us/en/services-and-support/customer-care.\nOmron Corporation\u2019s security notice is available at the following URL:\nhttp://www.fa.omron.co.jp/product/special/security_plc/index.html.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should consider the following:\n\nLimit physical and logical access to ICS environments by implementing defense-in-depth strategies.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
