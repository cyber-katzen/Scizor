EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable with adjacent access/low attack complexity\nVendor: Medtronic\nEquipment: MyCareLink Monitor, CareLink Monitor, CareLink 2090 Programmer, specific Medtronic implanted cardiac devices listed below\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSMA-19-080-01 Medtronic Conexus Radio Frequency Telemetry Protocol (Update B) that was published June 4, 2020, to the CISA webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with adjacent short-range access to one of the affected products to interfere with, generate, modify, or intercept the radio frequency (RF) communication of the Medtronic proprietary Conexus telemetry system, potentially impacting product functionality and/or allowing access to transmitted sensitive data. Successful exploitation requires: (1) an RF device capable of transmitting or receiving Conexus telemetry communication, such as a monitor, programmer, or software-defined radio (SDR); (2) to have adjacent short-range access to the affected products; and (3) for the products to be in states where the RF functionality is active. Before the device implant procedure and during follow-up clinic visits, the Conexus telemetry sessions require initiation by an inductive protocol. Outside of these use environments, the RF radio in the affected implanted device is enabled for brief periods of time to support scheduled follow-up transmissions and other operational and safety notifications. The result of successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may include the ability to read and write any valid memory location on the affected implanted device and therefore impact the intended function of the device.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products and versions of Medtronic devices utilizing the Conexus telemetry protocol are affected:\n\nMyCareLink Monitor, Versions 24950 and 24952\nCareLink Monitor, Version 2490C\nCareLink 2090 Programmer\nAmplia CRT-D (all models)\nClaria CRT-D (all models)\nCompia CRT-D (all models)\nConcerto CRT-D (all models)\nConcerto II CRT-D (all models)\nConsulta CRT-D (all models)\nEvera ICD (all models)\nMaximo II CRT-D and ICD (all models)\nMirro ICD (all models)\nNayamed ND ICD (all models)\nPrimo ICD (all models)\nProtecta ICD and CRT-D (all models)\nSecura ICD (all models)\nVirtuoso ICD (all models)\nVirtuoso II ICD (all models)\nVisia AF ICD (all models)\nViva CRT-D (all models)\nBrava CRT-D (all models)\nMirro MRI ICD (all models)\n\nNot all devices may be available in in all geographical locations.\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe Conexus telemetry protocol utilized within this ecosystem does not implement authentication or authorization. An attacker with adjacent short-range access to an affected product, in situations where the product\u2019s radio is turned on, can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept data within the telemetry communication. This communication protocol provides the ability to read and write memory values to affected implanted cardiac devices; therefore, an attacker could exploit this communication protocol to change memory in the implanted cardiac device.\nCVE-2019-6538 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe Conexus telemetry protocol utilized within this ecosystem does not implement encryption. An attacker with adjacent short-range access to a target product can listen to communications, including the transmission of sensitive data.\nCVE-2019-6540 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nPeter Morgan of Clever Security; Dave Singel\u00e9e and Bart Preneel of KU Leuven; Eduard Marin formerly of KU Leuven, currently with University of Birmingham; Flavio D. Garcia; Tom Chothia of the University of Birmingham; and Rik Willems of University Hospital Gasthuisberg Leuven reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMedtronic has applied additional controls for monitoring and responding to improper use of the Conexus telemetry protocol by the affected implanted cardiac devices. Additional mitigations are being developed and will be deployed through future updates, assuming regulatory approval.\nMedtronic has developed mitigating patches for a subset of the affected implanted cardiac device models. These patches are installed during regular office visits. Medtronic has stated that patches for additional impacted models are being developed by Medtronic and will be deployed through future updates. Patches are currently available for the following affected models:\n--------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 1 --------\u00a0\n\nProtecta CRT-D and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), all models\n\n--------- End\u00a0Update C Part 1 of 1 --------\u00a0\n\nAmplia MRI CRT-D, all models (patch available in U.S. only)\nClaria MRI CRT-D, all models (patch available in U.S. only)\nCompia MRI CRT-D, all models (patch available in U.S. only)\nVisia AF MRI ICD, all models\nVisia AF ICD, all models\u00a0\nBrava CRT-D, all models \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nEvera MRI ICD, all models\nEvera ICD, all models\nMirro MRI ICD, all models\nPrimo MRI ICD, all models\nViva CRT-D, all models\n\nMedtronic recommends that users take additional defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMaintain good physical control over home monitors and programmers.\nUse only home monitors, programmers, and implantable devices obtained directly from your healthcare provider or a Medtronic representative to ensure integrity of the system.\nDo not connect unapproved devices to home monitors and programmers through USB ports or other physical connections.\nOnly use programmers to connect and interact with implanted devices in physically controlled hospital and clinical environments.\nOnly use home monitors in private environments such as a home, apartment, or otherwise physically controlled environment.\nReport any concerning behavior regarding these products to your healthcare provider or a Medtronic representative.\n\nMedtronic has released additional patient focused information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nRestrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.\nApply defense-in-depth strategies.\nDisable unnecessary accounts and services.\nWhere additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
