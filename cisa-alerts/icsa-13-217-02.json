Timur Yunusov, Alexey Osipov, and Ilya\u00a0Karpov of Positive Technologies reported the vulnerability directly to Schneider Electric. Schneider Electric has produced patches that mitigate this vulnerability.\n \n\n\nAffected Products\n-----------------\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n \n\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vijeo Citect Version 7\\.20 and all previous versions,\n \n\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CitectSCADA Version 7\\.20 and all previous versions, and\n \n\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PowerLogic SCADA Version 7\\.20 and all previous versions.\n \n\n\nImpact\n------\n\n\n\n The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of confidential information by allowing access to local files and internal resources or cause the server to potentially execute arbitrary HTTP requests, or affect system availability.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric is a manufacturer and integrator of energy management and industrial automation systems, equipment, and software. The affected Schneider Electric systems are found\u00a0primarily in energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure applications. Schneider Electric reports operations in over 100 countries worldwide.\n \n\n\nVulnerability Characterization\n------------------------------\n\n\n### Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n### Improper Restriction of XML External Entity ReferenceCWE\\-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611\\.html, Web site last accessed August 05, 2013\\.\n\n\n\n\n The affected products can process an XML document that can contain XML entities with URLs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2013\\-2796VD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-2796, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report.
