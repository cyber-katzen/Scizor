Apply CVE-2022-29826 or CVE-2022-29829 mitigations for GX Works3 as well.\n\n\n\nFor all other listed vulnerabilities, Mitsubishi Electric released mitigations/workarounds for users to follow:\n\nEnsure malicious actors cannot access project files, configuration files, security keys stored on the host machine via untrusted networks or hosts.\nInstall antivirus software on the host machine running the software.\nEncrypt project files and security keys when sending or receiving over the internet.\nUse the \"authentication with a certificate\" function instead of \"username / password authentication\" for user authentication for access from OPC UA clients to MELSEC iQ-R series OPC UA server modules (MX OPC UA Module Configurator-R only).\n\nFor specific update instructions and additional details see the Mitsubishi Electric advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
