Apply CVE\\-2022\\-29826 or CVE\\-2022\\-29829 mitigations for GX Works3 as well. For all other listed vulnerabilities, Mitsubishi Electric released mitigations/workarounds for users to follow:* Ensure malicious actors cannot access project files, configuration files, security keys stored on the host machine via untrusted networks or hosts.* Install antivirus software on the host machine running the software.* Encrypt project files and security keys when sending or receiving over the internet.* Use the \"authentication with a certificate\" function instead of \"username / password authentication\" for user authentication for access from OPC UA clients to MELSEC iQ\\-R series OPC UA server modules (MX OPC UA Module Configurator\\-R only). For specific update instructions and additional details see the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-015_en.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
