RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate privileges in the affected device\u2019s default configuration, resulting in remote code execution or deleting system files and folders.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Keysight monitoring products are affected:* N6854A Geolocation Server versions 2\\.4\\.2 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE\\-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) N6854A Geolocation Server versions 2\\.4\\.2 are vulnerable to untrusted data deserialization, which may allow a malicious actor to escalate privileges in the affected device\u2019s default configuration and achieve remote code execution.[CVE\\-2023\\-1399](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1399)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Communications, Government* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER An anonymous individual working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Keysight recommends upgrading the N6854A Geolocation server to version [2\\.4\\.3](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/lib/software-detail/computer-software/n6854a-geolocation-server-and-n6841a-rf-sensor-software-sw319.html)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
