Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4203](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4203) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A timing\\-based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4304) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer, then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial\\-of\\-service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4450) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.4\n [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i\\_PKCS7(), d2i\\_PKCS7\\_bio() or d2i\\_PKCS7\\_fp() functions.

This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service attack.

In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library, but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third\\-party applications would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-0401](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0401) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service. An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers \\- sub\\-identifiers \\- most of which have no size limit. OBJ\\_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1\\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub\\-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods. When one of the sub\\-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.\n   \n\n  \n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-2650](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2650) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens recommends updating the SCALANCE products to\n [v4\\.5](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109825818/) \n or later version.\n \n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n\n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-699386 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-699386.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-699386.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n .
