EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Atlas Copco* **Equipment:**  Power Focus 6000* **Vulnerabilities:**  Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, Small Space of Random Values, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a loss of sensitive information and the takeover of a user\u2019s active session.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Power Focus 6000, a smart connected assembly product, are affected:* Power Focus 6000: All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-312](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)** Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 web server does not sanitize the login information stored by the authenticated user\u2019s browser, which could allow an attacker with access to the user\u2019s computer to gain credential information of the controller.[CVE\\-2023\\-1897](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1897)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [SMALL SPACE OF RANDOM VALUES CWE\\-334](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/334.html)** Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 web server uses a small amount of session Id numbers. An attacker could enter a session Id number to retrieve data for an active user\u2019s session.[CVE\\-2023\\-1898](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1898)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** Atlas Copco Power Focus 6000 web server is not a secure connection by default, which could allow an attacker to gain sensitive information by monitoring network traffic between user and controller.[CVE\\-2023\\-1899](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1899)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Sweden### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Chen Porian of OTORIO reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Atlas Copco has not responded to requests to work with CISA on mitigations for the reported vulnerabilities. Users of the affected products are encouraged to [contact Atlas Copco](https://www.atlascopco.com/en-us/itba/us-contact)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.
