EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SINEMA Remote Connect Server* **Vulnerabilities:**  Incorrect Authorization2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow authenticated unprivileged user accounts to access unauthorized functionality.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SINEMA Remote Connect Server are affected:* SINEMA Remote Connect Server: All versions prior to v3\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html) The webserver could allow unauthorized actions via special URLs for unprivileged users. The settings of the Unified Management Component (UMC) authorization server could be changed to add a rogue server by an attacker authenticating with unprivileged user rights.[CVE\\-2020\\-25239](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25239)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html) Unprivileged users can access services when guessing the URL. An attacker could impact availability, integrity, and gain information from logs and templates of the service.[CVE\\-2020\\-25240](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25240)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to [v3\\.0 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793790)  and has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce risk:* Check that all settings are as expected when applying templates.* Configure a syslog server for logs.* Ensure all accounts (including unprivileged) are trusted. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information refer to Siemens security advisory [SSA\\-731317](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-731317.pdf)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
