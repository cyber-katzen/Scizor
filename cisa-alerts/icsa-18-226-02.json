This \u201cerror state\u201d mechanism does not work correctly if SSL\\_read() or SSL\\_write() is called directly by an application. This could result in data being sent out unencrypted by the SSL/TLS record layer. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to cause a fatal error in the targeted SSL/TLS handshake algorithm, and that the targeted application calls SSL\\_read() or SSL\\_write() only after receiving the fatal error. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit this security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow a compromise of data confidentiality by transmitting it unencrypted over the network.[CVE\\-2017\\-3737](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-3737)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS**  : Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED**  : Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION**  : Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.5\\.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: [https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  ), following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:<https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory SSA\\-179516 on their website:<https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.
