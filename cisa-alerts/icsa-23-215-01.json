EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\u200bCVSS v3 5.9\n\u200bATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\n\u200bVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\n\u200bEquipment: GOT2000 Series and GOT SIMPLE Series\n\u200bVulnerability: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\n\u200bSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack data connections or prevent legitimate users from establishing data connections.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\u200bMitsubishi Electric reports this vulnerability affects the following HMIs when using the \u201cFTP server\u201d function:\n\n\u200bGOT2000 Series, GT21 model: versions 01.49.000 and prior\n\u200bGOT SIMPLE, GS21 model: versions 01.49.000 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 \u200bPREDICTABLE EXACT VALUE FROM PREVIOUS VALUES CWE-342\n\u200bA denial-of-service and spoofing (session hijacking of data connections) vulnerability exists in the FTP server function on GOT2000 series and GOT SIMPLE series because the port number of a data connection can be easily guessed due to predictable exact value from previous values.\n\u200bCVE-2023-3373 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\u200bCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\n\u200bCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u200bCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\n\u200bMitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4.
