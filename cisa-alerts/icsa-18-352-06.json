EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable from an adjacent network/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ABB\nEquipment: CMS-770\nVulnerabilities: Improper Authentication\n\n2.\u00a0RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read sensitive configuration files that may lead to code execution on the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CMS-770, from ABB and Busch-Jaeger brands, are affected:\n\nCMS-770: Software Versions 1.7.1 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nAn attacker can read sensitive configuration files by bypassing the user authentication mechanism.\nCVE-2018-17928 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMaxim Rupp (RuppIT) working with ABB reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB recommends installing the device in accordance with the latest instructions from the updated technical manual. For additional information, refer to ABB\u2019s security notification ABBVU-EPBP-R-5673 and the product user manual.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
