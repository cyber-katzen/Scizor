RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to use a session token that has not been cleared upon log out of an authenticated user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nJohnson Controls reports this vulnerability affects the following Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers for building management systems:\n\nAll Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers: Versions 10 and 11\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCOMPLETE CLEANUP CWE-459\nUnder certain circumstances the session token is not cleared upon log out.\nCVE-2021-36205 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc. reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users update the following:\n\nUpdate all Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers: Versions 10 with patch 10.1.5\nUpdate all Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers: Versions 11 with patch 11.0.2\n\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2022-06 v1\nJohnson Controls recommends taking steps to minimize risks to all building automation systems.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
