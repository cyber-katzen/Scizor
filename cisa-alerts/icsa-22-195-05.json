RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with administrative privileges to gain root access.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROXMX5000RE: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536: All versions prior to 2.15.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000: \u00a0All versions prior to 2.15.1\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nAffected devices do not properly validate user input, making them susceptible to command injection. An attacker with access to either the shell or the web CLI with administrator privileges could access the underlying operating system as the root user.\nCVE-2022-29560 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner of Siemens Energy reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating RUGGEDCOM ROX devices to the latest version:\n\nRUGGEDCOM ROX MX and RX family devices: Update to v2.15.1 or later\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations customers can apply to reduce risk:\n\nApply the principle of least privileges for accounts configured on the affected devices.\nApply defense-in-depth practices to the SSH, Web and NETCONF services on ROX.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-599506\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
