MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users take the following measures to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities:\n\nDisable the webserver during normal use. The webserver is disabled by default and should only be enabled to modify configurations. After modifying configurations, the web server should be disabled.\nFor information on how to mitigate security risks on industrial automation control systems (IACS) networks see the following publications:\n\n\u00a0System Security Design Guidelines Reference Manual publication, SECURE-RM001\nConfigure System Security Features User Manual, SECURE-UM001\n\n\nAdditionally, Rockwell Automation encourages customers to implement their suggested Security Best Practices to minimize the risk of the vulnerabilities.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
