EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Delta Electronics\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0DIAScreen\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Out-of-bounds Write\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DIAScreen, a software configuration tool for Delta devices, are affected:\u00a0\n\nDIAScreen: versions 1.2.1.23 and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\u00a0\nDelta Electronics DIAScreen versions 1.2.1.23 and prior are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0250\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\u00a0\nDelta Electronics DIAScreen versions 1.2.1.23 and prior are vulnerable to a buffer overflow through improper restrictions of operations within memory, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0251\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nDelta Electronics DIAScreen versions 1.2.1.23 and prior are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0249\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson) and YuLin Sung, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics released\u00a0version 1.3.0 of DIAScreen\u00a0(login required) and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely. \u00a0\n",
