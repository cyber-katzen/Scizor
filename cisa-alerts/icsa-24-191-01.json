EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.4\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: CNCSoft-G2\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Write, Out-of-bounds Read, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a buffer overflow condition and allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2, a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software, are affected:\n\nCNCSoft-G2: Version 2.0.0.5\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nDelta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. If a target visits a malicious page or opens a malicious file an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2024-39880 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39880. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nDelta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. If a target visits a malicious page or opens a malicious file an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2024-39881 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39881. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nDelta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. If a target visits a malicious page or opens a malicious file an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2024-39882 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39882. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.4 HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nDelta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. If a target visits a malicious page or opens a malicious file an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2024-39883 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-39883. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nBobby Gould, Fritz Sands, and Natnael Samson working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends users update to CNCSoft-G2 V2.1.0.10 or later.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJuly 09, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
