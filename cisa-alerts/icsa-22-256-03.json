EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/Low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Delta Electronics\nEquipment:\u00a0DIAEnergie\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n\n2. UPDATE OR REPOSTED INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled \u201cICSA-22-256-03 Delta Industrial Automation DIAEnergie\u201d that was published September 19, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\nDelta Electronics reports this vulnerability affects the following versions of DIAEnergie, an industrial energy management system:\n\nDIAEnergie: versions prior to 1.9.03.009\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nExecutable files could be uploaded to certain directories using hard-coded bearer authorization, allowing remote code execution.\nCVE-2022-3214\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nY4er working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nDelta Electronics fixed the reported vulnerability in version 1.9.03.009 and recommends all users update affected systems. Users can\u00a0contact the front end sales or FAEs\u00a0to get this version.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
