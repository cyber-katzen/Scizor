[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric Wonderware ArchestrA Logger============================================== Last Revised July 06, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-187\\-04### **CVSS v3 9\\.8****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Schneider Electric**Equipment:**  Wonderware ArchestrA Logger**Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-Based Buffer Overflow, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Null Pointer DeferenceAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Schneider Electric reports that the following versions of Wonderware ArchestrA Logger, a logging software, are affected:* Wonderware ArchestrA Logger, versions 2017\\.426\\.2307\\.1 and prior.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute code or cause a denial of service.MITIGATION---------- Schneider Electric recommends that users of any Wonderware, Avantis, SimSci, or Skelta product that installs the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger version 2017\\.426\\.2307\\.1 or prior should apply the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger Security Patch v2017\\.517\\.2328\\.1 as soon as possible. Software updates can be downloaded from the Global Customer Support \u201cSoftware Download\u201d area or from the links below:* Wonderware ArchestrA Logger Security Patch v2017\\.517\\.2328\\.1 (requires login):\t+ [https://gcsresource.invensys.com/tracking/ConfirmDownload.aspx?id\\=22429](https://gcsresource.invensys.com/tracking/ConfirmDownload.aspx?id=22429) For more information about this vulnerability and patch, please refer to Schneider Electric Security Bulletin LFSec00000116, which is available at the following location:[http://software.schneider\\-electric.com/pdf/security\\-bulletin/lfsec00000116/](http://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000116/)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a highly privileged account.[CVE\\-2017\\-9629](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9629)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. Schneider Electric has assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 to this vulnerability; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).[UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability could allow an attacker to exhaust the memory resources of the machine, causing a denial of service.[CVE\\-2017\\-9627](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9627)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. Schneider Electric has assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 to this vulnerability; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).[NULL POINTER DEFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The null pointer deference vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the logger process, causing a denial of service for logging and log\\-viewing. Schneider Electric notes that applications which use the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger continue to run when the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger service is unavailable.[CVE\\-2017\\-9631](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9631)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. Schneider Electric has assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 to this vulnerability; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).RESEARCHER---------- Andrey Zhukov of USSC discovered this vulnerability and reported it to Schneider Electric.
