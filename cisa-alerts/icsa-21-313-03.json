MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for several of the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not available. Siemens has not identified any additional specific workarounds or mitigations.\n\nCapital VSTAR: Contact Siemens Customer Support to receive patch and update information.\nNucleus NET: Update to the latest version of Nucleus ReadyStart v3 or v4. Contact Siemens Customer Support or a Nucleus sales team for mitigation advice.\nNucleus ReadyStart v3: Update to v2017.02.4 or later version.\nNucleus ReadyStart v4: Update to v4.1.1 or later version.\nNucleus Source Code: Contact Siemens Customer Support to receive patch and update information.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-044112\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
