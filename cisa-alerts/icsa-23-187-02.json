EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: ABUS\nEquipment: ABUS Security Camera\nVulnerability: Command injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow arbitrary file reads or remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ABUS TVIP, an indoor security camera, are affected:\u00a0\n\nABUS TVIP: 20000-21150\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\nABUS TVIP 20000-21150 devices allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in the /cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft ap field.\nCVE-2023-26609 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Comercial Facilities\n\n\n\n\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\n\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThe Chaos Computer Club (CCC) reported this vulnerability to ABUS.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nIn 2019, ABUS conducted a replacement campaign to encourage users to replace the affected devices with newer models such as TVIP82561.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nPublic exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has low attack complexity.\n",
