[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryDelta Electronics WPLSoft, ISPSoft, and PMSoft Vulnerabilities============================================================== Last Revised December 13, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-348\\-03OVERVIEW-------- Researchers axt and Ariele Caltabiano each working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) have identified vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics\u2019 WPLSoft, ISPSoft, and PMSoft software applications. Delta Electronics has produced new software versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Delta Electronics products and versions are affected:* WPLSoft, Versions prior to V2\\.42\\.11,* ISPSoft, Versions prior to 3\\.02\\.11, and* PMSoft, Versions prior to2\\.10\\.10IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Delta Electronics is a Taiwan\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India, Brazil, and the US. The affected products, WPLSoft, ISPSoft, and PMSoft, are platforms for editing the control software of Delta DVP series motion controlling programmable logic controllers (PLCs). According to Delta Electronics, these platforms are used to prepare process control systems (PCSs) for deployment across a variety of industrial automation environments within the Critical Manufacturing Sector. Delta Electronics estimates that these products are used primarily in ASIA and Europe with a small percentage in the US.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-122: Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122\\.html, web site last accessed December 13, 2016\\. There are multiple instances of heap\\-based buffer overflows that may allow malicious files to cause the execution of arbitrary code or a denial of service. CVE\\-2016\\-5805NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-5805, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 13, 2016\\.### OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITECWE\\-787: Out\\-of\\-Bounds Write, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787\\.html, web site last accessed December 13, 2016\\. Multiple instances of out\\-of\\-bounds conditions may allow malicious files to be read and executed by the affected software. CVE\\-2016\\-5802NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-5802, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 13, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. These exploits are triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads malformed files with .dvp or other extensions.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities in these products.#### DIFFICULTY Crafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.MITIGATION---------- Delta Electronics recommends affected users update their software to the latest versions ISPSoft V3\\.02\\.11, PMSoft V2\\.10\\.10, and WPLSoft V2\\.42\\.11 that are available through the following links:* ISPSoft V3\\.02\\.11[http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA\\_IA\\-PLC\\_ISPSoft\\-V3\\-02\\-11\\_SW\\_20161115\\.zip](http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA_IA-PLC_ISPSoft-V3-02-11_SW_20161115.zip) * PMSoft V2\\.10\\.10[http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA\\_IA\\-PLC\\_PMSoft\\-V2\\-10\\-10\\_SW\\_20161115\\.zip](http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA_IA-PLC_PMSoft-V2-10-10_SW_20161115.zip) * WPLSoft V2\\.42\\.11[http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA\\_IA\\-PLC\\_WPLSoft\\-V2\\-42\\-11\\_SW\\_20161115\\.zip](http://www.deltaww.com/filecenter/Products/download/06/060301/Software/DELTA_IA-PLC_WPLSoft-V2-42-11_SW_20161115.zip)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  .
