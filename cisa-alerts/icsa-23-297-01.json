EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/known public exploitation\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: Stratix 5800 and Stratix 5200\nVulnerabilities: Unprotected Alternate Channel, OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take control of the affected system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Stratix products and the contained Cisco IOS software are affected:\n\nStratix 5800 (running Cisco IOS XE Software with the Web UI feature enabled): All versions\nStratix 5200 (running Cisco IOS XE Software with the Web UI feature enabled): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0UNPROTECTED ALTERNATE CHANNEL CWE-420\nRockwell Automation is aware of active exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability in the web user interface feature of Cisco IOS XE Software when exposed to the internet or to untrusted networks. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated threat actor to create an account on a vulnerable system with privilege level 15 access. The threat actor could then potentially use that account to gain control of the affected system.\nCVE-2023-20198\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nRockwell Automation is aware of active exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability in the Web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software when exposed to the internet or to untrusted networks. This vulnerability could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands with the privileges of root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands to the underlying operating system with root privileges.\nCVE-2023-20273\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United states\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation strongly encourages users to follow guidance disabling Stratix HTTP servers on all internet-facing systems.\n\nTo disable the HTTP Server feature, use the no ip http server or no ip http secure-server command in global configuration mode. If both the HTTP server and HTTPS server are in use, both commands are required to disable the HTTP Server feature.\nCisco Talos has provided Indicators of Compromise and Snort rules that can be found\u00a0here.\nAccess Control Lists should be enabled to only allow specific IP addresses to access the Web UI of the device. Detailed instructions on how to create the Access Control List is in\u00a0QA67053. (Login required)\nWhen implementing access controls for these services, be sure to review the controls because there is the potential for an interruption in production services.\n\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation's\u00a0Security Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u00a0These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5.
