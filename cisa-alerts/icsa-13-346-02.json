Cooper Power Systems has discontinued the OPC server and recommends that customers use the SMP Gateway as a replacement that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Cybectec product is affected:\n\nDNP3 Master OPC Server, all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to affect the availability of the DNP3 Master OPC Server software.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nCybectec is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States and Canada.\nThe affected product, DNP3 Master OPC Server, supports the DNP3 outstation. According to Cybectec, OPC servers are deployed across the energy sector. Cybectec estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Latin America.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed December\u00a0 12, 2013.\n\nThe DNP3 component in Cooper Power Systems Cybectec DNP3 Master OPC Server incorrectly validates input. An attacker could introduce an unhandled exception, causing the process to crash.\nCVE-2013-2814NVD, http://Web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2814, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed December\u00a0 12, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nCooper Power Systems has discontinued the OPC server and recommends that customers use the SMP Gateway product as a replacement that mitigates this vulnerability. For additional information, please contact a customer support representative at eassupport@cooperindustries.com.\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed December\u00a0 12, 2013. NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed December 12, 2013. that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
