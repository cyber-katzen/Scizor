EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: MachineSense LLC.\nEquipment: MachineSense FeverWarn\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Improper Access Control, OS Command Injection, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain user data from devices, execute remote code on devices, or gain control over devices to perform malicious actions.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components of the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system, are affected:\n\nFeverWarn: ESP32\nFeverWarn: RaspberryPi\nFeverWarn: DataHub RaspberryPi\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Missing Authentication for Critical Function CWE-306\nThe cloud provider MachineSense uses for integration and deployment for multiple MachineSense devices, such as the programmable logic controller (PLC), PumpSense, PowerAnalyzer, FeverWarn, and others is insufficiently protected against unauthorized access. An attacker with access to the internal procedures could view source code, secret credentials, and more.\nCVE-2023-6221\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0Use of Hard-coded Credentials CWE-798\nMultiple MachineSense devices have credentials unable to be changed by the user or administrator.\nCVE-2023-46706\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0Missing Authentication for Critical Function CWE-306\nThe MachineSense application programmable interface (API) is improperly protected and can be accessed without authentication. A remote attacker could retrieve and modify sensitive information without any authentication.\nCVE-2023-49617\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0Missing Authentication for Critical Function CWE-306\nMachineSense devices use unauthenticated MQTT messaging to monitor devices and remote viewing of sensor data by users.\nCVE-2023-49115\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0Improper Access Control CWE-284\nMachineSense FeverWarn devices are configured as Wi-Fi hosts in a way that attackers within range could connect to the device's web services and compromise the device.\nCVE-2023-47867\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0Improper Input Validation CWE-20\nMachineSense FeverWarn Raspberry Pi-based devices lack input sanitization, which could allow an attacker on an adjacent network to send a message running commands or could overflow the stack.\nCVE-2023-49610\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Healthcare and Public Health Sector\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVera Mens of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFeverWarn and the associated cloud service were pandemic-specific products for elevated body temperature scanning, discontinued by MachineSense prior to the end of the pandemic. They are no longer available, and there will be no future availability or upgrades. MachineSense is not aware of any current users of FeverWarn. Users of the affected product are encouraged to\u00a0contact MachineSense\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
