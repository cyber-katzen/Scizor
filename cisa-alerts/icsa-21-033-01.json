UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-033-01 Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 that was published February 2, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial-of-service condition.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports the vulnerability affects the following MicroLogix 1400 controllers:\n\nMicroLogix 1400, All series Version 21.6 and below\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-120\nA remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.\nCVE-2021-22659 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\nParul Sindhwad and Dr. Faruk Kazi of COE-CNDS, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), India reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n5. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users with the affected controller to mitigate risk. They encourage, when possible, to combine this guidance with the general security guidelines for a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy. Please subscribe to updates to this advisory and the Industrial Security Advisory Index to stay notified.\nAll users, if applicable, may disable Modbus TCP support if it is not necessary for their MicroLogix 1400 implementation. Without Modbus TCP enabled, a potential attacker does not have access to exploit the device using this vulnerability.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor additional information see Rockwell Automation Security Advisory PN1545.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nRockwell Automation recommends the following network-based vulnerability mitigations for embedded products:\n\nUtilize proper network infrastructure controls (such as firewalls) to help ensure Modbus TCP from unauthorized sources are blocked.\nConsult the product documentation for specific features (such as a hardware keyswitch setting), which may be used to block unauthorized changes, etc.\nBlock all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port 2222 and 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270.\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following software/PC-based mitigation strategies:\n\nRun all software as a User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.\nUse of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list application can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at Knowledgebase Article ID 546989.\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum of rights as needed.\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following general mitigations:\n\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs, and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article ID 494865.\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), and recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
