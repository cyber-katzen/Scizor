Emerson has tested the new library to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products use the vulnerable HART DTM library and are affected:\n\nFisher Controls DVC6000 Digital Valve Controller Rev. 2.01,\nFisher Controls International DVC2000 Digital Valve Controller Rev. 1.01,\nMicro Motion 1500 Rev. 5 and 6,\nMicro Motion 1700 Analog Rev. 5 and 6,\nMicro Motion 1700 IS Rev. 6,\nMicro Motion 1700 Rev. 5,\nMicro Motion 1700IS Rev. 5,\nMicro Motion 2000 Config I/O Rev. 5,\nMicro Motion 2200S Rev. 1,\nMicro Motion 2400S Analog Rev. 2, 3, and 4,\nMicro Motion 2500/2700 Config I/O Rev. 5 and 6,\nMicro Motion 2700 Analog Rev. 5 and 6,\nMicro Motion 2700 IS Rev. 5 and 6,\nMicro Motion RFT9739 Rev. 4,\nMicro Motion Series 3000 Rev. 7,\nRosemount 1151 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 5 and 6,\nRosemount 2051 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 3, 9, and 10,\nRosemount 2088 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 3, 9, and 10,\nRosemount 2090 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 3,\nRosemount 248 Temperature Transmitter Rev. 2,\nRosemount 3051 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 3, 7, 9, and 10,\nRosemount 3051S Advanced Diagnostics Rev. 2 and 3,\nRosemount 3051S Electronic Remote Sensors Rev. 1,\nRosemount 3051S Pressure Transmitter Rev. 7,\nRosemount 3051SMV Direct Process Variable Rev. 1,\nRosemount 3051SMV MultiVariable Mass Energy Flow Rev. 1,\nRosemount 3095M MultiVariable\u2122 Mass Flow Rev. 2,\nRosemount 3100 Ultrasonic Level Transmitter Rev. 5,\nRosemount 3144P Temperature Transmitter Rev. 3, 4, 5, and 6\nRosemount 3300 Radar Level and Interface Transmitter Rev. 3,\nRosemount 333 Triloop Rev. 1,\nRosemount 4500 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 7,\nRosemount 4600 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 1,\nRosemount 5300 Radar Level and Interface Transmitter Rev. 1, 2, and 3,\nRosemount 5400 Radar Level Transmitter Rev. 1 and 2,\nRosemount 644 Temperature Transmitter Rev. 6, 7, 8, and 9,\nRosemount 8712D Magnetic Flowmeter Rev. 1,\nRosemount 8712E Magnetic Flowmeter Rev. 3,\nRosemount 8712H Magnetic Flowmeter Rev. 1,\nRosemount 8732C Magnetic Flowmeter Rev. 7,\nRosemount 8732E Magnetic Flowmeter Rev. 2,\nRosemount 8800C Vortex Flowmeter Rev. 3,\nRosemount 8800D Vortex Flowmeter Rev. 1 and 2,\nRosemount Analytical 1056 Rev. 1 and 2,\nRosemount Analytical 5081A Rev. 2,\nRosemount Analytical 5081CT Rev. 1,\nRosemount Analytical 5081p Rev. 2,\nRosemount Analytical 54eA Rev. 2,\nRosemount Analytical 54eC Rev. 1,\nRosemount Analytical 54epH Rev. 2,\nRosemount Analytical OCT4000 Rev. 3,\nRosemount Analytical OCX8800 Rev. 3,\nRosemount Analytical XmtA Rev. 1,\nRosemount Analytical XmtCT Rev. 1,\nRosemount Analytical XmtpH Rev. 1,\nRosemount Metran 150 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 9 and 10, and\nRosemount Metran 75 Pressure Transmitter Rev. 9 and 10.\n\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerability causes the HART DTM component to crash and also causes the HART service to stop responding. No loss of information or loss of control or view by the control system results from an attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nEmerson Process Management is a global manufacturing and technology company offering multiple products and services in the industrial, commercial, and consumer markets through its network power, process management, industrial automation, climate technologies, and tools and storage businesses.\nThe affected products are HART-based field devices. According to Emerson, these products are deployed across multiple critical infrastructure sectors. Emerson estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed January 08, 2014.\n\nBy sending specially crafted response packets directly on the 4-20 mA current loop, the DTM component stops functioning and Field Device Tool (FDT) Frame application becomes unresponsive. A manipulated HART device and physical network access is required to exploit this vulnerability\nCVE-2014-9191NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9191, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 1.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, web site last accessed January 08, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nPhysical network access is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Physical access to the 4 mA to 20 mA current loop is required in conjunction with a connected HART device modified to send crafted packets. The exploit also requires specific timing for the spoofed response. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nEmerson updated the HART DTM for the Rosemount 644 Temperature Transmitter Rev. 8, DTM Version 1.4.181 on November 17, 2014. Installing this DTM will resolve the vulnerability for all the impacted Emerson products listed above. Emerson recommends downloading the updated DTM from its web site:\nhttp://www2.emersonprocess.com/en-US/documentation/deviceinstallkits/Pages/deviceinstallkitsearch.aspx\nAn attacker would require physical access to the HART loop in order to execute this attack. The vulnerability is exploited by connecting a rogue device to the HART loop and sending malformed data to the frame. If the end user has adequate physical protection of the HART loop in place, exploitation is not possible. Field devices and WirelessHART installations are unaffected. Emerson recommends having physical protection of the end users\u2019 entire infrastructure.\nMore details can be found at Emerson\u2019s advisory located:\nhttp://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM Central Web Documents/EMR EPM14001-1.pdf\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nProvide physical protection to system controls, connections, and cabling.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
