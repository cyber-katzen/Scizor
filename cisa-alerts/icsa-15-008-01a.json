No loss of information or loss of control or view by the control system results from an attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Emerson Process Management is a global manufacturing and technology company offering multiple products and services in the industrial, commercial, and consumer markets through its network power, process management, industrial automation, climate technologies, and tools and storage businesses. The affected products are HART\\-based field devices. According to Emerson, these products are deployed across multiple critical infrastructure sectors. Emerson estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE\\-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\\.html, web site last accessed January 08, 2014\\. By sending specially crafted response packets directly on the 4\\-20 mA current loop, the DTM component stops functioning and Field Device Tool (FDT) Frame application becomes unresponsive. A manipulated HART device and physical network access is required to exploit this vulnerability CVE\\-2014\\-9191NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-9191, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 1\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, web site last accessed January 08, 2014\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY Physical network access is required to exploit this vulnerability.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**#### DIFFICULTY Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Physical access to the 4 mA to 20 mA current loop is required in conjunction with a connected HART device modified to send crafted packets. The exploit also requires specific timing for the spoofed response. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.MITIGATION---------- Emerson updated the HART DTM for the Rosemount 644 Temperature Transmitter Rev. 8, DTM Version 1\\.4\\.181 on November 17, 2014\\. Installing this DTM will resolve the vulnerability for all the impacted Emerson products listed above. Emerson recommends downloading the updated DTM from its web site:[http://www2\\.emersonprocess.com/en\\-US/documentation/deviceinstallkits/Pages/deviceinstallkitsearch.aspx](http://www2.emersonprocess.com/en-US/documentation/deviceinstallkits/Pages/deviceinstallkitsearch.aspx)  An attacker would require physical access to the HART loop in order to execute this attack. The vulnerability is exploited by connecting a rogue device to the HART loop and sending malformed data to the frame. If the end user has adequate physical protection of the HART loop in place, exploitation is not possible. Field devices and WirelessHART installations are unaffected. Emerson recommends having physical protection of the end users\u2019 entire infrastructure. More details can be found at Emerson\u2019s advisory located:[http://www2\\.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM Central Web Documents/EMR EPM14001\\-1\\.pdf](http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM%20Central%20Web%20Documents/EMR%20EPM14001-1.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Provide physical protection to system controls, connections, and cabling.
