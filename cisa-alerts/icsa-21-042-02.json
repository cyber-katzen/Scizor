RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in privilege escalation and total loss of device confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports the vulnerability affects the following products:\u00a0\n\nDriveTools SP v5.13 and below\u00a0\n\nDriveExecutive v5.13 and below\u00a0\n\n\nDrives AOP v4.12 and below (supports Logix Versions v16-v30)\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nDriveTools and Drives AOP both contain a vulnerability that a local attacker with limited privileges may be able to exploit resulting in privilege escalation and complete control of the system.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-22665 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nClaroty and Cognite reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users apply the latest update:\u00a0\n\nDriveTools SP v5.14.41 or later\nDrives AOP v4.13.41 or later\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following software/PC-based mitigation strategies when running the affected products on a PC:\n\nRun all software as user, not as an administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.\nUse of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list application can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at Knowledgebase Article ID 546989\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following general mitigations:\n\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article ID PN715\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nPlease see more information on this issue in the Rockwell Automation industrial security advisory titled Writable Path Directory in DriveTools SP and Drives AOP.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
