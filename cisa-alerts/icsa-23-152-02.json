EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  HID Global* **Equipment:**  SAFE* **Vulnerabilities:**  Modification of Assumed\\-Immutable Data2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in exposure of personal data or create a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of HID\u2019s SAFE, a personnel and access management software, are affected:* HID SAFE using the optional External Visitor Manager portal: Versions 5\\.8\\.0 through 5\\.11\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [MODIFICATION OF ASSUMED\\-IMMUTABLE DATA CWE\\-471](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html)** The External Visitor Manager portal of HID\u2019s SAFE versions 5\\.8\\.0 through 5\\.11\\.3 are vulnerable to manipulation within web fields in the application programmable interface (API). An attacker could log in using account credentials available through a request generated by an internal user and then manipulate the visitor\\-id within the web API to access the personal data of other users. There is no limit on the number of requests that can be made to the HID SAFE Web Server, so an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to create a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2023\\-2904](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2904)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Government Facilities, Transportation, Commercial Facilities, Healthcare* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER CISA internal research reported this vulnerability to HID.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- The External Visitor Management feature is licensed and deployed separately from the HID SAFE core software. Users not using this feature are not affected.
