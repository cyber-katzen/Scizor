MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version the COMOS product:* Update to [V10\\.4\\.4](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109824522/)  or later version.* For CVE\\-2023\\-43503, update the COMOS database to version 25\\. (See \"Data maintenance: Modifying the version\" in the user manual. Warning: After the update, the database cannot be used by older COMOS versions).* For CVE\\-2023\\-43504, delete ptmcast.exe from bin folder of COMOS installation directory. Installations from COMOS V10\\.4\\.4 or later version does not contain ptmcast.exe. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* For CVE\\-2023\\-43505 and CVE\\-2023\\-46601, use an application server like Citrix which builds an additional layer of access control around COMOS. The file share with the documents folder and the database should be only accessible by the application server. You can find further recommendations in the COMOS manual \"Security relevant configuration\" in COMOS [documentation](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109823629/)  .* Ensure all files imported into COMOS originate from a trusted source and transmitted are over secure channels. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-137900 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-137900.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-137900.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
