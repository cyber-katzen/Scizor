Advantech has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Zhou Yu has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAdvantech reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of WebAccess:\n\nWebAccess versions prior to 8.1_20160519\n\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerabilities could allow an attacker who successfully exploits them to insert and run arbitrary code on an affected system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdvantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface (HMI) product. According to Advantech, WebAccess is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Government Facilities. Advantech estimates that this product is used globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNSAFE ACTIVEX CONTROL MARKED SAFE-FOR-SCRIPTINGCWE-623: Unsafe ActiveX Control Marked Safe For Scripting, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/623.html, web site last accessed June 21, 2016.\n\nSeveral ActiveX controls are intended for restricted use, but have been marked as safe-for-scripting.\nCVE-2016-4525NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4525, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed July 14, 2016.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, which in certain scenarios can cause it to load a DLL file from an untrusted source.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept a malformed DLL file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nAdvantech has released a new version of WebAccess, Version 8.1_20160519, to address the reported vulnerabilities. This new version is available on the Advantech web site at the following location:\nhttp://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks. Specifically, users should:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed June 21, 2016. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed June 21, 2016. for more information on social engineering attacks.\nDo not visit untrusted web sites.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
