EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Opcenter Execution Core\n\n--------- Begin Update B\u00a0Part 1 of 5 ---------\n\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Improper Access Control, Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 5 ---------\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-196-07 Siemens Opcenter Execution Core (Update A) that was published August 11, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 5 ---------\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to obtain session cookies, read and modify application data, read internal information, perform unauthorized changes, and obtain passwords of currently logged in users. Should the attacker gain access to the session cookies, they could then hijack the session and perform arbitrary actions in the name of the victim.\n--------- End Update B Part 2\u00a0of 5 ---------\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products are affected:\n--------- Begin Update B Part 3\u00a0of 5 ---------\n\nCamstar Enterprise Platform: All versions. Only affected by CVE-2020-7576, CVE-2020-7577, CVE-2020-7578\nOpcenter Execution Core: All versions prior to v8.2. \u00a0Affected by CVE-2020-7576, CVE-2020-7577, CVE-2020-7578\nOpcenter Execution Core: Version 8.2.
