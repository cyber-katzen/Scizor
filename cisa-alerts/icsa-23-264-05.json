If exploited, a remote threat actor could potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\nCVE-2020-16017\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nConnected Components Workbench utilizes CefSharp version 81.3.100 that contains a use after free vulnerability in Animation within Google Chrome before 98.0.4758.102. This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote threat actor to exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\nCVE-2022-0609\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nConnected Components Workbench utilizes CefSharp version 81.3.100 that contains an inappropriate implementation in V8 of Google Chrome before 86.0.4240.18. This vulnerability allows a remote threat actor to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\nCVE-2020-16009\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nConnected Components Workbench utilizes CefSharp version 81.3.100 that contains an inappropriate implementation in V8 of Google Chrome before 86.0.4240.198. This vulnerability allows a remote threat actor to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\nCVE-2020-16013\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nConnected Components Workbench utilizes CefSharp version 81.3.100 that contains a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Freetype within Google Chrome before 86.0.4240.111. This vulnerability could allow a remote threat actor to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\nCVE-2020-15999\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users to update to\u00a0R21 and later.\nUsers with the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations, if possible.\nAdditionally, Rockwell Automation encourages users to implement their suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability.\n\nSecurity Best Practices\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n5.
