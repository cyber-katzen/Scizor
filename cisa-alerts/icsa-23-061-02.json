EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Baicells\u00a0\nEquipment: Nova 436Q, Nova 430E, Nova 430I, and Neutrino 430\u00a0\nVulnerability: Command injection\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow commands performed using pre-login execution and with root permissions.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nBaicells reports this vulnerability affects the following LTE TDD eNodeB devices with firmware versions through QRTB 2.12.7: \u00a0\n\nNova 436Q\u00a0\nNova 430E\u00a0\nNova 430I\u00a0\nNeutrino 430\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\u00a0\nBaicells Nova 436Q, Nova 430E, Nova 430I, and Neutrino 430 LTE TDD eNodeB devices with firmware versions through QRTB 2.12.7 are vulnerable to remote shell code exploitation via HTTP command injections. Commands are performed using pre-login execution and with root permissions.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0776 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRustam Amin reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nBaicells has resolved this vulnerability in software version QRTB 2.12.8 and later. Baicells recommends all users currently running an earlier version of QRTB firmware upgrade affected products to the 2.12.8 firmware version. Firmware can be downloaded from the Baicells community page or upgraded via OMC.\u00a0\nBaicells published a security vulnerability notice for this issue.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\u00a0\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\u00a0\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\u00a0\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\u00a0\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
