EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Location Intelligence Perpetual Large, Location Intelligence Perpetual Medium, Location Intelligence Perpetual Non-Prod, Location Intelligence Perpetual Small, Location Intelligence SUS Large, Location Intelligence SUS Medium, Location Intelligence SUS Non-Prod, Location Intelligence SUS Small\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain full administrative access to the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nLocation Intelligence Perpetual Large (9DE5110-8CA13-1AX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence Perpetual Medium (9DE5110-8CA12-1AX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence Perpetual Non-Prod (9DE5110-8CA10-1AX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence Perpetual Small (9DE5110-8CA11-1AX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence SUS Large (9DE5110-8CA13-1BX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence SUS Medium (9DE5110-8CA12-1BX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence SUS Non-Prod (9DE5110-8CA10-1BX0): All versions prior to V4.3\nLocation Intelligence SUS Small (9DE5110-8CA11-1BX0): All versions prior to V4.3\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nAffected products use a hard-coded secret value for the computation of a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain full administrative access to the application.\nCVE-2024-23816\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-23816. A base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nLocation Intelligence Perpetual Large (9DE5110-8CA13-1AX0), Location Intelligence Perpetual Medium (9DE5110-8CA12-1AX0), Location Intelligence Perpetual Non-Prod (9DE5110-8CA10-1AX0), Location Intelligence Perpetual Small (9DE5110-8CA11-1AX0), Location Intelligence SUS Large (9DE5110-8CA13-1BX0), Location Intelligence SUS Medium (9DE5110-8CA12-1BX0), Location Intelligence SUS Non-Prod (9DE5110-8CA10-1BX0), Location Intelligence SUS Small (9DE5110-8CA11-1BX0): Update to V4.3 or later version. The update is available from Siemens Online Software Delivery (OSD).\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-580228 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
