EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 6\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low Attack Complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : Siveillance Control* **Vulnerability**  : Incorrect Authorization2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a local attacker to gain write privileges for objects where they only have read privileges.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* Siveillance Control: Versions V2\\.8 and after until V3\\.1\\.1### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html)** The affected product does not properly check the list of access groups that are assigned to an individual user. This could enable a locally logged on user to gain write privileges for objects where they only have read privileges.[CVE\\-2023\\-45793](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-45793)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ). A CVSS v4 score has been calculated for [CVE\\-2023\\-45793](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-45793)  . A base score of 6\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:4\\.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released a new version for Siveillance Control and recommends users update to the latest version:* Update to [V3\\.1\\.1 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109827073/)* Restrict access to the machine where the Siveillance Control frontend is installed As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-145196 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-145196.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-145196.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.5\\.
