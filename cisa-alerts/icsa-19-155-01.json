This could allow an attacker to decrypt passwords even if encrypted with another security policy such as Basic256Sha256\\.[CVE\\-2018\\-7559](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7559)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate SD card data, which could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication of the device. This device is designed for use in a protected industrial environment with restricted physical access.[CVE\\-2019\\-10998](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10998)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [CHANNEL ACCESSIBLE BY NON\\-ENDPOINT ('MAN\\-IN\\-THE\\-MIDDLE') CWE\\-300](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html) An attacker trying to connect to the device using a man\\-in\\-the\\-middle setup may crash the PLC service, resulting in a denial of service condition. The device must then be rebooted, or the PLC service must be restarted manually via Linux shell.[CVE\\-2019\\-10997](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10997)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USING COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES This product uses older versions of several open\\-source software components containing vulnerabilities that may affect availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the AXC F 2152\\.

Specifically, users should:* Ensure the product is in a physically secure area.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
