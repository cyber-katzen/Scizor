See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/enterprise/) \n for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.* \n\n\n\n\n The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are engaged in addressing a spearphishing campaign targeting government organizations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non\\-governmental organizations (NGOs). A sophisticated cyber threat actor leveraged a compromised end\\-user account from Constant Contact, a legitimate email marketing software company, to spoof a U.S.\\-based government organization and distribute links to malicious URLs.\\[\n [1](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/) \n ] CISA and FBI have not determined that any individual accounts have been specifically targeted by this campaign.\n \n\n\n\n**Note:** \n CISA and FBI acknowledge open\\-source reporting attributing the activity discussed in the report to APT29 (also known as Nobelium, The Dukes, and Cozy Bear).\\[\n [2](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/) \n ,\n [3](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/) \n ] However, CISA and FBI are investigating this activity and have not attributed it to any threat actor at this time. CISA and FBI will update this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory as new information becomes available. Note:\n \n\n\n\n This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory contains information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and malware associated with this campaign. For more information on the malware, refer to Malware Analysis Report\n [MAR\\-10339794\\-1\\.v1: Cobalt Strike Beacon](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-148a) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA and FBI urge governmental and international affairs organizations and individuals associated with such organizations to adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), refer to\n [AA21\\-148A.stix](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-148A.stix.xml) \n , and\n [MAR\\-10339794\\-1\\.v1\\.stix](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/IB-21-10094.stix.xml) \n .\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-148A-Sophisticated-Spearphishing_Campaign.pdf) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n Based on incident reports, malware collection, and trusted third\\-party reporting, CISA and FBI are engaged in addressing a sophisticated spearphishing campaign. A cyber threat actor leveraged a compromised end\\-user account from Constant Contact, a legitimate email marketing software company, to send phishing emails to more than 7,000 accounts across approximately 350 government organizations, IGOs, and NGOs. The threat actor sent spoofed emails that appeared to originate from a U.S. Government organization. The emails contained a legitimate Constant Contact link that redirected to a malicious URL \\[\n [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/002/) \n ,\n [T1204\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1204/001/) \n ], from which a malicious ISO file was dropped onto the victim\u2019s machine.\n \n\n\n\n The ISO file contained (1\\) a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named Documents.dll \\[\n [T1055\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1055/001/) \n ], which is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon version 4 implant, (2\\) a malicious shortcut file that executes the Cobalt Strike Beacon loader \\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1105/) \n ], and (3\\) a benign decoy PDF titled \u201cForeign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections\u201d with file name \u201cICA\\-declass.pdf\u201d (see figure 1\\). Note: The decoy file appears to be a copy of the declassified Intelligence Community Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 13848 Section 1(a), which is available at\n [https://www.intelligence.gov/index.php/ic\\-on\\-the\\-record\\-database/results/1046\\-foreign\\-threats\\-to\\-the\\-2020\\-us\\-federal\\-elections\\-intelligence\\-community\\-assessment](https://www.intelligence.gov/index.php/ic-on-the-record-database/results/1046-foreign-threats-to-the-2020-us-federal-elections-intelligence-community-assessment) \n .\n \n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1: Decoy PDF: ICA\\-declass.pdf\n \n\n\n\n[Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/) \n is a commercial penetration testing tool used to conduct red team operations.\\[\n [4](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/) \n ] It contains a number of tools that complement the cyber threat actor\u2019s exploitation efforts, such as a keystroke logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners. The Cobalt Strike Beacon is the malicious implant that calls back to attacker\\-controlled infrastructure and checks for additional commands to execute on the compromised system \\[\n [TA0011](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0011/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n The configuration file for this Cobalt Strike Beacon implant contained communications protocols, an implant watermark, and the following hardcoded command and control (C2\\) domains:\n \n\n\n* `dataplane.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2`\n* `cdn.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2`\n* `static.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2`\n* `worldhomeoutlet[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2`\n\n\n\n The configuration file was encoded via an XOR with the key\n `0x2e` \n and a 16\\-bit byte swap.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on the ISO file and Cobalt Strike Beacon implant, including IOCs, refer to Malware Analysis Report\n [MAR\\-10339794\\-1\\.v1: Cobalt Strike Beacon](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-148a) \n .\n \n\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n------------------------\n\n\n\n The following IOCS were derived from trusted third parties and open\\-source research.

While privileged accounts and remote access systems are critical, it is also important to ensure full coverage across SaaS solutions. Enabling MFA for corporate communications platforms (as with all other accounts) provides vital defense against these types of attacks and, in many cases, can prevent them.\n* Keep all software up to date. The most effective cybersecurity programs quickly update all of their software as soon as patches are available. If your organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for CVEs that are already known to be exploited.\n* Implement endpoint and detection response (EDR) tools. EDR allows a high degree of visibility into the security status of endpoints and is can be an effective tool against threat actors.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Note:** \n Organizations using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Microsoft 365 Defense should refer to Microsoft: Use attack surface reduction rules to prevent malware infection for more information on hardening the enterprise attack surface.\n* Implement centralized log management for host monitoring. A centralized logging application allows technicians to look out for anomalous activity in the network environment, such as new applications running on hosts, out\\-of\\-place communication between devices, or unaccountable login failures on machines. It also aids in troubleshooting applications or equipment in the event of a fault. CISA and the FBI recommend that organizations:\n\t+ Forward logs from local hosts to a centralized log management server\u2014often referred to as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool.\n\t+ Ensure logs are searchable. The ability to search, analyze, and visualize communications will help analysts diagnose issues and may lead to detection of anomalous activity.\n\t+ Correlate logs from both network and host security devices. By reviewing logs from multiple sources, an organization can better triage an individual event and determine its impact to the organization as a whole.\n\t+ Review both centralized and local log management policies to maximize efficiency and retain historical data. Organizations should retain critical logs for a minimum of 30 days.\n* Deploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt Strike servers and other post\\-exploitation tools.\n* Implement unauthorized execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\n* Configure and maintain user and administrative accounts using a strong account management policy.\n\t+ Use administrative accounts on dedicated administration workstations.\n\t+ Limit access to and use of administrative accounts.\n\t+ Use strong passwords. For more information on strong passwords, refer to CISA Tip: Choosing and Protecting Passwords and National Institute of Standards (NIST) SP 800\\-63: Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management.\n\t+ Remove default accounts if unneeded. Change the password of default accounts that are needed.\n\t+ Disable all unused accounts.\n* Implement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments and re\\-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.\n\n\nRESOURCES\n---------\n\n\n* Volexity Blog:\n [Suspected APT29 Operation Launches Election Fraud Themed Phishing Campaigns \\| Volexity](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/)\n* Microsoft Blog:\n [New sophisticated email\\-based attack from NOBELIUM \\- Microsoft Security](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\n* Microsoft Blog:\n [Another Nobelium Cyberattack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/)\n\n\n\n### Contact Information\n\n\n\n\n To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field office at\n [www.fbi.gov/contact\\-us/field](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field) \n , or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855\\) 292\\-3937 or by e\\-mail at\n [CyWatch@fbi.gov](mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov) \n .
