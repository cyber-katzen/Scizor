These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researcher Steven Seeley. Panasonic has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n Panasonic reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following products:\n \n\n\n* FPWIN Pro version 5\\.x,\n* FPWIN Pro version 6\\.x, and\n* FPWIN Pro version 7\\.122 and prior.\n\n\n\n Software releases 5\\.x have reached end\\-of\\-support, and users are advised to migrate to a supported release. Software releases 6\\.x are end\\-of\\-sales since April 2015 and will reach end\\-of\\-support in September 2016\\. Users using 6\\.x releases are advised to plan for an upgrade to the supported software release.\n \n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Reading malformed project file can crash Panasonic FPWIN Pro application. Vulnerabilities do not have direct impact on the system controlled by Panasonic FPWIN Pro application.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Panasonic Electric Works Europe AG is a Panasonic company developing automation products and industrial solutions.\n \n\n\n\n The affected product, FPWIN Pro, is programming software for all FP Series PLCs. According to Panasonic, FPWIN Pro is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, and Food and Agriculture. Panasonic estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe, North America, and Asia.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-122: Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122\\.html, web site last accessed May 10, 2016\\.\n\n\n\n\n There are multiple ways an attacker can overwrite portions of the heap, which may cause the program to crash.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2016\\-4499NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-4499, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malformed project file.\n \n\n\n#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n#### DIFFICULTY\n\n\n\n Crafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed project file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n Panasonic has released FPWIN Pro 7\\.130 software that addresses the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Fixed software can be downloaded from\n \n\n\n\n[https://www.panasonic\\-electric\\-works.com/eu/plc\\-software\\-control\\-fpwin\\-pro.htm](https://www.panasonic-electric-works.com/eu/plc-software-control-fpwin-pro.htm) \n\n\n\n\n Panasonic states that users may only install, use, and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.\n \n\n\n\n For more information about these issues or other vulnerabilities in Panasonic products, please contact the Panasonic Product Security Incident Response Team:\n \n\n\n\n[https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/product\\-security/sec/psirt.html](https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/product-security/sec/psirt.html) \n\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation.
