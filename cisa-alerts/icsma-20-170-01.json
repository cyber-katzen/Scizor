Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker who has gained unauthorized access to system resources, including access to execute software or to view/update files, directories, or system configuration. This could allow an attacker with network access to view sensitive data including PHI.\nCVE-2020-12016 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11, and 1.13, and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4 have hard-coded administrative account credentials for the ExactaMix application. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker with physical access to gain unauthorized access to view/update system configuration or data. This\ncould impact confidentiality and integrity of the system and risk exposure of sensitive information including PHI.\nCVE-2020-12012 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-319\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2 systems use cleartext messages to communicate order information with an order entry system. This could allow an attacker with network access to view sensitive data including PHI.\nCVE-2020-12008 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2 systems store device data with sensitive information in an unencrypted database. This could allow an attacker with network access to view or modify sensitive data including PHI. \u00a0\nCVE-2020-12032 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 versions 1.10, 1.11, 1.13, 1.14 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5 does not restrict access to the USB interface from an unauthorized user with physical access. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker with physical access to the system the ability to load an unauthorized payload or unauthorized access to the hard drive by booting a live USB OS. This could impact confidentiality and integrity of the system and risk exposure of sensitive information including PHI.\nCVE-2020-12024 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11, and 1.13 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4 does not restrict non administrative users from gaining access to the operating system and editing the application startup script. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to alter the startup script as the limited-access user.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-12020 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nBaxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2 does not validate or incorrectly validates input via the SMBv1 port that can affect the control flow or data flow of a system.
