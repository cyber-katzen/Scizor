MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Baxter recommends that users of the ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1\\.10 and 1\\.11, and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1\\.1 and 1\\.2, should contact the service support team or regional product service support to upgrade to the ExactaMix Version 1\\.4 (EM1200\\) and ExactaMix Version 1\\.13 (EM2400\\) compounders.\n   \n\n  \n\n For all users, Baxter recommends the following compensating controls including, but not limited to:\n \n\n\n* Ensure appropriate physical controls within user\u2019s environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices.\n* Ensure ExactaMix Compounder passwords are kept confidential. Users should implement administrative controls to ensure they are not misused, mismanaged, or otherwise shared with unauthorized individuals.\n* The device should be used only in accordance with its intended use and not for email, Internet access, file sharing, or other non\\-approved use. No software of any kind should be installed on the device unless approved, in writing, by Baxter.\n* The ExactaMix Compounder should be segmented from the enterprise main network, and block all non\\-required communication via firewall and ACL configuration.\n* Users should follow standard guidance to ensure security patches are up to date across the network.\n* Users should follow proper backup and storage procedures to maintain the integrity of data utilized with the ExactaMix Compounder.\n\n\n\n Baxter separately provided an ExactaMix Cybersecurity Guide, instructing users on good cybersecurity practices relevant to the use of the ExactaMix product. The guide can be requested from\n [productsecurity@baxter.com](mailto:productsecurity@baxter.com) \n\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n For additional information please see the\n [Baxter Product Security Bulletin](https://www.baxter.com/product-security#additionalresources) \n .\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End\u00a0Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.
