The target of this type of attack is not the CompactLogix itself. Instead, the CompactLogix is a vehicle used to deliver an attack to the web browser.\u00a0\nCVE-2016-2279 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 5 ---------\nAditya Sood and Venkatesh Sivakumar (@PranavVenkatS) reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 5 ---------\n5. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends that users of 1769-L23E-QB1B migrate to 1769-L24ER-BB1B and users of 1769-L23E-QBFC1B migrate to 1769-L24ER-QBFC1B.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 5 ---------\nFor 1756-EN2F Series C, 1756-EN2T Series D, 1756-EN2TR Series C, and 1756-EN3TRSeries B, Rockwell Automation recommends users apply FRN 10.010 or later available at:\nhttps://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=1756-EN3TR&crumb=112\nFor earlier versions: users using previous series of the affected 1756 EtherNet/IP catalog numbers are urged to assess their risk and, if necessary, contact their local distributor or sales office in order to upgrade to a newer product line that contains the relevant mitigations.\n--------- End Update A Part 4 of 5 ---------\nFor the other affected versions listed above, Rockwell Automation recommends users apply firmware Version 28.011+ available at:\nhttp://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID=4\nFor more detailed information, please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security notification (KB731098), available at the following URL with a valid account:\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/731098\n--------- Begin Update A Part 5 of 5 ---------\nRockwell Automation also recommends the following security practices:\n\nDo not click on or open URL links from untrusted sources.\nEmploy training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\nEmploy training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 5 of 5 ---------\n",
