The target of this type of attack is not the CompactLogix itself. Instead, the CompactLogix is a vehicle used to deliver an attack to the web browser.[CVE\\-2016\\-2279](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2279)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Aditya Sood and Venkatesh Sivakumar (@PranavVenkatS) reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** 5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation recommends that users of 1769\\-L23E\\-QB1B migrate to 1769\\-L24ER\\-BB1B and users of 1769\\-L23E\\-QBFC1B migrate to 1769\\-L24ER\\-QBFC1B.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 4 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For 1756\\-EN2F Series C, 1756\\-EN2T Series D, 1756\\-EN2TR Series C, and 1756\\-EN3TRSeries B, Rockwell Automation recommends users apply FRN 10\\.010 or later available at:[https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword\\=1756\\-EN3TR\\&crumb\\=112](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=1756-EN3TR&crumb=112)  For earlier versions: users using previous series of the affected 1756 EtherNet/IP catalog numbers are urged to assess their risk and, if necessary, contact their local distributor or sales office in order to upgrade to a newer product line that contains the relevant mitigations.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 4 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For the other affected versions listed above, Rockwell Automation recommends users apply firmware Version 28\\.011\\+ available at:[http://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID\\=4](http://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID=4)  For more detailed information, please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security notification (KB731098\\), available at the following URL with a valid account:<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/731098>**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Rockwell Automation also recommends the following security practices:* Do not click on or open URL links from untrusted sources.* Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.* Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.* Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.Vendor------* Rockwell Automation-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-16-061-02)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01) Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02) Jul 16, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01) Jul 11, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
