EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v4 5\\.6**\n* **ATTENTION** \n : Low attack complexity\n* **Vendor** \n : Emerson\n* **Equipment** \n : PACSystem, Fanuc\n* **Vulnerabilities** \n : Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity Insufficiently Protected Credentials, Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n\n\n\n CISA is aware of a public report, known as \"OT:ICEFALL\", detailing vulnerabilities found in multiple operational technology (OT) vendors. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.\n \n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution, loss of sensitive information, or a denial\\-of\\-service condition.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following Emerson products are affected:\n \n\n\n* PAC Machine Edition: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30265\\)\n* PACSystem RXi: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30268, CVE\\-2022\\-30266\\)\n* PACSystem RX3i: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30268, CVE\\-2022\\-30265\\)\n* PACSystem RSTi\\-EP: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30268, CVE\\-2022\\-30266, CVE\\-2022\\-30265\\)\n* PACSystem VersaMax: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30265\\)\n* Fanuc VersaMax: All versions (CVE\\-2022\\-30263, CVE\\-2022\\-30268, CVE\\-2022\\-30266\\)\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)\n\n\n\n The affected product utilizes a protocol that allows cleartext transmission of credentials. This could allow an attacker to retrieve these over the network and gain control of the PLC, but cryptographically secure authentication using the SRP\\-6a protocol is supported and recommended. Enabling authentication on the PLC prevents replay attacks, and requires the attacker to intercept and modify an active connection. Implementation of a non\\-routing control network also requires compromise of the network topology before SRTP packets can be intercepted.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-30263](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30263) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\n [CVE\\-2022\\-30263](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30263) \n . A base score of 4\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS4\\.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) \n )\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.2** \n[**INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE\\-345**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)\n\n\n\n The affected products use the Winloader utility to manage firmware updates by serial port or a serial\\-over\\-Ethernet link that were found to not use authentication. This could allow an attacker to push malicious firmware images to the controller and cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or allow remote code execution. This vulnerability only effects version of the CPE302, 205, and 310 that were produced before the \"\\-Bxxx\" hardware revisions.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-30268](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30268) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 4\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\n [CVE\\-2022\\-30268](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30268) \n . A base score of 5\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS4\\.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) \n )\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.3** \n[**INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-522**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)\n\n\n\n The affected product uses a simple hashing scheme by client\\-side JavaScript. This could allow an attacker to intercept the hashes and strip the hashing scheme to obtain the credentials in plaintext. These credentials are only valid for 5 minutes due to the TLS protocol used, and also requires physical presence to press a button on the device, limiting this attack to being physically present and in a very short window. If this is accomplished, this only allows the attacker to upgrade or downgrade the firmware version. Due to this threat of Man\\-in\\-the\\-Middle attack, documentation recommends limiting physical access to networking equipment, and disabling IP routing on control networks. This vulnerability does not apply to older PLCs without a network\\-based update process.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-30266](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30266) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 4\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\n [CVE\\-2022\\-30266](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30266) \n .
