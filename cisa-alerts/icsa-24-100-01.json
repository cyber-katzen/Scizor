EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.6\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: SUBNET Solutions Inc.\nEquipment: PowerSYSTEM Server, Substation Server 2021\nVulnerabilities: Reliance on Insufficiently Trustworthy Component\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in components used by PowerSYSTEM Server 2021 and Substation Server 2021 could allow privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSUBNET Solutions reports that the following products use components with vulnerabilities:\n\nPowerSYSTEM Server: version 4.07.00 and prior\nSubstation Server 2021: version 4.07.00 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 RELIANCE ON INSUFFICIENTLY TRUSTWORTHY COMPONENT CWE-1357\nSUBNET Solutions Inc. has identified vulnerabilities in third-party components used in PowerSYSTEM Server 2021 and Substation Server 2021.\nCVE-2024-3313 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3313. A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSUBNET Solutions reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSubnet Solutions has fixed these issues by identifying and replacing out of date libraries used in previous versions of PowerSYSTEM Server and Substation Server 2021. Users are advised to update to version 4.09.00.927 or newer. To obtain this software, contact Subnet Solution's Customer Service.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nApril 9, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
