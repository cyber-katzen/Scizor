These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit\u00a0stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.\nThe FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Cuba ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated with Cuba ransomware actors identified through FBI investigations, third-party reporting, and open-source reporting. This advisory updates the December 2021\u00a0FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba Ransomware.\nNote: While this ransomware is known by industry as \u201cCuba ransomware,\u201d there is no indication Cuba ransomware actors have any connection or affiliation with the Republic of Cuba.\nSince the release of the December 2021 FBI Flash, the number of U.S. entities compromised by Cuba ransomware has doubled, with ransoms demanded and paid on the increase.\nThis year, Cuba ransomware actors have added to their TTPs, and third-party and open-source reports have identified a possible link between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors.\nFBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Cuba ransomware and other ransomware operations.\nDownload the PDF version of this report: pdf, 649 kb.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\nAA22-335A.stix (STIX 148 kb).\n(Updated December 12, 2022) AA22-335A-2.stix (STIX, 67 kb). (End of Update.)\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nOverview\nSince the December 2021 release of FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba Ransomware, FBI has observed Cuba ransomware actors continuing to target U.S. entities in the following five critical infrastructure sectors: Financial Services, Government Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, Critical Manufacturing, and Information Technology. As of August 2022, FBI has identified that Cuba ransomware actors have:\n\nCompromised 101 entities, 65 in the United States and 36 outside the United States.\nDemanded 145 million U.S. Dollars (USD) and received 60 million USD in ransom payments.\n\nCuba Ransomware Actors\u2019 Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\nAs previously reported by FBI, Cuba ransomware actors have leveraged the following techniques to gain initial access into dozens of entities in multiple critical infrastructure sectors:\n\nKnown vulnerabilities in commercial software [T1190]\nPhishing campaigns [T1566]\nCompromised credentials [T1078]\nLegitimate remote desktop protocol (RDP) tools [T1563.002]\n\nAfter gaining initial access, the actors distributed Cuba ransomware on compromised systems through Hancitor\u2014a loader known for dropping or executing stealers, such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other types of ransomware, onto victims\u2019 networks.\nSince spring 2022, Cuba ransomware actors have modified their TTPs and tools to interact with compromised networks and extort payments from victims.[1],[2]\nCuba ransomware actors have exploited known vulnerabilities and weaknesses and have used tools to elevate privileges on compromised systems. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42,[2] Cuba ransomware actors have:\n\nExploited CVE-2022-24521 in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver to steal system tokens and elevate privileges.\nUsed a PowerShell script to identify and target service accounts for their associated Active Directory Kerberos ticket. The actors then collected and cracked the Kerberos tickets offline via Kerberoasting [T1558.003].\nUsed a tool, called KerberCache, to extract cached Kerberos tickets from a host\u2019s Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) memory [T1003.001].\nUsed a tool to exploit CVE-2020-1472 (also known as \u201cZeroLogon\u201d) to gain Domain Administrative privileges [T1068]. This tool and its intrusion attempts have been reportedly related to Hancitor and Qbot.\n\nAccording to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Cuba ransomware actors use tools to evade detection while moving laterally through compromised environments before executing Cuba ransomware. Specifically, the actors, \u201cleveraged a dropper that writes a kernel driver to the file system called ApcHelper.sys. This targets and terminates security products. The dropper was not signed; however, the kernel driver was signed using the certificate found in the LAPSUS NVIDIA leak.\" [T1562.001].[2]\nIn addition to deploying ransomware, the actors have used \u201cdouble extortion\u201d techniques, in which they exfiltrate victim data, and (1) demand a ransom payment to decrypt it and, (2) threaten to publicly release it if a ransom payment is not made.[2]\nCuba Ransomware Link to RomCom and Industrial Spy Marketplace\nSince spring 2022, third-party and open-source reports have identified an apparent link between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom RAT actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors:\n\nAccording to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Cuba ransomware actors began using RomCom malware, a custom RAT, for command and control (C2).[2]\nCuba ransomware actors may also be leveraging Industrial Spy ransomware. According to third-party reporting, suspected Cuba ransomware actors compromised a foreign healthcare company. The threat actors deployed Industrial Spy ransomware, which shares distinct similarities in configuration to Cuba ransomware. Before deploying the ransomware, the actors moved laterally using Impacket and deployed the RomCom RAT and Meterpreter Reverse Shell HTTP/HTTPS proxy via a C2 server [T1090].\nCuba ransomware actors initially used their leak site to sell stolen data; however, around May 2022, the actors began selling their data on Industrial Spy\u2019s online market for selling stolen data.[2]\n\nRomCom actors have targeted foreign military organizations, IT companies, food brokers and manufacturers.[3][4] The actors copied legitimate HTML code from public-facing webpages, modified the code, and then incorporated it in spoofed domains [T1584.001], which allowed the RomCom actors to:\n\nHost counterfeit Trojanized applications for\n\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM),\nKeePass password manager,\nPDF Reader Pro, (by PDF Technologies, Inc., not an Adobe Acrobat or Reader product), and\nAdvanced IP Scanner software;\n\n\nDeploy the RomCom RAT as the final stage.\n\nINDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\nSee tables 1 through 5 for Cuba ransomware IOCs that FBI obtained during threat response investigations as of late August 2022. In addition to these tables, see the publications in the References section below for aid in detecting possible exploitation or compromise.\nNote: For IOCs as of early November 2021, see FBI Flash:

[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\nFBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Cuba ransomware:\n\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.\n\nUse longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length.\nStore passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\nAdd password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\nAvoid reusing passwords.\nImplement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.\nDisable password \u201chints.\u201d\nRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\nNote: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\n\nRequire multifactor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\nKeep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching SonicWall firewall vulnerabilities and known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. Note: SonicWall maintains a vulnerability list that includes Advisory ID, CVE, and mitigation. Their list can be found at psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-list.\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\nInstall, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or unrecognized accounts.\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.\nDisable unused ports.\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\nDisable hyperlinks in received emails.\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). JIT sets a network-wide policy in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nStopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\nResource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nNo-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment.\n\nREPORTING\nFBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with ransomware actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\nFBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents immediately.
