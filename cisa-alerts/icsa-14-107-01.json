Siemens has produced a software update that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens product is affected:\n\nSINEMA server: all versions prior to V12 SP1\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessfull exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in attackers performing remote code execution, traversing through the file system, or causing a denial of service.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected product, SINEMA, is a network management appliance for industrial applications and allows network monitoring as well as diagnostics and reporting functions integrated into SCADA systems such as WinCC. According to Siemens, SINEMA products are deployed across several sectors including critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, government facilities, chemical, water and wastewater, energy, and others. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCODE INJECTIONCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection', http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\nThe integrated web servers at Port 4999/TCP and Port 80/TCP could allow unauthenticated remote code execution if an attacker has network access to the server.\nCVE-2014-2731NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2731, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\nRELATIVE PATH TRAVERSALCWE-23: Relative Path Traversal, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\nThe integrated web servers at Port 4999/TCP and Port 80/TCP could allow unauthenticated directory traversal on the server based on the application\u2019s file system permissions if an attacker has network access to the server.\nCVE-2014-2732NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2732, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\nAn attacker could cause a denial of service of the SINEMA web interfaces at Port 4999/TCP and Port 80/TCP if specially crafted HTTP requests are sent to these ports. To recover the web interfaces, the SINEMA server has to be restarted via the SINEMAserver-Monitor.\n\n\nCVE-2014-2733NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2733, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, web site last accessed April 17, 2014.\n\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has provided a software update (V12 SP1) for SINEMA server that fixes these vulnerabilities. Users of these systems may find it at the following location at Siemens web site:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/de/74758725\nFor more information on this vulnerability, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-364879 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
