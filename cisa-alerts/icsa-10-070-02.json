  "markdown": "\nOverview\nRockwell Automation has identified a security vulnerability in the programming and configuration client software authentication mechanism employed by certain versions of the PLC-5 and SLC 5/0x family of programmable controllers.\nAffected Products\nRockwell PLC-5 and SLC 5/0x controllers are affected, including the following catalog numbers: 1785-Lx and 1747-L5x. The programming and configuration client software, RSLogix, for these devices is also affected by this vulnerability. For a complete listing of affected products and firmware versions, please see Rockwell\u2019s Technotes.Rockwell Technote, http://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66684/kw/vulnerability/r_id/115100, website last accessed March 4, 2010.,Rockwell Technote, http://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66678/kw/vulnerability/r_id/115100, website last accessed March 4, 2010.\nImpact\nA significant number of PLC-5s and SLC 500s are installed worldwide. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may expose the controller\u2019s access control password and allow unauthorized programming of the controller.Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization.\nICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nRockwell PLC-5 and SLC 5/0x controllers are used worldwide in diverse process control environments. These PLCs can be used in both centralized control systems and in remote installations, including remotecommunication and control to enable SCADA solutions for water/waste-water treatment facilities.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nThe following two vulnerabilities have been identified:\n\nThe potential exists for exposure of the product's password used to restrict unauthorized access to the controller.To expose the password, an attacker would need direct access to the product or the control system communication link between the controller and configuration software. The attacker could then intercept and decipher the product\u2019s password and use it to emulate the role of the client software to gain unauthorized access to the product.\nThe potential exists for an unauthorized programming and configuration client to gain access to the product and allow changes to the product\u2019s configuration or program.An attacker, with direct access to the product or the control system communication link between the controller and configuration software, could emulate the role of a trusted software client andpotentially make unauthorized changes to the product.\n\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nAn attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities in order to:\n\nCause a denial of service.\nGain unauthorized access with elevated privileges to the product.\nPossibly leverage these vulnerabilities in an attempt to find additional vulnerabilities elsewhere in a control system network.\n\nExistence of Exploit\nThere are currently no known exploits specifically targeting these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nResearch indicates that these vulnerabilities can be easily exploited by a skilled attacker; however, access to the control system network is required for successful exploitation.\nMitigation\nTo help reduce the likelihood of exploitation and associated security risk, Rockwell Automation recommends the following immediate mitigation strategies (Note: multiple strategies are recommended to be employed simultaneously):\n\nFor PLC-5 controllers, enable and configure \"Passwords and Privileges\" via RSLogix 5 configuration software to restrict access to critical data and improve overall password security.\nWhen applicable, upgrade product firmware to a version that includes enhanced security functionality compatible with Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Security services. This functionality can be enabled via RSLogix 5 or RSLogix 500 software.

Refer to http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.\nBlock all traffic to the CSP, Ethernet/IP, or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by restricting or blocking access to TCP and UDP Port 2222 and Port 44818 using appropriate security technology (e.g., a firewall, UTM devices, or other security device).\nRestrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to make changes to control system equipment.\nFrequently change the product\u2019s password and obsolete previously used passwords to reduceexposure to threat from a product password becoming known.\n\nThe Control System Security Program also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the US-CERT website. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.Control System Security Program (CSSP) Recommended Practices, http://csrp.inl.gov/Recommended_Practices.html, website last accessed January 12, 2010.\n",
