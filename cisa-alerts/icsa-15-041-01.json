Users may download the patch from the following location at Advantech\u2019s web site:[http://support.advantech.com.tw/Support/DownloadSRDetail\\_New.aspx?SR\\_ID\\=1\\-V6XOHK\\&Doc\\_Source\\=Download](http://support.advantech.com.tw/Support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-V6XOHK&Doc_Source=Download)  For additional information about the EKI 1221, please visit the following Advantech web site:[http://www.advantech.com/products/INDUSTRIAL\\_COMMUNICATION/EKI\\-1221/mod\\_A4DB49EB\\-38F0\\-4745\\-A83C\\-B0EAC73AC0B3\\.aspx](http://www.advantech.com/products/INDUSTRIAL_COMMUNICATION/EKI-1221/mod_A4DB49EB-38F0-4745-A83C-B0EAC73AC0B3.aspx)  ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
