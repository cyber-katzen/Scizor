EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Industrial Control Links\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0ScadaFlex II SCADA Controllers\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0\u00a0External Control of File Name or Path\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to overwrite, delete, or create files.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Industrial Control Links ScadaFlex II SCADA Controllers are affected:\u00a0\n\nSW: 1.03.07 (build 317), WebLib: 1.24\u00a0\nSW: 1.02.20 (build 286), WebLib: 1.24\u00a0\nSW: 1.02.15 (build 286), WebLib: 1.22\u00a0\nSW: 1.02.01 (build 229), WebLib: 1.16\u00a0\nSW: 1.01.14 (build 172), WebLib: 1.14\u00a0\nSW: 1.01.01 (build 2149), WebLib: 1.13\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0EXTERNAL CONTROL OF FILE NAME OR PATH CWE-73\u00a0\nOn ICL ScadaFlex II SCADA Controller SC-1 and SC-2 devices, unauthenticated remote attackers can overwrite, delete, or create files. This allows an attacker to execute critical file CRUD operations on the device that can potentially allow system access and impact availability.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-25359\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0North America, South America\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof-of-concept (PoC) as authored by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab. \u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nIndustrial Control Links has relayed that they are closing their business. This product may be considered end-of-life; continued supported for this product may be unavailable.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\u00a0\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
