EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Moxa\nEquipment: ioLogik 2542-HSPA Series Controllers and IOs, and IOxpress Configuration Utility\nVulnerabilities: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device or allow access to sensitive information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMoxa reports these vulnerabilities affects the following products:\n\nioLogik 2500 series firmware, Version 3.0 or lower\nIOxpress configuration utility, Version 2.3.0 or lower\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-312\nSensitive information is stored in configuration files without encryption, which may allow an attacker to access an administrative account.\nCVE-2019-18238 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nSensitive information is transmitted over some web applications in clear text.\nCVE-2020-7003 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECTLY SPECIFIED DESTINATION IN A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL CWE-941\nFrequent and multiple requests for short-term use may cause the web server to fail.\nCVE-2019-18242 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIlya Karpov and Evgeniy Druzhinin from Rostelecom-Solar reported these vulnerabilities to Moxa.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMoxa has developed a solution to address these vulnerabilities: Please contact Moxa Technical Support for a security patch.\nPlease see Moxa\u2019s security advisory for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\n\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
