EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.7*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  Lumada APM* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any Power BI reports installed or manipulate asset issue comments on assets.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Hitachi Energy reports the following products are affected:* Lumada APM \u2013 SaaS: Versions 6\\.0\\.0\\.0 to 6\\.4\\.220601\\.0* Lumada APM \u2013 On Premises: Versions 6\\.0\\.0\\.0\\.0 to 6\\.4\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** Hitachi Energy Lumada APM has a flaw in the access control mechanism implementation on the \u201cLimited Engineer\u201d role, granting access to the embedded Power BI reports feature. This could allow an unauthorized user to access information by gaining unauthorized access to any installed Power BI reports, then manipulating asset issue comments on assets that should not be available to that user.[CVE\\-2022\\-2155](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2155)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy advises users that the vulnerability is remediated in Lumada APM v6\\.4\\.0\\.1\\. Lumada APM v6\\.5\\.0\\.0 and later are not affected. According to Hitachi Energy, the \u201cOn Premise\u201d edition of Lumada APM does not support the Power BI integration feature. However, users can connect a subscription\\-based Power BI to Lumada APM. If the Power BI integration feature is enabled, Hitachi Energy recommends:* Disabling the unsupported Power BI integration feature if there are users with \u201cLimited Engineer\u201d role.* Removing the any users with \u201cLimited Engineer\u201d role.* Assigning users to another role prior to using the unsupported Power BI integration feature. Note: If Power BI integration is disabled, it is safe to continue to assign the \u201cLimited Engineer\u201d role to users. Hitachi Energy also recommends the following security practices:* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel,* Ensure affected equipment has no direct connections to the internet,* Separate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with a minimal number exposed of ports. Hitachi Energy advises that process control systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system.
