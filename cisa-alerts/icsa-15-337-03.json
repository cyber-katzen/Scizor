Pacom has not produced a patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities, but has fixed the new EMCS system.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. The researchers are planning to publicly disclose these vulnerabilities next week.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Pacom GMS systems are affected:\n\nPacom 1000 CCU and RTU.\n\nIMPACT\nThe flaw can be used by a perpetrator to take control over the communication between the controller and base station.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nPacom is a Sweden-based company that has its products installed worldwide.\nThe affected products, Pacom GMS systems, are network-enabled security panels that control, monitor, and maintain security for a remote site and control all alarm and door functions. Pacom GMS systems are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Financial Services, Government Facilities, and Healthcare and Public Health. These products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCRYTOGRAPHIC ISSUESCWE-310: Cryptographic Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html, web site last accessed December 03, 2015.\n\nThere are several implementation flaws in the cryptography in the Pacom GMS systems.\nCVE-2014-3260NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3260, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 03, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target these vulnerabilities will be made publicly available next week.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nPacom has not produced a patch to mitigate this vulnerability in Pacom 1000 CCU and RTU but has released new firmware (v1.3) for the EMCS system.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
