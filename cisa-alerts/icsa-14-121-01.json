MSM does not have sufficient session management to prevent modification of message requests. This could allow a valid user to retrieve sensitive message contents and exposing personally identifiable information of other users. CVE\\-2014\\-2347NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-2347, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N, web site last accessed May 01, 2014\\.### AUTHENTICATIONCWE\\-287: Improper Authentication, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287\\.html, web site last accessed May 01, 2014\\. MSM does not contain sufficient authentication complexity that may allow an attacker to receive message traffic between healthcare providers and patients, potentially exposing personally identifiable information. CVE\\-2014\\-0357NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-0357, web site last accessed May 01, 2014\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N, web site last accessed May 01, 2014\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.#### DIFFICULTY Crafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would need a moderate skill level. An amount of session modification is required to exploit these vulnerabilities. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.MITIGATION---------- AMTELCO has developed an update, Version 6\\.3, that resolves these vulnerabilities.
