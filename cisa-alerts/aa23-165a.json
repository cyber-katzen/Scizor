Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international partners, hereafter referred to as \u201cauthoring organizations,\u201d are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended mitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization\u2019s defenses against this ransomware operation.\u00a0\n\nAustralian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\nCanadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)\nNational Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI)\nGermany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)\nNew Zealand\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC NZ)\u00a0\n\nThe authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents.\n\n\nUnderstanding Ransomware Threat Actors: LockBit\n(PDF,       1.24 MB\n  )\n\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13.1. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of LockBit\u2019s activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae tactics and techniques.\nIntroduction\nThe LockBit RaaS and its affiliates have negatively impacted organizations, both large and small, across the world. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group maintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant to individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as \u201caffiliates\u201d), and supports affiliates\u2019 deployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits, or a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. Some of the methods LockBit has used to successfully attract affiliates include, but are not limited to:\n\nAssuring payment by allowing affiliates to receive ransom payments before sending a cut to the core group; this practice stands in stark contrast to other RaaS groups who pay themselves first and then disburse the affiliates\u2019 cut.\nDisparaging other RaaS groups in online forums.\nEngaging in publicity-generating activities stunts, such as paying people to get LockBit tattoos and putting a $1 million bounty on information related to the real-world identity of LockBit\u2019s lead who goes by the persona \u201cLockBitSupp.\u201d\nDeveloping and maintaining a simplified, point-and-click interface for its ransomware, making it accessible to those with a lower degree of technical skill. [2, 3]\n\nLockBit has been successful through innovation and ongoing development of the group\u2019s administrative panel and the RaaS supporting functions. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit and other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing ransomware.\nTable 1 shows LockBit RaaS\u2019s innovation and development.\nTable 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\nSeptember 2019\nFirst observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor to LockBit. [4]\n\n\nJanuary 2020\nLockBit-named ransomware first seen on Russian-language based cybercrime forums.\n\n\nJune 2021\nAppearance of LockBit version 2 (LockBit 2.0), also known as LockBit Red including StealBit, a built-in information-stealing tool.\n\n\nOctober 2021\nIntroduction of LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0 expanding capabilities to target systems to Linux and VMware ESXi. [5]\n\n\nMarch 2022\nEmergence of LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, that shares similarities with BlackMatter and Alphv (also known as BlackCat) ransomware.\n\n\nSeptember 2022\nNon-LockBit affiliates able to use LockBit 3.0 after its builder was leaked. [2, 6]\n\n\nJanuary 2023\nArrival of LockBit Green incorporating source code from Conti ransomware. [7]\n\n\nApril 2023\nLockBit ransomware encryptors targeting macOS seen on VirusTotal [8, 9]\n\n\n\nLockBit 2.0, LockBit 3.0, LockBit Green, and LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker are still available for affiliates\u2019 use on LockBit\u2019s panel.\nLockBit Statistics\nPercentage of ransomware incidents attributed to LockBit:\n\nAustralia: From April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, LockBit made up 18% of total reported Australian ransomware incidents. This figure includes all variants of LockBit ransomware, not solely LockBit 3.0.\nCanada: In 2022, LockBit was responsible for 22% of attributed ransomware incidents in Canada.[10]\nNew Zealand: In 2022, CERT NZ received 15 reports of LockBit ransomware, representing 23% of 2022 ransomware reports.\nUnited States: In 2022, 16% of the State, Local, Tribal, and Tribunal (SLTT) government ransomware incidents reported to the MS-ISAC were identified as LockBit attacks. This included ransomware incidents impacting municipal governments, county governments, public higher education and K-12 schools, and emergency services (e.g., law enforcement).\n\nNumber of LockBit ransomware attacks in the U.S. since 2020:\n\nAbout 1,700 attacks according to the FBI.\n\nTotal of U.S. ransoms paid to LockBit:\n\nApproximately $91M since LockBit activity was first observed in the U.S. on January 5, 2020.\n\nEarliest observed LockBit activity:\n\nAustralia: The earliest documented occurrence of LockBit 3.0 was in early August 2022.\nCanada: The first recorded instance of LockBit activity in Canada was in March 2020.\nNew Zealand: The first recorded incident involving LockBit ransomware was in March 2021.\nUnited States: LockBit activity was first observed on January 5, 2020.\n\nMost recently observed LockBit activity:\n\nAustralia: April 21, 2023.\nNew Zealand: February 2023.\nUnited States: As recently as May 25, 2023.\n\nOperational activity related to LockBit in France\nSince the first case in July 2020 to present, ANSSI has handled 80 alerts linked to the LockBit ransomware, which accounts for 11% of all ransomware cases handled by ANSSI in that period. In about 13% of those cases, ANSSI was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of its constituents\u2019 networks \u2013 as the alerts were related to the threat actor\u2019s online claims. So far, 69 confirmed incidents have been handled by ANSSI. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall ransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR).\nTable 2: ANSSI-Observed LockBit vs. Overall Ransomware Activity\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber of Incidents\nPercentage of CERT-FR\u2019s Ransomware-Related Activity\n\n\n2020 (from July)\n4\n2%\n\n\n2021\n20\n10%\n\n\n2022\n30\n27%\n\n\n2023\n15\n27%\n\n\nTotal (2020-2023)\n69\n11%\n\n\n\nTable 3 shows the number of instances different LockBit strains were observed by ANSSI from July 2020 to present.\nTable 3: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strain and Number of Instances\n\n\n\nName of the Strain*\nNumber of Instances\n\n\nLockBit 2.0 (LockBit Red)\n26\n\n\nLockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black)\n23\n\n\nLockBit\n21\n\n\nLockBit Green\n1\n\n\nLockBit (pre-encryption)\n1\n\n\nTotal\n72**\n\n\n\n* Name either obtained from ANSSI\u2019s or the victim\u2019s investigations** Includes incidents with multiple strains\n\n \n\n\nFigure 1: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strains by Year\nFrom the incidents handled, ANSSI can infer that LockBit 3.0 widely took over from LockBit 2.0 and the original LockBit strain from 2022. In two cases, victims were infected with as many as three different strains of LockBit (LockBit 2.0/Red, LockBit 3.0/Black, and LockBit Green).\nLeak Sites\nThe authoring agencies observe data leak sites, where attackers publish the names and captured data of victims if they do not pay ransom or hush money. Additionally, these sites can be used to record alleged victims who have been threatened with a data leak. The term 'victims' may include those who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack having taken place).\nThe leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates\u2019 victims subjected to secondary extortion. Since 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then exfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Because LockBit only reveals the names and leaked data of victims who refuse to pay the primary ransom to decrypt their data, some LockBit victims may never be named or have their exfiltrated data posted on leak sites. As a result, the leak sites reveal a portion of LockBit affiliates\u2019 total victims. For these reasons, the leak sites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data publication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware attacks.\nUp to the Q1 2023, a total of 1,653 alleged victims were observed on LockBit leak sites. With the introduction of LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0, the leak sites have changed, with some sources choosing to differentiate leak sites by LockBit versions and others ignoring any differentiation. Over time, and through different evolutions of LockBit, the address and layout of LockBit leak sites have changed and are aggregated under the common denominator of the LockBit name. The introduction of LockBit 2.0 at the end of the Q2 2021 had an immediate impact on the cybercriminal market due to multiple RaaS operations shutting down in May and June 2021 (e.g., DarkSide and Avaddon). LockBit competed with other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020.\n\n \n\n\nFigure 2: Alleged Number of Victims Worldwide on LockBit Leak Sites\nTools\nDuring their intrusions, LockBit affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source tools that are intended for legal use. When repurposed by LockBit, these tools are then used for a range of malicious cyber activity, such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling, credential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and batch scripts are observed across most intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and privilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike have also been observed.\nTable 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed for ransomware operations. The legitimate freeware and open-source tools mentioned in this product are all publicly available and legal. The use of these tools by a threat actor should not be attributed to the freeware and open-source tools, absent specific articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.\nTable 4: Freeware and Open-Source Tools Used by LockBit Affiliates\n\n\n\nTool\nIntended Use\nRepurposed Use by LockBit Affiliates\nMITRE ATT&CK ID\n\n\n7-zip\nCompresses

Execution Vulnerability, as well as newer vulnerabilities such as:\n\nCVE-2023-0669: Fortra GoAnyhwere Managed File Transfer (MFT) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nCVE-2023-27350: PaperCut MF/NG Improper Access Control Vulnerability\n\nLockBit affiliates have been documented exploiting numerous CVEs, including:\n\nCVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,\nCVE-2021-22986: F5 BIG-IP and BIG-IQ Centralized Management iControl REST Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,\nCVE-2020-1472: NetLogon Privilege Escalation

Path Traversal Vulnerability.\n\nFor further information on these CVEs, see CISA\u2019s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.\nPost Detonation TTPs\nWhen LockBit affiliates target an organization responsible for managing other organizations\u2019 networks, CERT NZ has observed LockBit affiliates attempt secondary ransomware extortion after detonation of the LockBit variant on the primary target. Once the primary target is hit, LockBit affiliates then attempt to extort the companies that are customers of the primary target.

These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\nThe listed mitigations are ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactic. Mitigations that apply to multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics are listed under the tactic that occurs earliest in an incident\u2019s lifecycle. For example, account use polices are mitigations for initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and credential access but would be listed under initial access mitigations.\nInitial Access\n\nConsider implementing sandboxed browsers to protect systems from malware originating from web browsing. Sandboxed browsers isolate the host machine from malicious code.\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply with NIST standards for developing and managing password policies [CPG 2.L].\n\nEnforce use of longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters in length [CPG 2.B, 2.C].\nStore passwords in a salted and hashed format using industry-recognized password hashing algorithms.\nPrevent use of commonly used or known-compromised passwords [CPG 2.C].\nImplement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 2.G].\nDisable password \u201chints.\u201d\nRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software [CPG 2.Q].\n\n\nImplement filters at the email gateway to filter out emails with known malicious indicators, such as known malicious subject lines, and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall [CPG 2.M].\nInstall a web application firewall and configure with appropriate rules to protect enterprise assets.\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Isolate web-facing applications to further minimize the spread of ransomware across a network [CPG 2.F].\nFollow the least-privilege best practice by requiring administrators to use administrative accounts for managing systems and use simple user accounts for non-administrative tasks [CPG 2.E].\nEnforce the management of and audit user accounts with administrative privileges. Configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege [CPG 2.E].\u00a0\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.\nKeep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Public-facing applications must be patched in a timely manner as vulnerabilities can often be exploited directly by the threat actor. By closely monitoring the threat landscape, threat actors often take advantage of vulnerabilities before systems are patched. Organizations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to 48 hours from when a vulnerability is disclosed. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems [CPG 1.E].\nRestrict service accounts from remotely accessing other systems. Configure group policy to Deny log on locally, Deny log on through Terminal Services, and Deny access to this computer from the network for all service accounts to limit the ability for compromised service accounts to be used for lateral movement.\nBlock direct internet access for administration interfaces (e.g., application protocol interface (API)) and for remote access.\nRequire phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and privileged accounts that access critical systems [CPG 2.H].\nConsolidate, monitor, and defend internet gateways.\nInstall, regularly update, and enable real-time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.\nRaise awareness for phishing threats in your organization. Phishing is one of the primary infection vectors in ransomware campaigns, and all employees should receive practical training on the risks associated with the regular use of\u00a0 email. With the rise of sophisticated phishing methods, such as using stolen email communication or artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT, the distinction between legitimate and malicious emails becomes more complex. This particularly applies to employees from corporate divisions that have to deal with a high volume of external email communication (e.g., staff recruitment) [CPG 2.I, 2.J].\nConsider adding an external email warning banner for emails sent to or received from outside of your organization [CPG 2.M].\nReview internet-facing services and disable any services that are no longer a business requirement to be exposed or restrict access to only those users with an explicit requirement to access services, such as SSL, VPN, or RDP. If internet-facing services must be used, control access by only allowing access from an admin IP range [CPG 2.X].\n\u00a0Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or unrecognized accounts.\nRegularly verify the security level of the Active Directory domain by checking for misconfigurations.\n\nExecution\n\nDevelop and regularly update comprehensive network diagram(s) that describes systems and data flows within your organization\u2019s network(s) [CPG 2.P].\nControl and restrict network connections accordingly with a network flow matrix.\nEnable enhanced PowerShell logging [CPG 2.T, 2.U].\n\nPowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS, registry interaction, and possibility of a threat actor\u2019s PowerShell use.\nEnsure PowerShell instances are configured to use the latest version, and have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).\nThe two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log and the PowerShell Operational Log. It is recommended to turn on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as reasonably practical.\n\n\nConfigure the Windows Registry to require UAC approval for any PsExec operations requiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally [CPG 2.N].\nEnable Credential Guard to protect your Windows system credentials. This is enabled by default on Windows 11 Enterprise 22H2 and Windows 11 Education 22H2. Credential Guard prevents credential dumping techniques of the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. Be aware that enabling this security control has some downsides. In particular, you can no longer use New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM) classic authentication single sign-on, Kerberos unconstrained delegation, as well as Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption.\nImplement Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) where possible if your OS is older than Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 as these versions do not have LAPS built in. NOTE: The authoring organizations recommend organizations upgrade to Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 or greater.\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nApply local security policies to control application execution (e.g., Software Restriction Policies (SRP), AppLocker, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)) with a strict allowlist.\nEstablish an application allowlist of approved software applications and binaries that are allowed to be executed on a system. This measure prevents unwanted software to be run. Usually, application allowlist software can also be used to define blocklists so that the execution of certain programs can be blocked, for example cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe [CPG 2.Q].\n\nCredential Access\n\nRestrict NTLM uses with security policies and firewalling.\n\nDiscovery\n\nDisable unused ports. Disable ports that are not being used for business purposes (e.g., RDP-TCP Port 3389). Close unused RDP ports.\n\nLateral Movement\n\nIdentify Active Directory control paths and eliminate the most critical among them according to the business needs and assets.\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network [CPG 1.E]. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\n\nCommand and Control\n\nImplement a tiering model by creating trust zones dedicated to an organization\u2019s most sensitive assets.\nVPN access should not be considered as a trusted network zone. Organizations should instead consider moving to zero trust architectures.\n\nExfiltration\n\nBlock connections to known malicious systems by using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) Proxy. Malware often uses TLS to communicate with the infrastructure of the threat actor. By using feeds for known malicious systems, the establishment of a connection to a C2 server can be prevented.\nUse web filtering or a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) to restrict or monitor access to public-file sharing services that may be used to exfiltrate data from a network.\n\nImpact\n\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud) [CPG 2.R].\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at the minimum). By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data [CPG 2.R]. ACSC recommends organizations follow the 3-2-1 backup strategy in which organizations have three copies of data (one copy of production data and two backup copies) on two different media, such as disk and tape, with one copy kept off-site for disaster recovery.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K, 2.R].\n\nImplement Mitigations for Defense-in-Depth\nImplementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it by applying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond to ransomware before an organization\u2019s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack vectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in this advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack is broken into three phases:\n\nInitial Access where the cyber actor is looking for a way into a network.\nConsolidation and Preparation when the actor is attempting to gain access to all devices.\nImpact on Target where the actor is able to steal and encrypt data and then demand ransom.\n\nFigure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop a ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data. In the Initial Access phase, mitigations working together to deny an attacker network access include securing internet-exposed services, patching devices, implementing MFA, disabling macros, employing application allowlisting, and using logging and alerting. In the Consolidation and Preparation phase, mitigations working together to keep an attacker from accessing network devices are patching devices, using network segmentation, enforcing the principle of least privilege, implementing MFA, and using logging and alerting. Finally, in the Impact on Target phase, mitigations working together to deny or degrade an attacker\u2019s ability to steal and/or encrypt data includes using logging and alerting, using and maintaining backups, and employing application allowlisting.\n\n \n\n\n Critical Controls Key\n\n \n\n\nFigure 3: Stopping Ransomware Using Layered Mitigations\nValidate Security Controls\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory.
