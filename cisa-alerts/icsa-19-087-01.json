EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: PowerFlex 525 AC Drives\nVulnerability: Resource Exhaustion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in resource exhaustion, denial of service, and/or memory corruption.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PowerFlex 525, an AC drive, are affected:\n\nPowerFlex 525 AC Drives with embedded EtherNet/IP and Safety Versions 5.001 and earlier.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION ('RESOURCE EXHAUSTION') CWE-400\nA remote, unauthenticated threat actor can repeatedly send specific CIP packets to an affected PowerFlex 525 drive, which may allow disruption of the availability of the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-19282 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNicolas Merle of Applied Risk reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released new firmware to address the vulnerability. Download the latest version of the firmware from:\nhttps://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=25B&crumb=112\nRockwell Automation recommends the following general security guidelines:\n\nUtilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure CIP messages from unauthorized sources are blocked.\nBlock all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port 2222 and Port 44818, using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270 (login required).\nIf applicable, consult the product documentation for specific features, such as a hardware key-switch setting, which may be used to block unauthorized changes, etc.\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs, and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet or the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nRockwell Automation has released a security advisory regarding this vulnerability, which can be found on its website at the following location (login required): \u00a0https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1082684\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
