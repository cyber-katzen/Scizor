[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryMedtronic NGP 600 Series Insulin Pumps====================================== Last Revised September 21, 2022 Alert Code ICSMA\\-22\\-263\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 4\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable from an adjacent network* **Vendor:**  Medtronic* **Equipment:**  MiniMed 600 Series Insulin Pumps* **Vulnerability:**  Protection Mechanism Failure2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user to deliver too much or too little insulin through delivery of an unintended insulin bolus or because insulin delivery is slowed or stopped.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of the Medtronic NGP 600 Series Insulin Pumps and accessory components are affected:* MiniMed 620G: MMT\\-1710* MiniMed 630G: MMT\\-1715, MMT\\-1754, MMT\\-1755* MiniMed 640G: MMT\\-1711, MMT\\-1712, MMT\\-1751, MMT\\-1752* MiniMed 670G: MMT\\-1740, MMT\\-1741, MMT\\-1742, MMT\\-1760, MMT\\-1762, MMT\\-1762, MMT\\-1780, MMT\\-1781, MMT\\-1782### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [PROTECTION MECHANISM FAILURE CWE\\-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html) A vulnerability exists which could allow an unauthorized user to learn aspects of the communication protocol used to pair system components while the pump is being paired with other system components. Exploitation requires nearby wireless signal proximity with the patient and the device; advanced technical knowledge is required for exploitation.[CVE\\-2022\\-32537](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-32537)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Medtronic internally identified and reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Medtronic recommends users to take the following actions:1. Turn off the \"Remote Bolus\" feature on the pump.2. Only connect or link devices in a private place. Note: Turning off the remote bolus feature will ensure no remote bolus is possible. Medtronic has identified the following precautions to assist users:* Ensure the pump and connected system components are always controlled by an authorized user.* Be attentive to pump notifications, alarms, and alerts.* Immediately cancel any boluses not initiated by authorized personnel; monitor blood glucose levels closely and reach out to Medtronic 24\\-Hour Technical Support to report the bolus.* Disconnect the USB device from the computer when not downloading pump data.* Users should not confirm remote connection requests or any other remote action on the pump screen unless it is initiated by authorized care personnel.* Avoid sharing pump or device serial numbers with anyone other than the healthcare provider, distributors, and Medtronic.* Users should not accept, calibrate, or bolus using a blood glucose reading not initiated by authorized care personnel.* Users should not connect to or allow any third\\-party devices to connect to the pump* Do not use software not authorized by Medtronic as being safe for use with the pump.* Medtronic advises patients experiencing symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis to seek immediate medical attention.* Users are encouraged to reach out to Medtronic 24\\-Hour Technical Support (1\\-800\\-646\\-4633\\) if they suspect a pump setting or insulin delivery have changed unexpectedly, without proper knowledge.
