This advisory provides mitigation details for multiple vulnerabilities that affect the GE Intelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal.\nResearcher Kuang-Chun Hung of Information and Communication Security Technology Center (ICST) identified multiple vulnerabilities in GE\u2019s Intelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal. Three improper input validation vulnerabilities could lead to a possible denial of service (DoS). GE has released patches that fix the vulnerabilities in Versions 3.5 SP1, 3.5, and 3.0 SP1. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could affect multiple sectors worldwide.\nThese vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GE product versions are affected:\n\nIntelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v2.6,\nIntelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v3.0,\nIntelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v3.0 SP1,\nIntelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v3.5, and\nIntelligent Platforms Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v3.5 SP1.\n\nNote: These vulnerabilities do not affect versions of Proficy Real-Time Information Portal v2.5 and earlier.\nIMPACT\nBy successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers could initiate a DoS or possible remote code execution in the Remote Interface Service. These could affect the availability of the system. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to GE, Proficy Real-Time Information Portal is a Web-based data visualization and reporting tool that is deployed across multiple industries worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nThree improper input validation\u00a0vulnerabilities have been identified\u00a0in the Remote Interface Service that operates on Port 5159/TCP.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nImproper Input ValidationCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, CWE-20: Improper Input Validation, Web site last accessed October 15, 2012.\nThese vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending additional data into the buffer, which is not properly checked as input data by the service. As a result, an attacker can cause a crash of the system leading to a DoS condition.\nCVE-2012-3010,NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3010 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0CVE-2012-3021,NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3021, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0and CVE-2012-3026NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3026 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?name=&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C&version=2\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a high skill level could exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nGE has released a security advisory and\u00a0patches\u00a0that fix the vulnerabilities in Versions 3.5 SP1, 3.5, and 3.0 SP1. The currently available patches can be found at GE\u2019s Intelligent Platforms Software Download Web Sites listed below:\n\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal 3.5 SP1 SIM 1\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal 3.5 SIM 17\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal 3.0 SP1 SIM 44\n\nNote: Proficy SIMs are cumulative. All future SIMs will include these updates.\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal customers using Versions 3.0 and 2.6 are encouraged to upgrade to one of the versions described above and apply the appropriate product update.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nInstall control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving\u00a0Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks.\n\nDo not click Web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
