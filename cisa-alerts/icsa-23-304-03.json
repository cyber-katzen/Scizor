While processing XML elements from incoming network requests, the product does not sufficiently check or validate allocated buffer size. This may lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-3959\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow CWE-121\nZavio IP Cameras CF7500, CF7300, CF7201, CF7501, CB3211, CB3212, CB5220, CB6231, B8520, B8220, CD321 with firmware version M2.1.6.05 are vulnerable to multiple instances of stack-based overflows. While parsing certain XML elements from incoming network requests, the product does not sufficiently check or validate allocated buffer size. This may lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-45225\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow CWE-121\nZavio IP Cameras CF7500, CF7300, CF7201, CF7501, CB3211, CB3212, CB5220, CB6231, B8520, B8220, CD321 with firmware version M2.1.6.05 are vulnerable to multiple instances of stack-based overflows. During the processing and parsing of certain fields in XML elements from incoming network requests, the product does not sufficiently check or validate allocated buffer size. This may lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-43755\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow CWE-121\nZavio IP Cameras CF7500, CF7300, CF7201, CF7501, CB3211, CB3212, CB5220, CB6231, B8520, B8220, CD321 with firmware version M2.1.6.05 are vulnerable to stack-based overflows. During the process of updating certain settings sent from incoming network requests, the product does not sufficiently check or validate allocated buffer size. This may lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2023-39435\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') CWE-78\nZavio IP Cameras CF7500, CF7300, CF7201, CF7501, CB3211, CB3212, CB5220, CB6231, B8520, B8220, CD321 with firmware version M2.1.6.05 has a command injection vulnerability in their implementation of their binaries and handling of network requests.\nCVE-2023-4249\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAttila Szasz of BugProve reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. Mike Haldas of CCTV Camera Pros assisted in the coordination of these vulnerabilities with CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe affected products are end-of-life and have been identified to contain many insecurities. The vendor, Zavio, is no longer actively in business and therefore development for firmware fixes, mitigations, and updates are not available and will not become available. CISA recommends users discontinue use of the product.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
