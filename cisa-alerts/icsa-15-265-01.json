Resource Data Management has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nResource Data Management reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of Data Manager:\n\nVersions prior to 2.2\n\nIMPACT\nPrivilege escalation allows an attacker to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. This includes altering logs and parameters.\nA cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack may allow the web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nResource Data Management is a UK-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US and Asia.\nThe affected product, Data Manager, is a web-based SCADA monitoring system. According to Resource Data Management, Data Manager is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Healthcare and Public Health, and Information Technology. Resource Data Management estimates that these products are used primarily in the US, UK, and in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPRIVILEGE ESCALATIONCWE-269:Improper Privilege Management, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html, web site last accessed September 22, 2015.\n\nA valid user can change the password for any other user, including administrators, to increase their privileges on the system.\nCVE-2015-6470NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-6470, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed September 22, 2015.\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERYCWE-352:Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html, web site last accessed September 22, 2015.\n\nA CSRF attack occurs when a malicious program causes a web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.\nCVE-2015-6468NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-6468, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, web site last accessed September 22, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nResource Data Management has developed Data Manager 2.2 that fixes both these vulnerabilities.\nCustomers can download Version 2.2 at:\nhttps://www.resourcedm.com/en-us/Support/Download-Software.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
