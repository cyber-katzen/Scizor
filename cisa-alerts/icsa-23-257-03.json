TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nQMS Automotive: All versions prior to v12.39\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE-256\nUser credentials are stored in plaintext in the database without any hashing mechanism. This could allow an attacker to gain access to credentials and impersonate other users.\nCVE-2022-43958\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN MEMORY CWE-316\nUser credentials are found in memory as plaintext. An attacker could perform a memory dump, and get access to credentials, and use it for impersonation.\nCVE-2023-40724\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0GENERATION OF ERROR MESSAGE CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-209\nThe affected application returns inconsistent error messages in response to invalid user credentials during login session. This allows an attacker to enumerate usernames, and identify valid usernames.\nCVE-2023-40725\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0SERVER-GENERATED ERROR MESSAGE CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-550\nThe affected application server responds with sensitive information about the server. This could allow an attacker to directly access the database.\nCVE-2023-40726\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE-347\nThe QMS.Mobile module of the affected application uses weak outdated application signing mechanism. This could allow an attacker to tamper the application code.\nCVE-2023-40727\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0INSECURE STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-922\nThe QMS.Mobile module of the affected application stores sensitive application data in an external insecure storage. This could allow an attacker to alter content, leading to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-40728\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.7\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected application lacks security control to prevent unencrypted communication without HTTPS. An attacker who managed to gain machine-in-the-middle position could manipulate, or steal confidential information.\nCVE-2023-40729\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe QMS.Mobile module of the affected application lacks sufficient authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to access confidential information, perform administrative functions, or lead to a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-40730\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.9\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThe affected application allows users to upload arbitrary file types. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files, that could potentially lead to code tampering.\nCVE-2023-40731\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.10\u00a0INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATION CWE-613\nThe QMS.Mobile module of the affected application does not invalidate the session token on logout. This could allow an attacker to perform session hijacking attacks.\nCVE-2023-40732\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nQMS Automotive: Update to V12.39 or later version. The patch is available upon request from customer support.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-147266 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
