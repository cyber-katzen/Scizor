MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends upgrading their products to the latest version:* SCALANCE W1750D: [Update to v8\\.7\\.1\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109802805)  or later.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE W1750D: [Update to v8\\.7\\.1\\.9](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109813747)  or later**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Block access to the Aruba Instant Command Line Interface from all untrusted users.* Block access to the Aruba Instant web\\-based management interface from all untrusted users.* Enable the Enhanced PAPI Security feature, where available, to prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities. For assistance from the Siemens Technical Assistance Center (TAC), please [contact Siemens](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/signin)  (login required).* Block access for Aruba Instant device on Port UDP/8211 from all untrusted users. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-917476 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-917476.html)  or [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-917476.json)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
