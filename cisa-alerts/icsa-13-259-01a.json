This advisory provides mitigation details for multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Emerson Process Management\u2019s ROC800 remote terminal units (RTUs) products (ROC800, ROC800L, and DL8000\\).### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Researchers Dillon Beresford, Brian Meixell, Marc Ayala, and Eric Forner, formerly of Cimation, have identified multiple vulnerabilities in Emerson Process Management\u2019s ROC800 RTU products. Emerson Process Management has produced a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The researchers have tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities being patched.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Emerson Process Management RTUs are affected:* ROC800 Version 3\\.50 and prior,* DL8000 Version 2\\.30 and prior, and* ROC800L Version 1\\.20 and prior.IMPACT------ An attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities could disable the device, compromise the device integrity, and remotely execute code on the target system. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Emerson Process Management is a global manufacturing and technology company offering multiple products and services in the industrial, commercial, and consumer markets through its network power, process management, industrial automation, climate technologies, and tools and storage businesses. The affected product, the ROC800 RTU, can perform many PLC\\-like functions for controlling devices. It is widely used in oil and gas pipelines, but can also be used as a general purpose controller in other applications. Emerson Process Management estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITY CWE\\-912: Hidden Functionality, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/912\\.html, web site last accessed September 26, 2013\\. In the case of the ROC800 RTU, there are three separate hidden functionality vulnerabilities that are described below. Each of these hidden capabilities increases the attack surface for the device and can be exploited by an attacker.### OSE DEBUG BROADCAST The ROC800 RTU runs the ENEA OSE operating system. The kernel running on the ROC800 device broadcasts a network beacon allowing easier detection of the OSE Debug vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. CVE\\-2013\\-0693 NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-0693, web site last accessed December 02, 2014\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The Emerson Process Management patch is available via the following web link of which a user name and password is required:[http://www3\\.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/support\\_login.html](http://www3.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/support_login.html) ### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Emerson has identified and verified that a third\\-party secure router, the Moxa EDR\\-810, mitigates the identified vulnerabilities when used in combination with the ROC800 platform. Emerson asserts that by adding the EDR\\-810 between the host and the field device it is virtually impossible for an attacker to eavesdrop on communications or falsify commands. The EDR\\-810 is a highly integrated industrial multiport secure router with Firewall/NAT/VPN. The compatibility of the EDR\\-810 with the ROC800 platform has been tested and verified by Emerson Remote Automation Solutions. Emerson has determined that the EDR\\-810 is suitable for field installation. The EDR\\-810 uses IPSec server or client mode for encryption and authentication of all IP packets at the network layer to ensure confidentiality and sender authentication. Additional information about the Moxa EDR\\-810 secure router is available at the following location:[http://www.moxa.com/product/EDR\\-810\\.htm](http://www.moxa.com/product/EDR-810.htm) ### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
