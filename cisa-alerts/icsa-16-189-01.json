WECON has not released a product fix to addresses the buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the LeviStudio software.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following LeviStudio versions are affected:\n\nLeviStudio, all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nWECON is a China-based company.\nThe affected product, LeviStudio, is an HMI programming software. According to WECON, LeviStudio is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, and Energy. WECON estimates that this product is primarily used in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nHEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html, web site last accessed July 07, 2016.\n\nSpecific flaws in the handling of some files may allow an attacker to cause a heap-based buffer overflow and execute code in the context of the running process.\nCVE-2016-4533NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4533, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed July 07, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malformed file or visits a malicious web site.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities. Crafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would not be difficult; however, social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed file or visit a malicious web site. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nWECON has not released a product fix to address the buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the LeviStudio software. WECON has indicated that they are planning to release a product fix; however, a definitive release date has not been established.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure that untrusted files are not uploaded or run without verifying the integrity of files.\nInteract with and only obtain files, software, and software patches from trustworthy highly reputable sources.\nLimit access to those assets using the LeviStudio software to authorized personnel.\nEnsure that employees with access to the LeviStudio software are fully aware of the ongoing potential for social engineering attacks and are trained to identify and avoid social engineering attacks.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed July 7, 2016. for more information on avoiding email scams.\n\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed July 7, 2016. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n",
