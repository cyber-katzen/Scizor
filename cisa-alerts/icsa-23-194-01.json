This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response. This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations without TLS contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2021\\-22946](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22946) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2 \u200b\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bThe c\\_rehash script does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-1292](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1292) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3 \u200b\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bIn addition to the c\\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE\\-2022\\-1292, further circumstances where the c\\_rehash script does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE\\-2022\\-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-2068](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2068) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This affects SASL\\-enabled protocols: SMPTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-22576](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22576) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.5 \u200b\n [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)**\n\n\n\n\n \u200bRsyslog is a system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet\\-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. This vulnerability cannot be used for remote code execution, but there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum. This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stops, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet\\-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes enabled by default on receivers. Modules \\`imtcp\\`, \\`imptcp\\`, \\`imgssapi\\`, and \\`imhttp\\` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module \\`imdiag\\` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. Octet\\-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n \n\n\n\n \u200b\n [CVE\\-2022\\-24903](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24903) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
