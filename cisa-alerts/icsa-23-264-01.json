EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Real Time Automation\nEquipment: 460MCBS\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to run malicious JavaScript content, resulting in cross site scripting (XSS).\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Real Time Automation products are affected:\n\n460 Series: Versions prior to v8.9.8\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nReal Time Automation 460 Series products with versions prior to v8.9.8 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting, which could allow an attacker to run any JavaScript reference from the URL string. If this were to occur, the gateway's HTTP interface would redirect to the main page, which is index.htm.\nCVE-2023-4523\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered public proof of concept as authored by Yehia Elghaly.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nReal Time Automation recommends users download and apply the new version of their product. To update the software,\u00a0contact Real Time Automation\u00a0directly for assistance.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
