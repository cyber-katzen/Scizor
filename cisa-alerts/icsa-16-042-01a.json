Moxa has produced a new firmware version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Moxa Secure Routers are affected:\n\nEDR-G903 Versions V3.4.11 and older.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to escalate privileges, initiate a denial-of-service condition, and execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMoxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.\nThe affected product, Moxa EDR-G903 series, is an industrial virtual private network (VPN) server with firewall/NAT all-in-one secure router. It is designed for Ethernet security applications in sensitive remote control or monitoring networks, According to Moxa, these secure routers are deployed across several sectors, including, Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Emergency Services, Energy, and others. Moxa estimates that these products are used globally but concentrated in the US, Europe, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Columbia, and Taiwan; 50 to 60 percent of all sales are in the US.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPRIVILEGE ESCALATIONCWE-284: Improper Access Control, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html, web site last accessed May 17, 2016.\n\nBy accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL) on the web server, a malicious user is able to access configuration and log files.\nCVE-2016-0875NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0875, web site last accessed December 22, 2016. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as VPNs, recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
