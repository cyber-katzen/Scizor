EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: FactoryTalk Service Platform\nVulnerability: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve user information and modify settings without any authentication.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Rockwell Automation products are affected:\n\nFactoryTalk Service Platform: Versions prior to v6.4\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE-347\nA vulnerability exists in the affected product that allows a malicious user to obtain the service token and use it for authentication on another FTSP directory. This is due to the lack of digital signing between the FTSP service token and directory. If exploited, a malicious user could potentially retrieve user information and modify settings without any authentication.\nCVE-2024-21917\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell recommends the following:\n\nSet DCOM authentication level to 6, which enables encryption of the service token and communication channel between the server and client. Please refer to\u00a0Mitigating Microsoft DCOM Hardening Patch (CVE-2021-26414) for Affected Rockwell Automation Products (custhelp.com)\nWhen it is not possible to update to v6.40 or later, enable verification of the publisher information (i.e., digital signature) of any executable attempting to use the FactoryTalk Services APIs. This helps prevent a malicious user from calling the API to receive the service token. This setting can be changed from the Application Authorization node located within System Policies using the FactoryTalk\u00ae Administration Console application.\nSecurity Best Practices\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
