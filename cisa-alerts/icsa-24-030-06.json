[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRockwell Automation FactoryTalk Service Platform================================================ Release Date January 30, 2024 Alert Code ICSA\\-24\\-030\\-06**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Rockwell Automation* **Equipment**  : FactoryTalk Service Platform* **Vulnerability**  : Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve user information and modify settings without any authentication.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Rockwell Automation products are affected:* FactoryTalk Service Platform: Versions prior to v6\\.4### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE\\-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)** A vulnerability exists in the affected product that allows a malicious user to obtain the service token and use it for authentication on another FTSP directory. This is due to the lack of digital signing between the FTSP service token and directory. If exploited, a malicious user could potentially retrieve user information and modify settings without any authentication.[CVE\\-2024\\-21917](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21917)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell recommends the following:* Set DCOM authentication level to 6, which enables encryption of the service token and communication channel between the server and client. Please refer to [Mitigating Microsoft DCOM Hardening Patch (CVE\\-2021\\-26414\\) for Affected Rockwell Automation Products (custhelp.com)](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1134040)* When it is not possible to update to v6\\.40 or later, enable verification of the publisher information (i.e., digital signature) of any executable attempting to use the FactoryTalk Services APIs. This helps prevent a malicious user from calling the API to receive the service token. This setting can be changed from the Application Authorization node located within System Policies using the FactoryTalk\u00ae Administration Console application.* [Security Best Practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US) CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
