MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi ABB Power Grids recommends users update to Version 6\\.3\\.1 or later. Hitachi ABB Power Grids also recommends implementing security best practices and firewall configurations, which help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include:* Ensuring critical applications and systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall.* Firewalls should be configured to have the minimum number of ports exposed and open ports should be justified and documented.* Critical systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.* It is important to implement robust security awareness training to ensure users can identify common attacks or content such as phishing emails or malicious webpages.
