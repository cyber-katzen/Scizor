A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been detected in exploits in the wild. The vulnerability affects the following appliances:* Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 10\\.5 \u2013 all supported builds before 10\\.5\\.70\\.12* Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 11\\.1 \u2013 all supported builds before 11\\.1\\.63\\.15* Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12\\.0 \u2013 all supported builds before 12\\.0\\.63\\.13* Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12\\.1 \u2013 all supported builds before 12\\.1\\.55\\.18* Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version 13\\.0 \u2013 all supported builds before 13\\.0\\.47\\.24* Citrix SD\\-WAN WANOP appliance models 4000\\-WO, 4100\\-WO, 5000\\-WO, and 5100\\-WO\u00a0\u2013 all supported software release builds before 10\\.2\\.6b and 11\\.0\\.3b. (Citrix SD\\-WAN WANOP is vulnerable because it packages Citrix ADC as a load balancer).#### Detection Measures Citrix and FireEye Mandiant released an [IOC scanning tool for CVE\\-2019\\-19781](https://github.com/citrix/ioc-scanner-CVE-2019-19781/)  on January 22, 2020\\. The tool aids customers with detecting potential IOCs based on known attacks and exploits.

[\\[15]](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/01/13/cisa-releases-test-citrix-adc-and-gateway-vulnerability)  CISA encourages administrators to visit CISA\u2019s [GitHub page](https://github.com/cisagov/check-cve-2019-19781)  to download and run the tool.### Mitigations CISA strongly recommends users and administrators update Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD\\-WAN WANOP as soon as possible. The fixed builds can be downloaded from Citrix Downloads pages for [Citrix ADC](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-adc/)  , [Citrix Gateway](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-gateway/)  , and [Citrix SD\\-WAN](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-sd-wan/)  . Until the appropriate update is implemented, users and administrators should apply Citrix\u2019s interim mitigation steps for CVE\\-2019\\-19781\\. [\\[16]](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679)  Verify the successful application of the above mitigations by using the tool in [CTX269180 \u2013 CVE\\-2019\\-19781 \u2013 Verification ToolTest](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX269180)  . **Note:**  these mitigation steps apply to Citrix ADC and SD\\-WAN WANOP deployments.
