A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been detected in exploits in the wild.\nThe vulnerability affects the following appliances:\n\nCitrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 10.5 \u2013 all supported builds before 10.5.70.12\nCitrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 11.1 \u2013 all supported builds before 11.1.63.15\nCitrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.0 \u2013 all supported builds before 12.0.63.13\nCitrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1 \u2013 all supported builds before 12.1.55.18\nCitrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version 13.0 \u2013 all supported builds before 13.0.47.24\nCitrix SD-WAN WANOP appliance models 4000-WO, 4100-WO, 5000-WO, and 5100-WO\u00a0\u2013 all supported software release builds before 10.2.6b and 11.0.3b. (Citrix SD-WAN WANOP is vulnerable because it packages Citrix ADC as a load balancer).\n\nDetection Measures\nCitrix and FireEye Mandiant released an IOC scanning tool for CVE-2019-19781 on January 22, 2020. The tool aids customers with detecting potential IOCs based on known attacks and exploits.[13]\nSee the National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Advisory on CVE-2019-19781 for other detection measures.[14]\nCISA released a utility that enables users and administrators to detect whether their Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway firmware is susceptible to CVE-2019-19781.[15] CISA encourages administrators to visit CISA\u2019s GitHub page to download and run the tool.\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA strongly recommends users and administrators update Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP as soon as possible.\nThe fixed builds can be downloaded from Citrix Downloads pages for Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN.\nUntil the appropriate update is implemented, users and administrators should apply Citrix\u2019s interim mitigation steps for CVE-2019-19781.[16] Verify the successful application of the above mitigations by using the tool in CTX269180 \u2013 CVE-2019-19781 \u2013 Verification ToolTest. Note: these mitigation steps apply to Citrix ADC and SD-WAN WANOP deployments.[17]\nRefer to table 1 for Citrix\u2019s fix schedule.[18]\nTable 1.

Use of a proprietary SSLVPN/TLSVPN is discouraged.\u201d\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Citrix blog: Citrix releases final fixes for CVE-2019-19781\n[2] Citrix Security Bulletin CTX267027, Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway \n[3] United Kingdom National Cyber Secrity Centre (NCSC) Alert: Actors exploiting Citrix products vulnerability \n[4] CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU#619785 \n[5] CISA Current Activity: Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway Vulnerability \n[6] NSA Cybersecurity Advisory: Mitigate CVE-2019-19781: Critical Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway \n[7] Citrix blog: Citrix provides update on Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway vulnerability \n[8] CISA Current Activity: CISA Releases Test for Citrix ADC and Gateway Vulnerability GitHub: CISAgov \u2013 check-cve-2019-19781 \n[9] Citrix Blog: Vulnerability Update: First permanent fixes available, timeline accelerated \n[10] Citrix Blog: Update on CVE-2019-19781: Fixes now available for Citrix SD-WAN WANOP\n[11] Citrix Blog: Citrix and FireEye Mandiant share forensic tool for CVE-2019-19781\n[12] Citrix Blog: Fixes now available for Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway versions 12.1 and 13.0\n[13] Citrix Blog: Citrix and FireEye Mandiant share forensic tool for CVE-2019-19781\n[14] NSA Cybersecurity Advisory: Mitigate CVE-2019-19781: Critical Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway \n[15] CISA Current Activity: CISA Releases Test for Citrix ADC and Gateway Vulnerability GitHub: CISAgov \u2013 check-cve-2019-19781 \n[16] Citrix Security Bulletin CTX267679, Mitigation Steps for CVE-2019-19781 \n[17] Citrix Security Bulletin CTX267027, Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway \n[18] Citrix Security Bulletin CTX267027, Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway \n\nRevisions\n\nJanuary 20, 2020: Initial Version|January 23, 2020: Updated with information about Citrix releasing fixes for SD-WAN WANOP appliances and an IOC scanning tool|January 24, 2020: Updated with information about Citrix releasing fixes for Citrix ADC and Gateway versions 10.5, 12.1, and 13.0|January 27, 2020: Updated vulnernable versions of ADC and Gateway version 10.5\n",
