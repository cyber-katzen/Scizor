MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released the following knowledge base article 1073315:\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073315/ (login required)\nCisco has released new Snort Rules at https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-03-29-new.html to help address the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2018-0171 - Snort Rule 46096 and 46097\nCVE-2018-0156 - Snort Rule 41725\nCVE-2018-0174 - Snort Rule 46120\nCVE-2018-0172 - Snort Rule 46104\nCVE-2018-0173 - Snort Rule 46119\n\nCisco adds the following notes for the Smart Install vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0171 and CVE-2018-0156):\n\nSmart Install is turned off by express setup; however, upgraded switches but not re-setup may have it enabled.\nDisable the Smart Install feature with the no vstack configuration command if it is not needed or once setup is complete.\nUsers who do use the feature\u2014and need to leave it enabled\u2014can use ACLs to block incoming traffic on TCP port 4786.\n\nCVE-2018-0155: Administrators who do not use the BFD feature in their environments can disable the BFD feature by using the feature bfd disable command in global configuration mode to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Administrators who do use the BFD feature can implement Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to allow processing of BFD packets from known BFD peers only and drop all other BFD traffic to limit exposure.\nCVE-2018-0167 and CVE-2018-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco advisory for more details:\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp\nRockwell Automation also recommends that users implement the following general security guidelines:\n\nHelp minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
