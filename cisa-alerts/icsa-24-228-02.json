EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: INTRALOG WMS\nVulnerabilities: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker located in the INTRALOG WMS network to decrypt and modify client-server communication, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the application servers.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of Siemens INTRALOG WMS, are affected:\n\nSiemens INTRALOG WMS: Versions prior to V4\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nMicrosoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data Provider Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nCVE-2024-0056 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-0056. A base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N).\n3.2.2 HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\n.NET and Visual Studio Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nCVE-2024-30045 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-30045. A base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nINTRALOG WMS: Update to V4 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-417547 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nAugust 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
