EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: TIM 1531 IRC\nVulnerability: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary administrative operations.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of TIM 1531 IRC\u2014a communication module for SIMATIC S7-1500, S7-400, and S7-300 with SINAUT ST7\u2014are affected:\n\nTIM 1531 IRC all versions prior to 2.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nWhen the product is configured it is missing proper authentication on Port 102/TCP, which could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary administrative operations.\nCVE-2018-13816 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends upgrading to firmware v2.0, which can be downloaded from the following link:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109762596\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nRestrict access to Port 102/TCP on TIM 1531 IRC to trusted IP addresses\nUpdate firmware to version v2.0 (and reload the TIM station from engineering)\n\nFor additional information see Siemens\u2019 security advisory SSA-982399 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/Industrialsecurity\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
