EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 6.9\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC\nVulnerability: Classic Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a local attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition in the runtime of the SCADA system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 and SIMATIC WinCC, a SCADA system, are affected:\n\nSiemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1: All versions before V9.1 SP2 UC04\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V17: All versions\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V18: All versions\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V19: All versions before V19 Update 1\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC V7.5: All versions before V7.5 SP2 Update 16\nSiemens SIMATIC WinCC V8.0: All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected products do not properly validate the input provided in the login dialog box. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a persistent denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-50821 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2023-50821. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAll affected products: Activate SIMATIC Logon in the User Administrator of the SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Stations\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V17: Currently no fix is available\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V18: Currently no fix is available\nSIMATIC WinCC V8.0: Currently no fix is available\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V19: Update to V19 Update 1 or later version\nSIMATIC WinCC V7.5: Update to V7.5 SP2 Update 16 or later version\nSIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1: Update to V9.1 SP2 UC04 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-730482 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nApril 11, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
