EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: EZSocket, FR Configurator2, GT Designer3 Version1(GOT1000), GT Designer3 Version1(GOT2000), GX Works2, GX Works3, MELSOFT Navigator, MT Works2, MX Component, MX OPC Server DA/UA (Software packaged with MC Works64)\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Unsafe Reflection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disclose, tamper with, destroy or delete information in the products, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the products.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Mitsubishi Electric FA Engineering Software Products, are affected:\n\nEZSocket: Versions 3.0 and later\nFR Configurator2: All versions\nGT Designer3 Version1(GOT1000): All versions\nGT Designer3 Version1(GOT2000): All versions\nGX Works2: Versions 1.11M and later\nGX Works3: All versions\nMELSOFT Navigator: Versions 1.04E and later\nMT Works2: All versions\nMX Component: Versions 4.00A and later\nMX OPC Server DA/UA (Software packaged with MC Works64): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nA remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to bypass authentication by sending specially crafted packets and connect to the products.\nCVE-2023-6942\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0USE OF EXTERNALLY-CONTROLLED INPUT TO SELECT CLASSES OR CODE ('UNSAFE REFLECTION') CWE-470\nAn attacker may be able to execute a malicious code by remotely calling a function with a path to a malicious library while connected to the products. As a result, unauthorized users may disclose, tamper with, destroy or delete information in the products, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the products.\nCVE-2023-6943\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nReid Wightman of Dragos reported these vulnerabilities to Mitsubishi Electric.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:\n\nWhen connecting your personal computer with the affected products to the internet, use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc., to prevent unauthorized access and allow only trusted users to remote login.\nUse your personal computer with the affected products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.\nRestrict physical access to your computer using the affected products as well as to the personal computers and network devices that can communicate with it.\nInstall antivirus software on your personal computer using the affected products and on the personal computers that can communicate with it.\nDon't open untrusted files or click untrusted links.\n\nFor more information, see Mitsubishi Electric's\u00a0security advisory.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
