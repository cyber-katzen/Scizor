MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:* When connecting your personal computer with the affected products to the internet, use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc., to prevent unauthorized access and allow only trusted users to remote login.* Use your personal computer with the affected products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.* Restrict physical access to your computer using the affected products as well as to the personal computers and network devices that can communicate with it.* Install antivirus software on your personal computer using the affected products and on the personal computers that can communicate with it.* Don't open untrusted files or click untrusted links. For more information, see Mitsubishi Electric's [security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2023-020_en.pdf)  . CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
