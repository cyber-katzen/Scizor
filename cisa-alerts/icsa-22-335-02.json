[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHorner Automation Remote Compact Controller=========================================== Last Revised December 01, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-335\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Horner Automation* **Equipment:**  Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972* **Vulnerabilities:**  Inadequate Encryption Strength, Use of Hard\\-coded Cryptographic Key, Excessive Reliance on Global Variables2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to the affected device and obtain complete control.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following version of Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972, an all\\-in\\-one I/O controller, is affected:* RCC 972: Firmware Version 15\\.40### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)** The Config\\-files of Horner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 with firmware version 15\\.40 are encrypted with weak XOR encryption vulnerable to reverse engineering. This could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to run services such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[CVE\\-2022\\-2640](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2640)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE\\-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)** Horner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 with firmware version 15\\.40 has a static encryption key on the device. This could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized changes to the device, remotely execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-2641](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2641)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [EXCESSIVE RELIANCE ON GLOBAL VARIABLES CWE\\-1108](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1108.html)** Horner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 firmware version 15\\.40 contains global variables. This could allow an attacker to read out sensitive values and variable keys from the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-2642](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2642)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER m1etz reported these vulnerabilities through the Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT\\-Bund, to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Horner Automation recommends that users update RCC 972 to the latest firmware available to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:* RCC 972: Update to [Firmware Version 15\\.60 or later](https://hornerautomation.com/controller-firmware-cscan/) CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
