EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Horner Automation\nEquipment: Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Inadequate Encryption Strength, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Excessive Reliance on Global Variables\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to the affected device and obtain complete control.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972, an all-in-one I/O controller, is affected:\u00a0\n\nRCC 972: Firmware Version 15.40\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\u00a0\nThe Config-files of Horner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 with firmware version 15.40 are encrypted with weak XOR encryption vulnerable to reverse engineering. This could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to run services such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2640 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2 USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\u00a0\nHorner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 with firmware version 15.40 has a static encryption key on the device. This could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized changes to the device, remotely execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2641 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3 EXCESSIVE RELIANCE ON GLOBAL VARIABLES CWE-1108\u00a0\nHorner Automation\u2019s RCC 972 firmware version 15.40 contains global variables. This could allow an attacker to read out sensitive values and variable keys from the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2642 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nm1etz reported these vulnerabilities through the Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-Bund, to CISA. \u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHorner Automation recommends that users update RCC 972 to the latest firmware available to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\nRCC 972: Update to Firmware Version 15.60 or later\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
