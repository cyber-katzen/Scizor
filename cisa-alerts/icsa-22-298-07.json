RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code, cause a denial-of-service condition by remotely deleting files or changing group privileges, or remotely read and write files, all with local administrator privileges.\u00a0\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of InfraSuite Device Master, a real-time device monitoring software, are affected:\u00a0\n\nVersion 00.00.01a and prior\u00a0\n\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nInfraSuite Device Master: Versions prior to 1.0.3 (CVE-2022-41657 and CVE-2022-40202 only)\n\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1 DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior deserialize user-supplied data provided through the Device-DataCollect service port without proper verification. An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41778 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.2 DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior deserialize user-supplied data provided through the Device-Gateway service port without proper verification. An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-38142 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.3 DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior deserialize network packets without proper verification. If the device connects to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker could send maliciously crafted packets that would be deserialized and executed, leading to remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41779 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.4 IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Versions 00.00.01a and prior allow attacker provided data already serialized into memory to be used in file operation application programmable interfaces (APIs). This could create arbitrary files, which could be used in API operations and could ultimately result in remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41657 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.5 IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Versions 00.00.01a and prior mishandle .ZIP archives containing characters used in path traversal. This path traversal could result in remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41772 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.6 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nThe database backup function in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Versions 00.00.01a and prior lacks proper authentication. An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects which, when deserialized, could activate an opcode for a backup scheduling function without authentication. This function allows the user to designate all function arguments and the file to be executed. This could allow the attacker to start any new process and achieve remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40202 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.7 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior lack proper authentication for functions that create and modify user groups. An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects that could run these functions without authentication to create a new user and add them to the administrator group.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41688 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.8 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior lacks authentication for a function that changes group privileges. An attacker could use this to create a denial-of-service state or escalate their own privileges.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41644 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.9 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior allow unauthenticated users to trigger the WriteConfiguration method, which could allow an attacker to provide new values for user configuration files such as UserListInfo.xml. This could lead to the changing of administrative passwords.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41776 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n4.2.10 MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nDelta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior allow unauthenticated users to access the aprunning endpoint, which could allow an attacker to retrieve any file from the \u201cRunningConfigs\u201d directory. The attacker could then view and modify configuration files such as UserListInfo.xml, which would allow them to see existing administrative passwords.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41629 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.
