MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Delta Electronics recommends users uninstall old versions of InfraSuite Device Master and reinstall the updated Version 1\\.0\\.3 [using the installer](https://datacenter-softwarecenter.deltaww.com/Download/UPS/Software/InfraSuite_Device_Master_1.0.3(x64).exe)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Delta Electronics also recommends users follow CISA\u2019s security recommendations. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
