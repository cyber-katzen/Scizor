EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 5.1\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SENTRON 7KM PAC3120, SENTRON 7KM PAC3220\nVulnerability: Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attacker to read out the data from the internal flash of affected device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens SENTRON 7KM PAC3120 and PAC3220, power measuring devices, are affected:\n\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3120 AC/DC (7KM3120-0BA01-1DA0): Versions V3.2.3 and after but before V3.3.0 only when manufactured between LQN231003... and LQN231215... (with LQNYYMMDD...)\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3120 DC (7KM3120-1BA01-1EA0): Versions V3.2.3 and after but before V3.3.0 only when manufactured between LQN231003... and\n\tLQN231215... (with LQNYYMMDD...)\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3220 AC/DC (7KM3220-0BA01-1DA0): Versions V3.2.3 and after but before V3.3.0 only when manufactured between LQN231003... and LQN231215... (with LQNYYMMDD...)\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3220 DC (7KM3220-1BA01-1EA0): Versions V3.2.3 and after but before V3.3.0 only when manufactured between LQN231003... and\n\tLQN231215... (with LQNYYMMDD...)\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe read out protection of the internal flash of affected devices was not properly set at the end of the\nmanufacturing process. An attacker with physical access to the device could read out the data.\nCVE-2024-21483\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-21483. A base score of 5.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3120 AC/DC (7KM3120-0BA01-1DA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3120 DC (7KM3120-1BA01-1EA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3220 AC/DC (7KM3220-0BA01-1DA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3220 DC (7KM3220-1BA01-1EA0): Restrict physical access to the device to trusted personnel.\nSENTRON 7KM PAC3120 AC/DC (7KM3120-0BA01-1DA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3120 DC (7KM3120-1BA01-1EA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3220 AC/DC (7KM3220-0BA01-1DA0), SENTRON 7KM PAC3220 DC (7KM3220-1BA01-1EA0): Update to\u00a0V3.3.0\u00a0or later version.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-792319 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nMarch 14, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
