EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Echelon\nEquipment: SmartServer 1, SmartServer 2, i.LON 100, i.LON 600\nVulnerabilities: Information Exposure, Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, Unprotected Storage of Credentials, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-18-200-03 Echelon SmartServer 1, SmartServer 2, SmartServer 3, i.LON 100, i.LON 600 that was published July 19, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution on the device.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Smart Server and i.LON products, which are network devices, are affected:\n\nSmartServer 1 all versions,\nSmartServer 2 all versions prior to release 4.11.007,\ni.LON 100 all versions, and\ni.LON 600 all versions.\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\nAn attacker can use the SOAP API to retrieve and change sensitive configuration items such as the usernames and passwords for the Web and FTP servers. This vulnerability does not affect the i.LON 600 product.\nCVE-2018-10627 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nAn attacker can bypass the required authentication specified in the security configuration file by including extra characters in the directory name when specifying the directory to be accessed.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nCVE-2018-8859 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNPROTECTED STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS CWE-256\nThe devices store passwords in plaintext, which may allow an attacker with access to the configuration file to log into the SmartServer web user interface.\nCVE-2018-8851 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe devices allow unencrypted Web connections by default, and devices can receive configuration and firmware updates by unsecure FTP.\nCVE-2018-8855 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nEchelon, working with Daniel Crowley and IBM\u2019s X-Force Red team, self-reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nFor CVE-2018-8859, Echelon recommends affected users install the i.LON 600 and any servers using the i.LON 600 behind a firewall or on a VLAN without other devices. For more information, see Echelon\u2019s security advisory at:\nhttps://www.echelon.com/static/company/security/security-advisories/ESA-20180823-01.pdf\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nEchelon recommends that affected users install SmartServer 2 Service Pack 7 (Version 4.11.007), to mitigate CVE-2018-8859, CVE-2018-8851, and CVE-2018-8855, which can be downloaded at the following link:\nhttps://www.echelon.com/software-downloads?ele=153-0608-01A\nThe following manual mitigation is also recommended:\nFor CVE-2018-10627, Echelon recommends affected users modify the WebParams.dat file.\nEchelon recommends that the following mitigation is implemented until SmartServer 2 Service Pack 7 is installed:\n\nAll SmartServer and i.LON 600 devices along with any servers using the SmartServer and i.Lon services should be installed behind a firewall or on a VLAN without other devices.\nChange the username and password during the initial installation of the affected products.\nDisable unencrypted services and secure encrypted services for the SmartServer or i.LON 100.\n\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
