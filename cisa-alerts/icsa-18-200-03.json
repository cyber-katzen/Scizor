MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For CVE\\-2018\\-8859, Echelon recommends affected users install the i.LON 600 and any servers using the i.LON 600 behind a firewall or on a VLAN without other devices. For more information, see Echelon\u2019s security advisory at:[https://www.echelon.com/static/company/security/security\\-advisories/ESA\\-20180823\\-01\\.pdf](https://www.echelon.com/static/company/security/security-advisories/ESA-20180823-01.pdf) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Echelon recommends that affected users install SmartServer 2 Service Pack 7 (Version 4\\.11\\.007\\), to mitigate CVE\\-2018\\-8859, CVE\\-2018\\-8851, and CVE\\-2018\\-8855, which can be downloaded at the following link:[https://www.echelon.com/software\\-downloads?ele\\=153\\-0608\\-01A](https://www.echelon.com/software-downloads?ele=153-0608-01A)  The following manual mitigation is also recommended: For CVE\\-2018\\-10627, Echelon recommends affected users modify the WebParams.dat file. Echelon recommends that the following mitigation is implemented until SmartServer 2 Service Pack 7 is installed:* All SmartServer and i.LON 600 devices along with any servers using the SmartServer and i.Lon services should be installed behind a firewall or on a VLAN without other devices.* Change the username and password during the initial installation of the affected products.* Disable unencrypted services and secure encrypted services for the SmartServer or i.LON 100\\. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
