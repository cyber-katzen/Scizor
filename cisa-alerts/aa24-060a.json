These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) are releasing this joint CSA, to disseminate known TTPs and IOCs associated with the Phobos ransomware variants observed as recently as February 2024, according to open source reporting. Phobos is structured as a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) model. Since May 2019, Phobos ransomware incidents impacting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments have been regularly reported to the MS\\-ISAC. These incidents targeted municipal and county governments, emergency services, education, public healthcare, and other critical infrastructure entities to successfully ransom several million U.S. dollars.\\[\n [1](https://www.privacyaffairs.com/moral-8-base-ransomware-targets-2-new-victims/ \"\u201cMoral\u201d 8Base Ransomware Targets 2 New Victims\") \n ],\\[\n [2](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2023/06/8base-ransomware-a-heavy-hitting-player.html \"8Base Ransomware: A Heavy Hitting Player\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n The FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Phobos ransomware and other ransomware incidents.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-060A \\#StopRansomware: Phobos Ransomware](/sites/default/files/2024-02/aa24-060a-stopransomware-phobos-ransomware_1.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 678\\.84 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-060A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2024-02/AA24-060A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 147\\.73 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-060A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2024-02/AA24-060A-StopRansomware-Phobos-Ransomware.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 119\\.53 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 14\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\") \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Overview**\n\n\n\n According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware is likely connected to numerous variants (including Elking, Eight, Devos, Backmydata, and Faust ransomware) due to similar TTPs observed in Phobos intrusions. Phobos ransomware operates in conjunction with various open source tools such as Smokeloader, Cobalt Strike, and Bloodhound. These tools are all widely accessible and easy to use in various operating environments, making it (and associated variants) a popular choice for many threat actors.\\[\n [3](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/phobos-ransomware-new-faust-variant/ \"Phobos Ransomware Family Expands With New FAUST Variant\") \n ],\\[\n [4](https://therecord.media/romanian-hospitals-offline-after-ransomware-attack \"Hospitals offline across Romania following ransomware attack on IT platform\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Reconnaissance and Initial Access**\n\n\n\n Phobos actors typically gain initial access to vulnerable networks by leveraging phishing campaigns \\[\n [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/ \"Phishing for Information\") \n ] to drop hidden payloads or using internet protocol (IP) scanning tools, such as Angry IP Scanner, to search for vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports \\[\n [T1595\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1595/001/ \"Active Scanning: Scanning IP Blocks\") \n ] or by leveraging RDP on Microsoft Windows environments.\\[\n [5](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/phobos-ransomware/ \"What is Phobos Ransomware & How to Protect Against It?\") \n ],\\[\n [6](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/understanding-the-phobos-affiliate-structure/ \"Understanding the Phobos affiliate structure and activity\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n Once they discover an exposed RDP service, the actors use open source brute force tools to gain access \\[\n [T1110](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1110/ \"Brute Force\") \n ]. If Phobos actors gain successful RDP authentication \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ]\\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ] in the targeted environment, they perform open source research to create a victim profile and connect the targeted IP addresses to their associated companies \\[\n [T1593](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1593/ \"Search Open Websites/Domains\") \n ]. Threat actors leveraging Phobos have notably deployed remote access tools to establish a remote connection within the compromised network \\[\n [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\") \n ].\\[\n [7](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/deep-dive-into-phobos-ransomware/ \"A deep dive into Phobos ransomware, recently deployed by 8Base group\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n Alternatively, threat actors send spoofed email attachments \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/001/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\") \n ] that are embedded with hidden payloads \\[\n [T1204\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1204/002/ \"User Execution: Malicious File\") \n ] such as SmokeLoader, a backdoor trojan that is often used in conjunction with Phobos. After SmokeLoader\u2019s hidden payload is downloaded onto the victim\u2019s system, threat actors use the malware\u2019s functionality to download the Phobos payload and exfiltrate data from the compromised system.\n \n\n\n#### **Execution and Privilege Escalation**\n\n\n\n Phobos actors run executables like\n `1saas.exe` \n or\n `cmd.exe` \n to deploy additional Phobos payloads that have elevated privileges enabled \\[\n [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0004/ \"Privilege Escalation\") \n ]. Additionally, Phobos actors can use the previous commands to perform various windows shell functions. The Windows command shell enables threat actors to control various aspects of a system, with multiple permission levels required for different subsets of commands \\[\n [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/003/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\") \n ]\\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\") \n ].\\[\n [8](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/07/a-deep-dive-into-phobos-ransomware \"A deep dive into Phobos ransomware\") \n ]\n \n\n\n##### ***Smokeloader Deployment***\n\n\n\n Phobos operations feature a standard three phase process to decrypt a payload that allows the threat actors to deploy additional destructive malware.\\[\n [9](https://any.run/malware-trends/smoke \"Smoke Loader\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n For the first phase, Smokeloader manipulates either\n `VirtualAlloc` \n or\n `VirtualProtect API` \n functions\u2014which opens an entry point, enabling code to be injected into running processes and allowing the malware to evade network defense tools \\[\n [T1055\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1055/002/ \"Process Injection: Portable Executable Injection\") \n ]. In the second phase, a stealth process is used to obfuscate command and control (C2\\) activity by producing requests to legitimate websites \\[\n [T1001\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1001/003/ \"Data Obfuscation: Protocol Impersonation\") \n ].\\[\n [10](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.smokeloader \"SmokeLoader\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n Within this phase, the shellcode also sends a call from the entry point to a memory container \\[\n [T1055\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1055/004/ \"Process Injection: Asynchronous Procedure Call\") \n ] and prepares a portable executable for deployment in the final stage \\[\n [T1027\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1027/002/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\") \n ]\\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\") \n ]\\[\n [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1140/ \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Finally, once Smokeloader reaches its third stage, it unpacks a program\\-erase cycle from stored memory, which is then sent to be extracted from a SHA 256 hash as a payload.\\[\n [7](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/deep-dive-into-phobos-ransomware/ \"A deep dive into Phobos ransomware, recently deployed by 8Base group\") \n ] Following successful payload decryption, the threat actors can begin downloading additional malware.\n \n\n\n##### ***Additional Phobos Defense Evasion Capabilities***\n\n\n\n Phobos ransomware actors have been observed bypassing organizational network defense protocols by modifying system firewall configurations using commands like\n `netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable` \n \\[\n [T1562\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1562/004/ \"Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall\") \n ]. Additionally, Phobos actors can evade detection by using the following tools: Universal Virus Sniffer, Process Hacker, and PowerTool \\[\n [T1562](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1562/ \"Impair Defenses\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**\n\n\n\n According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware uses commands such as\n `Exec.exe` \n or the\n `bcdedit[.]exe` \n control mechanism. Phobos has also been observed using Windows Startup folders and Run Registry Keys such as\n `C:/Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\directory` \n \\[\n [T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1490/ \"Inhibit System Recovery\") \n ]\\[\n [T1547\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1547/001/ \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\") \n ] to maintain persistence within compromised environments.\\[\n [5](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/phobos-ransomware/ \"What is Phobos Ransomware & How to Protect Against It?\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n Additionally, Phobos actors have been observed using built\\-in Windows API functions \\[\n [T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1106/ \"Native API\") \n ] to steal tokens \\[\n [T1134\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1134/001/ \"Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft\") \n ], bypass access controls, and create new processes to escalate privileges by leveraging the\n `SeDebugPrivilege` \n process \\[\n [T1134\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1134/002/ \"Access Token Manipulation: Create Process with Token\") \n ]. Phobos actors attempt to authenticate using cached password hashes on victim machines until they reach domain administrator access \\[\n [T1003\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/005/ \"OS Credential Dumping: Cached Domain Credentials\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Discovery and Credential Access**\n\n\n\n Phobos actors additionally use open source tools \\[\n [T1588\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1588/002/ \"Obtain Capabilities: Tool\") \n ] such as\n [Bloodhound](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0521/ \"BloodHound\") \n and Sharphound to enumerate the active directory \\[\n [T1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1087/002/ \"Account Discovery: Domain Account\") \n ].\n [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0002/ \"Mimikatz\") \n and NirSoft, as well as Remote Desktop Passview to export browser client credentials \\[\n [T1003\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/001/ \"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\") \n ]\\[\n [T1555\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1555/003/ \"Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers\") \n ], have also been used. Furthermore, Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate connected storage devices \\[\n [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1082/ \"System Information Discovery\") \n ], running processes \\[\n [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1057/ \"Process Discovery\") \n ], and encrypt user files \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Exfiltration**\n\n\n\n Phobos actors have been observed using\n `WinSCP` \n and\n `Mega.io` \n for file exfiltration.\\[\n [11](https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/a-case-of-the-faust-ransomware \"A case of the FAUST Ransomware\") \n ] They use\n `WinSCP` \n to connect directly from a victim network to an FTP server \\[\n [T1071\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1071/002/ \"Application Layer Protocol: File Transfer Protocols\") \n ] they control \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ]. Phobos actors install\n `Mega.io` \n \\[\n [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1048/ \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\") \n ] and use it to export victim files directly to a cloud storage provider \\[\n [T1567\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1567/002/ \"Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\") \n ]. Data is typically archived as either a\n `.rar` \n or\n `.zip` \n file \\[\n [T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/ \"Archive Collected Data\") \n ] to be later exfiltrated. They target legal documentation, financial records, technical documents (including network architecture), and databases for commonly used password management software \\[\n [T1555\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1555/005/ \"Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Impact**\n\n\n\n After the exfiltration phase, Phobos actors then hunt for backups. They use\n `vssadmin.exe` \n and Windows Management Instrumentation command\\-line utility (WMIC) to discover and delete volume shadow copies in Windows environments. This prevents victims from recovering files after encryption has taken place \\[\n [T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1047/ \"Windows Management Instrumentation\") \n ]\\[\n [T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1490/ \"Inhibit System Recovery\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n`Phobos.exe` \n contains functionality to encrypt all connected logical drives on the target host \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ]. Each Phobos ransomware executable has unique build identifiers (IDs), affiliate IDs, as well as a unique ransom note which is embedded in the executable. After the ransom note has populated on infected workstations, Phobos ransomware continues to search for and encrypt additional files.\n \n\n\n\n Most extortion \\[\n [T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/ \"Financial Theft\") \n ] occurs via email; however, some affiliate groups have used voice calls to contact victims.

The FBI, CISA, and MS\\-ISAC recommend that software manufacturers incorporate secure by design and default principles and tactics into their software development practices limiting the impact of ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the secure posture for their customers.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage and\n [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n The FBI, CISA, and MS\\-ISAC recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture against actors\u2019 activity. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n* **Secure remote access software by** \n applying recommendations from the joint\n [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\") \n .\n* **Implement application controls** \n to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs.\n\t+ Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlist solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n* **Implement log collection best practices** \n and use intrusion detection systems to defend against threat actors manipulating firewall configurations through early detection \\[\n [CPG 2\\.T](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T \"Log Collection (2.T)\") \n ].\n\t+ Implement\n\t [EDR solutions](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/spotlight/edr-spotlight-module \"EDR Spotlight Module\") \n\t to disrupt threat actor memory allocation techniques.\n* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services** \n . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NoExploitableServicesontheInternet2W \"No Exploitable Services on the Internet (2.W)\") \n ]:\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ [Apply phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n\t .\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n* **Disable command\\-line and scripting** \n activities and permissions \\[\n [CPG 2\\.N](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N \"Disable Macros by Default (2.N)\") \n ].\n* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories** \n for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[\n [CPG 4\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DeploySecurityTXTFiles4C \"Deploy Security.TXT Files (4.C)\") \n ].\n* **Audit user accounts with administrative privileges** \n and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E \"Separating User and Privileged Accounts (2.E)\") \n ].\n* **Reduce the threat of credential compromise** \n via the following:\n\t+ Place domain admin accounts in the protected users\u2019 group to prevent caching of password hashes locally.\n\t+ Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts.\n* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts** \n at the admin level and higher \\[\n [CPG 2\\.A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#ChangingDefaultPasswords2A \"Changing Default Passwords (2.A)\") \n ,\n [2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E \"Separating User and Privileged Accounts (2.E)\") \n ].\n\n\n\n In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data** \n and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption to its business practices \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\") \n ].\n* **Require all accounts** \n with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\n **to comply** \n with NIST's\n [standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\") \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters and no more than 64 characters in length \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.B](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MinimumPasswordStrength2B \"Minimum Password Strength (2.B)\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\n\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\n\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#UniqueCredentials2C \"Unique Credentials (2.C)\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.G](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectionofUnsuccessfulAutomatedLoginAttempts2G \"Detection of Unsuccessful (Automated) Login Attempts (2.G)\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\n\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\t   \n\t\n\t**Note:** \n\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)** \n for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H \"Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA) (2.H)\") \n ].\n* **Segment networks** \n to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F \"Network Segmentation (2.F)\") \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A \"Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)\") \n ].\n* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software** \n on all hosts.\n* **Disable unused** \n**ports and protocols** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.V](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#ProhibitConnectionofUnauthorizedDevices2V \"Prohibit Connection of Unauthorized Devices (2.V)\") \n ].\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#EmailSecurity2M \"Email Security (2.M)\") \n ].\n* **Disable hyperlinks** \n in received emails.\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#StrongandAgileEncryption2K \"Strong and Agile Encryption (2.K)\") \n ,\n [2\\.L](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureSensitiveData2L \"Secure Sensitive Data (2.L)\") \n ,\n [2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\") \n ].\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and MS\\-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI, CISA, and MS\\-ISAC recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 4\\-16\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n The FBI, CISA, and MS\\-ISAC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n*
