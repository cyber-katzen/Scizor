EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : SIMATIC CN 4100* **Vulnerabilities**  : Authorization Bypass Through User\\-Controlled Key, Improper Input Validation, Use of Default Credentials2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to remotely login as root or cause denial of service condition of the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* SIMATIC CN 4100: Versions prior to V2\\.7### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER\\-CONTROLLED KEY CWE\\-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)** The \"intermediate installation\" system state of the affected application allows an attacker to add their own login credentials to the device. This allows an attacker to remotely login as root and take control of the device even after the affected device is fully set up.[CVE\\-2023\\-49251](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-49251)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** The affected application allows IP configuration change without authentication to the device. This could allow an attacker to cause denial of service condition.[CVE\\-2023\\-49252](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-49252)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [USE OF DEFAULT CREDENTIALS CWE\\-1392](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1392.html)** The \"intermediate installation\" system state of the affected application uses default credential with admin privileges. An attacker could use the credentials to gain complete control of the affected device.[CVE\\-2023\\-49621](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-49621)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* SIMATIC CN 4100: Update to [V2\\.7](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109814144/)  or later version. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-777015 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-777015.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-777015.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
