EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0SDG Technologies\nEquipment:\u00a0PnPSCADA\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0SQL Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to interact with the database and retrieve critical data.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SDG PnPSCADA products are affected:\n\nPnPSCADA (cross platforms): v2.*\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nThe PnPSCADA system, a product of SDG Technologies CC, is afflicted by a critical unauthenticated error-based PostgreSQL Injection vulnerability. Present within the hitlogcsv.jsp endpoint, this security flaw permits unauthenticated attackers to engage with the underlying database seamlessly and passively. Consequently, malicious actors could gain access to vital information, such as Industrial Control System (ICS) and OT data, alongside other sensitive records like SMS and SMS Logs. The unauthorized database access exposes compromised systems to potential manipulation or breach of essential infrastructure data, highlighting the severity of this vulnerability.\nCVE-2023-1934 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0South Africa\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMomen Eldawakhly of Samurai Digital Security Ltd reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSDG PnpSCADA is aware of the issue and is currently developing a fix. For more information, contact PnpSCADA by email.\nThe following workarounds are recommended to help reduce the risk:\n\nUse prepared statements to help prevent SQL injections.\nAvoid making assets publicly accessible.\nRestrict public access: As a primary mitigation, it is crucial for all PnPSCADA users to avoid exposing their SCADA systems to the internet. By implementing proper network segmentation and isolating the SCADA system from public networks, users can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exploitation.\nImplement strong access controls: Ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to limit access to sensitive components of the SCADA system. This includes implementing role-based access control and regular audits of user privileges.\nMonitor and log activity: Continuously monitor and log all activities within the SCADA environment. This helps with detecting any potential unauthorized access or attempts to exploit the vulnerability, enabling timely response and mitigation.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
