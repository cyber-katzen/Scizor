EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ABB\nEquipment: PB610 Panel Builder 600\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Improper Authentication, Relative Path Traversal, Improper Input Validation, Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nAn attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities could prevent legitimate access to an affected system node, remotely cause an affected system node to stop, take control of an affected system node, or insert and run arbitrary code in an affected system node.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PB610 Panel Builder 600, an engineering tool for designing HMI applications and the runtime for control panels, which are used for the operation of automation systems, are affected:\n\nPB610 Panel Builder 600, order code: 1SAP500900R0101, Versions 1.91 \u2026 2.8.0.367 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe ABB CP635 HMI component implements hidden administrative accounts used during the provisioning phase of the HMI interface. These credentials allow the provisioning tool \u201cPanel Builder 600\u201d to flash a new interface and Tags (MODBUS coils) mapping to the HMI. These credentials are used over both HTTP(S) and FTP. There is no option to disable or change these undocumented credentials.\nCVE-2019-7225 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe IDAL HTTP server CGI interface contains a URL, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to privileged functions.\nCVE-2019-7226 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nThe IDAL FTP server fails to ensure directory change requests do not change to locations outside of the root FTP directory. An authenticated attacker can simply traverse outside the server root directory by changing the directory.\nCVE-2019-7227 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe IDAL HTTP server is vulnerable to memory corruption through insecure use of user supplied format strings. An attacker can abuse this functionality to bypass authentication or execute code on the server.\nCVE-2019-7228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to memory corruption through insecure use of user supplied format strings. An attacker can abuse this functionality to bypass authentication or execute code on the server.\nCVE-2019-7230 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe IDAL HTTP server is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when a large host header is sent in a HTTP request. The host header value overflows a buffer and can overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) address with a large chunk of data.\nCVE-2019-7232 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a large string is sent by an authenticated attacker. This overflow is handled, but terminates the process.\nCVE-2019-7231 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nXen1thLabs, a Darkmatter Company, United Arab Emirates, and Abu Dhabi reported these vulnerabilities to ABB.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe problems are corrected in the following product versions:\nPB610 Panel Builder 600 v2.8.0.424.\nNew version of BSP (board support package) UN31 v2.31.\nNew version of BSP (board support package) UN30 v2.31.\nABB recommends users apply the update of the PB610 applications on CP600 control panels at the earliest convenience.\nIf an update of the devices is not possible. ABB recommends users restrict network access to the devices to only trusted parties/devices.\nTo prevent an unauthorized login via a remote client, leave the \u201cForce Remote Login\u201d option of the security settings checked (default setting). In addition, set new users and passwords in the user\u2019s settings for remote clients to \u201cuse different user and password.\u201d\nABB\u2019s recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include :\n\nRestrict physical access to process control systems to authorized personnel,\nDo not have direct connections to the Internet,\nSeparate from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of exposed ports,\nProcess control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails.\nPortable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.\n\nMore information on ABB\u2019s recommended practices can be found in the following document:\n3BSE032547, Whitepaper \u2013 Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems\nFor additional information and support please contact the local ABB service organization. For contact information, see: https://new.abb.com/contact-centers.\nInformation about ABB\u2019s cybersecurity program and capabilities can be found at: http://www.abb.com/cybersecurity.\nFor more information see ABB\u2019s security advisory 3ADR010377.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. If a control panel with a PB610 HMI application is connected to a network, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit these vulnerabilities. If the control panel is not connected to a network, an attacker would need to have physical access to an affected system node to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n",
