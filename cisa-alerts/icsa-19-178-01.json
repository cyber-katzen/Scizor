TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of PB610 Panel Builder 600, an engineering tool for designing HMI applications and the runtime for control panels, which are used for the operation of automation systems, are affected:* PB610 Panel Builder 600, order code: 1SAP500900R0101, Versions 1\\.91 \u2026 2\\.8\\.0\\.367 and prior.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) The ABB CP635 HMI component implements hidden administrative accounts used during the provisioning phase of the HMI interface. These credentials allow the provisioning tool \u201cPanel Builder 600\u201d to flash a new interface and Tags (MODBUS coils) mapping to the HMI. These credentials are used over both HTTP(S) and FTP. There is no option to disable or change these undocumented credentials.[CVE\\-2019\\-7225](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-7225)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- The problems are corrected in the following product versions:[PB610 Panel Builder 600 v2\\.8\\.0\\.424](http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107492A4167&LanguageCode=de&LanguageCode=en&LanguageCode=es&LanguageCode=fr&LanguageCode=zh&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  .[New version of BSP (board support package) UN31 v2\\.31](http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=BSPCP600UN31V231&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  .[New version of BSP (board support package) UN30 v2\\.31](http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=BSPCP600UN30V231&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . ABB recommends users apply the update of the PB610 applications on CP600 control panels at the earliest convenience. If an update of the devices is not possible. ABB recommends users restrict network access to the devices to only trusted parties/devices. To prevent an unauthorized login via a remote client, leave the \u201cForce Remote Login\u201d option of the security settings checked (default setting). In addition, set new users and passwords in the user\u2019s settings for remote clients to \u201cuse different user and password.\u201d ABB\u2019s recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include :* Restrict physical access to process control systems to authorized personnel,* Do not have direct connections to the Internet,* Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of exposed ports,* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. More information on ABB\u2019s recommended practices can be found in the following document:[3BSE032547, Whitepaper \u2013 Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems](https://library.e.abb.com/public/b1f29a78bc9979d7c12577ec00177633/3BSE032547_B_en_Security_for_Industrial_Automation_and_Control_Systems.pdf)  For additional information and support please contact the local ABB service organization. For contact information, see: [https://new.abb.com/contact\\-centers](https://new.abb.com/contact-centers)  . Information about ABB\u2019s cybersecurity program and capabilities can be found at: <http://www.abb.com/cybersecurity> . For more information see ABB\u2019s security advisory [3ADR010377](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR010377&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. If a control panel with a PB610 HMI application is connected to a network, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit these vulnerabilities. If the control panel is not connected to a network, an attacker would need to have physical access to an affected system node to exploit these vulnerabilities.
