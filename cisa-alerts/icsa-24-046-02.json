EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 9\\.1*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : SIDIS Prime* **Vulnerabilities**  : Use of Insufficiently Random Values, NULL Pointer Dereference, Infinite Loop2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker with access to the network where SIDIS Prime is installed to reuse OPC UA client credentials, create a denial\\-of\\-service condition of the SIDIS Prime OPC UA client, or create a denial\\-of\\-service condition of the SIDIS Prime TLS service.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens products are affected:* SIDIS Prime: All versions prior to V4\\.0\\.400### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE\\-330](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)** In OPC Foundation OPC UA .NET Standard codebase 1\\.4\\.357\\.28, servers do not create sufficiently random numbers in OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua before 1\\.4\\.359\\.31, which allows man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attackers to reuse encrypted user credentials sent over the network.[CVE\\-2019\\-19135](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19135)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2019\\-19135](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19135)  . A base score of 9\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  .**3\\.2\\.2 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)** Server or client applications that call the SSL\\_check\\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1\\.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the \"signature\\_algorithms\\_cert\" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognized signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a denial\\-of\\-service attack.[CVE\\-2020\\-1967](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-1967)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2020\\-1967](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-1967)  . A base score of 8\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  .**3\\.2\\.3 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)** The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial\\-of\\-service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp function for two purposes: 1\\) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate. 2\\) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\\_RESP\\_verify\\_response and TS\\_RESP\\_verify\\_token). If an attacker can control both items being compared, then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example, if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL, then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s\\_server, s\\_client and verify tools have support for the \"\\-crl\\_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However, it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack.[CVE\\-2020\\-1971](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-1971)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2020\\-1971](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-1971)  . A base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  .**3\\.2\\.4 [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE\\-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)** The BN\\_mod\\_sqrt() function in openSSL, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non\\-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger an infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial\\-of\\-service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters.[CVE\\-2022\\-0778](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-0778)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2022\\-0778](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-0778)  . A base score of 8\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  .**3\\.2\\.5 [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE\\-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)** An infinite loop in OPC UA .NET Standard Stack 1\\.04\\.368 allows a remote attackers to cause the application to hang via a crafted message.[CVE\\-2022\\-29862](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29862)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).
