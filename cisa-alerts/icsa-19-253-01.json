EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: TPEditor\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow information disclosure, remote code execution, or may crash the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of TPEditor, a programming software for Delta text panels, are affected:\n\nTPEditor Versions 1.94 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-13540 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-13536 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nMultiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, which may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-13544 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya of 9sg Security Team working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends affected users update to the latest version of Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor, Version 1.95, which is available for download at:\nhttp://www.deltaww.com/services/DownloadCenter2.aspx?secID=8&pid=2&tid=0&CID=06&itemID=060302&typeID=1&downloadID=&title=&dataType=8;&check=1&hl=en-US\nDelta Electronics also recommends affected users restrict the interaction with the application to trusted files.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
