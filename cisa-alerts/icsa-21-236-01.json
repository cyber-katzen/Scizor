TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Hitachi ABB Power Grids reports these vulnerabilities affect the following products:* TropOS: Firmware Version 8\\.9\\.4\\.8 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS IN OUTPUT USED BY A DOWNSTREAM COMPONENT ('INJECTION') CWE\\-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html) The 802\\.11 standard that underpins Wi\\-Fi protected access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3\\) and wired equivalent privacy (WEP) does not require received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this vulnerability can be exploited to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.[CVE\\-2020\\-24586](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-24586)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html) The 802\\.11 standard that underpins Wi\\-Fi protected access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3\\) and wired equivalent privacy (WEP) does not require all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary could exploit this vulnerability to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.[CVE\\-2020\\-24587](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-24587)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html) The 802\\.11 standard that underpins Wi\\-Fi protected access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3\\) and wired equivalent privacy (WEP) does not require the A\\-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field be authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non\\-SSP A\\-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802\\.11n), an adversary could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary network packets.[CVE\\-2020\\-24588](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-24588)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This might be abused in projected Wi\\-Fi networks to launch denial\\-of\\-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.[CVE\\-2020\\-26139](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26139)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi ABB Power Grids recommends updating to firmware v8\\.9\\.4\\.9 or later, which resolves these vulnerabilities. For additional information on these vulnerabilities, including update instructions, please see the [Hitachi ABB Power Grids security advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107992A4463&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . Hitachi ABB Power Grids has tested and recommends the following mitigation actions, which help block known attack vectors:* Disable the Wi\\-Fi access on any TropOS unit where local Wi\\-Fi access is not required. This is achieved by NOT enabling (or disabling) the local access SSID.* Where Wi\\-Fi access is required, wherever possible ensure physical access to the local area is restricted to approved staff only.* Use the Wi\\-Fi whitelist capability to restrict Wi\\-Fi access to only approved personnel.* As the FragAttacks vulnerability is targeted at an end\\-user device and generally involves redirection to fraudulent websites, the installation of comprehensive firewall capabilities on company end\\-user devices and servers will significantly reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
