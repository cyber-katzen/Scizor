MITIGATIONS\nMotorola Solutions recommends the following for each identified vulnerability:\nCVE-2024-38279:\n\nUse secure boot implementation with an edit-resistant GRUB partition.\nAdditional mitigation consists in limiting the physical access to the device by following the best practices for device mounting.\n\nEdit-resistant grub partition has been remediated for all vulnerable systems. Motorola Solutionswill release a secure boot implementation in Fall 2024. All customers will receive the updatethrough OTA (over the air) mechanisms. No further actions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38280:\n\nApply encryption to all Criminal Justice Information (CJI) data.\nApply full disk encryption with LUKS encryption standards and add password protectionto the GRUB Bootloader.\nPerform column-level encryption for sensitive data in the database.\n\nAll devices shipped after May 10, 2024 are already using full disk encryption. All devices thatare not able to have full disk encryption applied have had all CJI data encrypted. No furtheractions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38281:\n\nRemove the hard-coded credential to access the wireless access point and disable theaccess point if not needed.\nSet a unique SSID and password if the access point is needed.\n\nMotorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38282:\n\nRemove the hard coded credentials.\nUse a unique CJIS compliant password per device.\n\nMotorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38283:\n\nRemove the hotlist data from the device.\n\nMotorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. Nofurther actions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38284:\n\nDelete the log files.\nInstall updated software not logging the credentialed web request.\n\nMotorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers.\nCVE-2024-38285:\n\nDelete the log files.\n\nMotorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
