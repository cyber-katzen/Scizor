MITIGATIONS--------------- Motorola Solutions recommends the following for each identified vulnerability: CVE\\-2024\\-38279:* Use secure boot implementation with an edit\\-resistant GRUB partition.* Additional mitigation consists in limiting the physical access to the device by following the best practices for device mounting. Edit\\-resistant grub partition has been remediated for all vulnerable systems. Motorola Solutions will release a secure boot implementation in Fall 2024\\. All customers will receive the update through OTA (over the air) mechanisms. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38280:* Apply encryption to all Criminal Justice Information (CJI) data.* Apply full disk encryption with LUKS encryption standards and add password protection to the GRUB Bootloader.* Perform column\\-level encryption for sensitive data in the database. All devices shipped after May 10, 2024 are already using full disk encryption. All devices that are not able to have full disk encryption applied have had all CJI data encrypted. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38281:* Remove the hard\\-coded credential to access the wireless access point and disable the access point if not needed.* Set a unique SSID and password if the access point is needed. Motorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38282:* Remove the hard coded credentials.* Use a unique CJIS compliant password per device. Motorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38283:* Remove the hotlist data from the device. Motorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38284:* Delete the log files.* Install updated software not logging the credentialed web request. Motorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers. CVE\\-2024\\-38285:* Delete the log files. Motorola Solutions has already remediated this vulnerability for all vulnerable systems. No further actions are required by customers. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
