EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: U.motion Builder\nVulnerabilities: Command Injection, Cross-site Scripting, and Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following U.motion Builder Software versions are affected:\n\nU.motion Builder versions prior to 1.3.4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nAn input string may be evaluated as a command by the application. An attacker could exploit this to execute code, read the stack, or cause a segmentation fault in the running application.\nCVE-2018-7784 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND (OS COMMAND INJECTION) CWE-78\nA remote command injection allows authentication bypass.\nCVE-2018-7785 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION (CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING) CWE-79\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists, which could allow injection of malicious scripts.\nCVE-2018-7786 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of input of context parameter in HTTP GET request, which could allow the disclosure of sensitive information.\nCVE-2018-7787 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, and Energy\nCountries/Areas Deployed: United States, Europe, and Asia\nCompany Headquarters Location: Paris, France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nWei Gao of Keysight and bigric3@360A-TEAM reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric has released firmware update Version 1.3.4, which includes fixes for these vulnerabilities. It is highly recommended that U.motion Builder users apply the patch in a timely manner.\nThe firmware is available for download at:\u00a0\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/Umotion_Server_update/\nSchneider Electric\u2019s security notice SEVD-2018-151-01 is available at the following location:\nhttps://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-151-01/\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
