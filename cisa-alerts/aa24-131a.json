[News \\& Events](/news-events)4. [Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity Advisory\\#StopRansomware: Black Basta============================= Release Date May 10, 2024 Alert Code AA24\\-131A Related topics: , [Incident Detection, Response, and Prevention](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/incident-detection-response-and-prevention)  , [Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/malware-phishing-and-ransomware) #### Actions for critical infrastructure organizations to take today to mitigate cyber threats from ransomware:1. Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are released.2. Require phishing\\-resistant MFA for as many services as possible.3. Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.### **SUMMARY*****Note**  : This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* [*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.*  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations)\u00a0are releasing this joint CSA to provide information on Black Basta, a ransomware variant whose actors have encrypted and stolen data from at least 12 out of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector. This joint CSA provides TTPs and IOCs obtained from FBI investigations and third\\-party reporting. Black Basta is considered a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April 2022\\.\u00a0Black Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, Europe, and Australia. As of May 2024, Black Basta affiliates have impacted over 500 organizations globally. Black Basta affiliates use common initial access techniques\u2014such as phishing and exploiting known vulnerabilities\u2014and then employ a double\\-extortion model, both encrypting systems and exfiltrating data. Ransom notes do not generally include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions. Instead, the notes provide victims with a unique code and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a `.onion`  URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Typically, the ransom notes give victims between 10 and 12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site, Basta News. Healthcare organizations are attractive targets for cybercrime actors due to their size, technological dependence, access to personal health information, and unique impacts from patient care disruptions. The authoring organizations urge HPH Sector and all critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations in the\u00a0Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from Black Basta and other ransomware attacks. Victims of ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA (see the Reporting section for contact information).

organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture based on Black Basta\u2019s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.* **Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are released**  \\[ [CPG 1\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E \"Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (1.E)\")  ]. Prioritize updating [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")  .* **Require phishing\\-resistant multi\\-factor authentication (MFA)**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H \"Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA) (2.H)\")  ] for as many services as possible.* **Implement recommendations, including training users to recognize and report phishing attempts**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.I](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#BasicCybersecurityTraining2I \"Basic Cybersecurity Training (2.I)\")  ], from joint [Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/phishing-guidance-stopping-attack-cycle-phase-one \"Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One\")  .* **Secure remote access software**  by applying mitigations from joint [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\")  .* **Make backups of critical systems and device configurations**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\")  ] to enable devices to be repaired and restored.* **Apply mitigations from the joint** [**\\#StopRansomware Guide**](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\") . The authoring organizations also recommend network defenders of HPH Sector and other critical infrastructure organizations to reference CISA\u2019s [Mitigation Guide: Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/mitigation-guide-healthcare-and-public-health-hph-sector \"Mitigation Guide: Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector\")  and HHS\u2019s [HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/performance-goals.html \"HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  , which provide best practices to combat pervasive cyber threats against organizations. Recommendations include the following:* **Asset Management and Security**  : Cybersecurity professionals should identify and understand all relationships or interdependencies, functionality of each asset, what it exposes, and what software is running to ensure critical data and systems are protected appropriately. HPH Sector organizations should ensure\u00a0electronic PHI (ePHI) is protected and compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Organizations can complete asset inventories using active scans, passive processes, or a combination of both techniques.* **Email Security and Phishing Prevention**  : Organizations should install modern anti\\-malware software and automatically update signatures where possible. For additional guidance, see CISA\u2019s [Enhance Email and Web Security Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhance-email-web-security \"Enhance Email & Web Security\")  .\t+ **Check for embedded or spoofed hyperlinks** \t : Validate the URL of the link matches the text of the link itself. This can be achieved by hovering your cursor over the link to view the URL of the website to be accessed.* **Access Management**  : Phishing\\-resistant MFA completes the same process but removes \u2018people\u2019 from the equation to help thwart social engineering scams and targeted phishing attacks that may have been successful using traditional MFA. The two main forms of phishing\\-resistant MFA are FIDO/Web Authentication (WebAuthn) authentication and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\\-based authentication. Prioritize phishing\\-resistant MFA on accounts with the highest risk, such as privileged administrative accounts on key assets. For additional information on phishing\\-resistant MFA, see CISA\u2019s [Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA Guide\")  .* **Vulnerability Management and Assessment**  : Once vulnerabilities are identified across your environment, evaluate and prioritize to appropriately deal with the posed risks according to your organization\u2019s risk strategy. To assist with prioritization, it is essential to:\t+ **Map your assets to business\\-critical functions.** \t For vulnerability remediation, prioritize assets that are most critical for ongoing operations or which, if affected, could impact your organization\u2019s business continuity, sensitive PII (or PHI) security, reputation, or financial position.\t+ **Use threat intelligence information.** \t For remediation, prioritize vulnerabilities actively exploited by threat actors. To assist, leverage CISA\u2019s\t [KEV Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \t and other threat intelligence feeds.\t+ **Leverage prioritization methodologies, ratings, and scores** \t . The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) assesses the technical severity of vulnerabilities. The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) measures the likelihood of exploitation and can help with deciding which vulnerabilities to prioritize. CISA\u2019s\t [Stakeholder\\-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)](https://www.cisa.gov/stakeholder-specific-vulnerability-categorization-ssvc \"Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)\") \t methodology leverages decision trees to prioritize relevant vulnerabilities into four decisions, Track, Track\\*, Attend, and Act based on exploitation status, technical impact, mission prevalence, and impacts to safety and public\\-wellbeing.### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 2\\-6\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. The authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.### **REFERENCES**1.

If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws. FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. Additional details of interest include: a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host\\- and network\\-based indicators. FBI, CISA, and HHS do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be\u00a0recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI\u2019s [Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3\\)](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complain Center\")  , a local FBI [Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\")  , or CISA via the agency\u2019s [Incident Reporting System](https://www.cisa.gov/forms/report \"Incident Reporting System\")  or its 24/7 Operations Center ( [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\")  or by calling 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA \\[1\\-844\\-729\\-2472]).### **DISCLAIMER** The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
