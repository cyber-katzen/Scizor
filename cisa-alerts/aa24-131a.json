Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n***Note** \n : This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations)\u00a0are releasing this joint CSA to provide information on Black Basta, a ransomware variant whose actors have encrypted and stolen data from at least 12 out of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector.\n \n\n\n\n This joint CSA provides TTPs and IOCs obtained from FBI investigations and third\\-party reporting. Black Basta is considered a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April 2022\\.\u00a0Black Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, Europe, and Australia. As of May 2024, Black Basta affiliates have impacted over 500 organizations globally.\n \n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates use common initial access techniques\u2014such as phishing and exploiting known vulnerabilities\u2014and then employ a double\\-extortion model, both encrypting systems and exfiltrating data. Ransom notes do not generally include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions. Instead, the notes provide victims with a unique code and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a\n `.onion` \n URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Typically, the ransom notes give victims between 10 and 12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site, Basta News.\n \n\n\n\n Healthcare organizations are attractive targets for cybercrime actors due to their size, technological dependence, access to personal health information, and unique impacts from patient care disruptions. The authoring organizations urge HPH Sector and all critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations in the\u00a0Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from Black Basta and other ransomware attacks. Victims of ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA (see the Reporting section for contact information).\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-131A \\#StopRansomware: Black Basta](/sites/default/files/2024-07/aa24-131a-joint-csa-stopransomware-black-basta_2.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 613\\.62 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-131A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2024-05/AA24-131A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 237\\.45 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-131A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2024-05/AA24-131A-StopRansomware-Black-Basta.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 180\\.78 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 15\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping) \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Initial Access**\n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates primarily use spearphishing \\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1566/001/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\") \n ] to obtain initial access. According to cybersecurity researchers, affiliates have also used\n [Qakbot](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-242a \"Identification and Disruption of QakBot Infrastructure\") \n during initial access.\\[\n [1](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/black-basta-ransomware-attacks-deploy-custom-edr-evasion-tools-tied-to-fin7-threat-actor/ \"Black Basta Ransomware | Attacks Deploy Custom EDR Evasion Tools Tied to FIN7 Threat Actor\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n Starting in February 2024, Black Basta affiliates began exploiting ConnectWise vulnerability\n [CVE\\-2024\\-1709](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1709 \"CVE-2024-1709\") \n \\[\n [CWE\\-288](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html \"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\") \n ] \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ]. In some instances, affiliates have been observed abusing valid credentials \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Discovery and Execution**\n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates use tools such as SoftPerfect network scanner (\n `netscan.exe` \n ) to conduct network scanning. Cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates conducting reconnaissance using utilities with innocuous file names such as\n `Intel` \n or\n `Dell` \n , left in the root drive\n `C:\\` \n \\[\n [T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1036/ \"Masquerading\") \n ].\\[\n [1](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/black-basta-ransomware-attacks-deploy-custom-edr-evasion-tools-tied-to-fin7-threat-actor/ \"Black Basta Ransomware | Attacks Deploy Custom EDR Evasion Tools Tied to FIN7 Threat Actor\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Lateral Movement**\n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates use tools such as BITSAdmin and PsExec, along with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), for lateral movement. Some affiliates also use tools like Splashtop, Screen Connect, and Cobalt Strike beacons to assist with remote access and lateral movement.\n \n\n\n#### **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**\n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates use credential scraping tools like Mimikatz for privilege escalation. According to cybersecurity researchers, Black Basta affiliates have also exploited ZeroLogon (\n [CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472 \"CVE-2020-1472\") \n , \\[\n [CWE\\-330](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html \"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\") \n ]), NoPac (\n [CVE\\-2021\\-42278](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42278 \"CVE-2021-42278\") \n \\[\n [CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html \"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\") \n ] and\n [CVE\\-2021\\-42287](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42287 \"CVE-2021-42287\") \n \\[\n [CWE\\-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html \"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\") \n ]), and PrintNightmare (\n [CVE\\-2021\\-34527](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34527 \"CVE-2021-34527\") \n , \\[\n [CWE\\-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html \"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\") \n ]) vulnerabilities for local and Windows Active Domain privilege escalation \\[\n [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1068/ \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\") \n ].\\[\n [1](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/black-basta-ransomware-attacks-deploy-custom-edr-evasion-tools-tied-to-fin7-threat-actor/ \"Black Basta Ransomware | Attacks Deploy Custom EDR Evasion Tools Tied to FIN7 Threat Actor\") \n ],\\[\n [2](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-blackbasta \"Ransomware Spotlight: Black Basta\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Exfiltration and Encryption**\n\n\n\n Black Basta affiliates use RClone to facilitate data exfiltration prior to encryption. Prior to exfiltration,\u00a0cybersecurity researchers have observed Black Basta affiliates using PowerShell \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\") \n ] to disable antivirus products, and in some instances, deploying a tool called Backstab, designed to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling \\[\n [T1562\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/001/ \"Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\") \n ].\\[\n [3](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/black-basta-technical-analysis \"Black Basta - Technical Analysis\") \n ] Once antivirus programs are terminated, a ChaCha20 algorithm with an RSA\\-4096 public key fully encrypts files \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ]. A\n `.basta` \n or otherwise random file extension is added to file names and a ransom note titled\n `readme.txt` \n is left on the compromised system.\\[\n [4](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/black-basta \"Who Is Black Basta?\") \n ] To further inhibit system recovery, affiliates use the\n `vssadmin.exe` \n program to delete volume shadow copies \\[\n [T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1490/ \"Inhibit System Recovery\") \n ].\\[\n [5](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-assessment-black-basta-ransomware/ \"Threat Assessment: Black Basta Ransomware\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Leveraged Tools**\n\n\n\n See\u00a0Table 1 for publicly available tools and applications\u00a0used by Black Basta affiliates. This includes legitimate tools repurposed for their operations.\n \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** \n Use of these tools and applications should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Tools Used by Black Basta Affiliates* \n\n| **Tool Name** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| BITSAdmin | A command\\-line utility that manages downloads/uploads between a client and server by using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to perform asynchronous file transfers. |\n| Cobalt Strike | A penetration testing tool used by security professions to test the security of networks and systems.

Recommendations include the following:\n \n\n\n* **Asset Management and Security** \n : Cybersecurity professionals should identify and understand all relationships or interdependencies, functionality of each asset, what it exposes, and what software is running to ensure critical data and systems are protected appropriately. HPH Sector organizations should ensure\u00a0electronic PHI (ePHI) is protected and compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Organizations can complete asset inventories using active scans, passive processes, or a combination of both techniques.\n* **Email Security and Phishing Prevention** \n : Organizations should install modern anti\\-malware software and automatically update signatures where possible. For additional guidance, see CISA\u2019s\n [Enhance Email and Web Security Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhance-email-web-security \"Enhance Email & Web Security\") \n .\n\t+ **Check for embedded or spoofed hyperlinks** \n\t : Validate the URL of the link matches the text of the link itself. This can be achieved by hovering your cursor over the link to view the URL of the website to be accessed.\n* **Access Management** \n : Phishing\\-resistant MFA completes the same process but removes \u2018people\u2019 from the equation to help thwart social engineering scams and targeted phishing attacks that may have been successful using traditional MFA. The two main forms of phishing\\-resistant MFA are FIDO/Web Authentication (WebAuthn) authentication and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\\-based authentication. Prioritize phishing\\-resistant MFA on accounts with the highest risk, such as privileged administrative accounts on key assets. For additional information on phishing\\-resistant MFA, see CISA\u2019s\n [Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA Guide\") \n .\n* **Vulnerability Management and Assessment** \n : Once vulnerabilities are identified across your environment, evaluate and prioritize to appropriately deal with the posed risks according to your organization\u2019s risk strategy. To assist with prioritization, it is essential to:\n\t+ **Map your assets to business\\-critical functions.** \n\t For vulnerability remediation, prioritize assets that are most critical for ongoing operations or which, if affected, could impact your organization\u2019s business continuity, sensitive PII (or PHI) security, reputation, or financial position.\n\t+ **Use threat intelligence information.** \n\t For remediation, prioritize vulnerabilities actively exploited by threat actors. To assist, leverage CISA\u2019s\n\t [KEV Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \n\t and other threat intelligence feeds.\n\t+ **Leverage prioritization methodologies, ratings, and scores** \n\t . The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) assesses the technical severity of vulnerabilities. The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) measures the likelihood of exploitation and can help with deciding which vulnerabilities to prioritize. CISA\u2019s\n\t [Stakeholder\\-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)](https://www.cisa.gov/stakeholder-specific-vulnerability-categorization-ssvc \"Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)\") \n\t methodology leverages decision trees to prioritize relevant vulnerabilities into four decisions, Track, Track\\*, Attend, and Act based on exploitation status, technical impact, mission prevalence, and impacts to safety and public\\-wellbeing.\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 2\\-6\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n The authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **REFERENCES**\n\n\n1.
