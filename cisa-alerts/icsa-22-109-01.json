EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.2\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Interlogix is a part of Carrier Global Corporation\nEquipment: Hills ComNav\nVulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, Inadequate Encryption Strength\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to log in to modify the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nCarrier reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Hills ComNav remote access integration modules:\u00a0\n\nHills ComNav: versions prior to 3002-19\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nThere is no limit to the number of attempts to authenticate for the local configuration pages for the Hills ComNav Version 3002-19 interface, which allows local attackers to brute-force credentials.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-26519 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nHills ComNav Version 3002-19 suffers from a weak communication channel. Traffic across the local network for the configuration pages can be viewed by a malicious actor. The size of certain communications packets is predictable. These issues could allow an attacker to learn the state of the system if they can observe the traffic. This would be possible even if the traffic was encrypted (e.g., using WPA2, as the packet sizes would remain observable).\nCVE-2022-1318 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Australia\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: \u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJacob Thompson of Flinders University, Dr. Paul Gardner-Stephen of Flinders University and DEWC Systems, and Dr. Samuel Chenoweth of Defence Science and Technology Group reported these vulnerabilities to Carrier.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCarrier recommends users upgrade to Version 4000-12 or later, which is the latest supported version at the time of this publication. \u00a0Please contact the Hills distributor to acquire the firmware update.\nMore information on this issue can be found in Carrier product security advisory CARR-PSA-002-1121.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
