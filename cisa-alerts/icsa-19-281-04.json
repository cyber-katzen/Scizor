EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC IT Unified Architecture Discrete Manufacturing (UADM)\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain read and write access to the related TeamCenter station.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens SIMATIC IT UADM, a part of the SIMATIC IT manufacturing execution system, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC IT UADM: All versions prior to 1.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nAn authenticated remote attacker could recover a password over Port 1434/TCP, which may be used to gain read/write access to the related TeamCenter station.\nCVE-2019-13929 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to Version 1.3, which can be obtained from a Siemens account manager.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nProtect network access to Port 1434/TCP of machines running SIMATIC IT UADM software.\nApply cell protection concept and implement defense-in-depth.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-984700 at the following location: http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
