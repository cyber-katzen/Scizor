EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Delta Electronics\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0DOPSoft\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Write\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DOPSoft, a human machine interface (HMI) editing software, are affected:\u00a0\n\nDOPSoft: versions 4.00.16.22 and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\u00a0\nDelta Electronics DOPSoft versions 4.00.16.22 and prior are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code when a malformed file is introduced to the software.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0123\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nDelta Electronics DOPSoft versions 4.00.16.22 and prior are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code when a malformed file is introduced to the software.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0124\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson), working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics released\u00a0version 1.3.0 of DIAScreen\u00a0(login required) and recommends users to use DIAScreen instead of DOPSoft.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
