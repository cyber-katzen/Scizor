EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Altair* **Equipment:**  HyperView Player* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use of Uninitialized Resource, Improper Validation of Array Index2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device accessed.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Altair HyperView Player, a standalone 3D viewer, are affected:* HyperView Player: Versions 2021\\.1\\.0\\.27 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) The software performs operations on a memory buffer but can read from or write to a memory location outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. This hits initially as a read access violation, leading to a memory corruption situation.[CVE\\-2022\\-2947](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2947)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [USE OF UNINITIALIZED RESOURCE CWE\\-908](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/908.html) The affected product is vulnerable to the use of uninitialized memory vulnerability during parsing of H3D files. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter leading to memory corruption.[CVE\\-2022\\-2949](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2949)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [USE OF UNINITIALIZED RESOURCE CWE\\-908](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/908.html) The affected product is vulnerable to the use of uninitialized memory vulnerability during parsing of H3D files. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter leading to memory corruption.[CVE\\-2022\\-2950](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2950)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER VALIDATION OF ARRAY INDEX CWE\\-129](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html) The affected product is vulnerable to improper validation of array index vulnerability during processing of H3D files. A DWORD value from a PoC file is extracted and used as an index to write to a buffer, leading to memory corruption.[CVE\\-2022\\-2951](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2951)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Information Technology* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Tran Van Khang of VinCSS reported these vulnerabilities to Trend Micro and Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitigation measures have been added to the latest version of [HyperView Player v2022\\.1](https://altairone.com/Marketplace?queryText=HyperView&app=HyperWorks&tab=Info)  . Altair One recommends users apply the update to mitigate these vulnerabilities. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
