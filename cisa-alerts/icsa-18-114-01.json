MITIGATIONS--------------- Vecna has released a recommended update to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Vecna recommends the following update process:* By default, VGo has automatic updates enabled so all updates are performed automatically when Internet access is available. If the VGo is powered off or in use, a message will appear on the screen asking if it can be updated when the VGo is next used.* If a VGo unit has automatic updates turned off, the update will not be downloaded (however, a notice about the update will be displayed on the VGo\u2019s screen). Vecna recommends that automatic updates be turned on. Select \u201csettings\u201d from the main menu then \u201cadvanced settings\u201d then \u201cautomatic updates.\u201d**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Vecna may have released an update for CVE\\-2018\\-8858\\. Vecna has not addressed CVE\\-2018\\-17931 and CVE\\-2018\\-17933\\. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Create strong credentials for the VGo XAMPP Client accounts.* Minimize who has access to the device.* Place physical locks over the USB ports. If possible, disable USB ports when not in use.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  NCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\\-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website.](/ics/)  Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
