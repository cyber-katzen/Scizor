EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal)\nVulnerability: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the following products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC PCS neo V4.0: all versions\nSIMATIC STEP 7 V16: all versions\nSIMATIC STEP 7 V17: all versions\nSIMATIC STEP 7 V18: versions prior to V18 Update 2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nAffected applications do not properly restrict the .NET BinaryFormatter when deserializing user-controllable input. This could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application. This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300.\nCVE-2022-45147 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2022-45147. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released a new version for SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) V18 and recommends updating to the latest version. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available:\n\nSIMATIC STEP 7 V18: Update to V18 Update 2 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAvoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in affected products\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-825651 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJuly 11, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
