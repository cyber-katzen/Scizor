EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: RTU500 series Bidirectional Communication Interface (BCI)\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to reboot the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following firmware versions of RTU500 series, a remote terminal unit, are affected:\n\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12.0: All versions\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12.2: All versions\nRTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12.4: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn issue exists in the BCI IEC 60870-5-104 function included in the affected products. If BCI IEC 60870-5-104 is enabled and configured, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the affected product, causing it to reboot. This vulnerability is caused by the validation error in the APDU parser of the BCI IEC 60870-5-104 function.\nCVE-2021-35533 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy recommends the following:\n\nDisable BCI IEC 60870-5-104 function by configuration if it is not used. Note: By default, the BCI IEC 60870-5-104 is disabled.\nUpdate to RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12.6.5.0 or later (e.g., RTU500 CMU Firmware Version 12.7.* or CMU Firmware Version 13.2.* or later).\n\nPlease see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000063 for additional mitigation and update information.\nHitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:\n\nPhysically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\nDo not directly connect to the Internet.\nSeparated from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of ports exposed.\nProcess control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails.\nPortable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
