EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 7\\.5**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor:** \n Hitachi Energy\n* **Equipment:** \n RTU500 series Bidirectional Communication Interface (BCI)\n* **Vulnerability:** \n Improper Input Validation\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to reboot the device.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following firmware versions of RTU500 series, a remote terminal unit, are affected:\n \n\n\n* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.0: All versions\n* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.2: All versions\n* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.4: All versions\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n An issue exists in the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function included in the affected products. If BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 is enabled and configured, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the affected product, causing it to reboot. This vulnerability is caused by the validation error in the APDU parser of the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-35533](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-35533) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Energy\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Switzerland\n\n\n### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n \n\n\n4\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy recommends the following:\n \n\n\n* Disable BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function by configuration if it is not used. Note: By default, the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 is disabled.\n* Update to RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.6\\.5\\.0 or later (e.g., RTU500 CMU Firmware Version 12\\.7\\.\\* or CMU Firmware Version 13\\.2\\.\\* or later).\n\n\n\n Please see Hitachi Energy advisory\n [8DBD000063](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?utm_campaign=2021.11_5282_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_content=2021.11_5282_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&DocumentID=8DBD000063&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch&elqTrackId=af857fe4745f4180a42aa0778f76b1b9&elq=38e0453737cf4db980910db6ef0c9e36&elqaid=3812&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=3243) \n for additional mitigation and update information.\n \n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:\n \n\n\n* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\n* Do not directly connect to the Internet.\n* Separated from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of ports exposed.\n* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.\n* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Hitachi Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-21-336-04) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2021-35533"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-21-336-04", "title": "Hitachi Energy RTU500 series BCI | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "18c5cf2185f284837b462508ae0020ce59cb517de16d5b829eb768202fe49bb0"}
