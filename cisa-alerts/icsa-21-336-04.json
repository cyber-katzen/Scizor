[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHitachi Energy RTU500 series BCI================================ Last Revised December 02, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-21\\-336\\-041\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  RTU500 series Bidirectional Communication Interface (BCI)* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to reboot the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following firmware versions of RTU500 series, a remote terminal unit, are affected:* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.0: All versions* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.2: All versions* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.4: All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) An issue exists in the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function included in the affected products. If BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 is enabled and configured, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the affected product, causing it to reboot. This vulnerability is caused by the validation error in the APDU parser of the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function.[CVE\\-2021\\-35533](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-35533)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends the following:* Disable BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 function by configuration if it is not used. Note: By default, the BCI IEC 60870\\-5\\-104 is disabled.* Update to RTU500 series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.6\\.5\\.0 or later (e.g., RTU500 CMU Firmware Version 12\\.7\\.\\* or CMU Firmware Version 13\\.2\\.\\* or later). Please see Hitachi Energy advisory [8DBD000063](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?utm_campaign=2021.11_5282_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_content=2021.11_5282_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&DocumentID=8DBD000063&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch&elqTrackId=af857fe4745f4180a42aa0778f76b1b9&elq=38e0453737cf4db980910db6ef0c9e36&elqaid=3812&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=3243)  for additional mitigation and update information. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Do not directly connect to the Internet.* Separated from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of ports exposed.* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
