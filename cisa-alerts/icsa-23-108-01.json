This could allow an attacker to access the file system (via memory card or EM file memory) and obtain all available sensitive information.[CVE\\-2022\\-45794](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-45794)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Reid Wightman of Dragos reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- OMRON recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.* Enable the FINS write protection function.* Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks preventing untrusted devices from accessing them.* Implement firewalls:* Shut down unused communications ports* Limit communications hosts* Limit access to FINS port (9600\\)* Isolate control systems and equipment from the IT network.* Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.* Use strong passwords and change them frequently.* Install physical controls, only permitting authorized personnel access to control systems and equipment.* Use malware scanning tools to ensure safety of any USB drives or other portable devices before connecting them to control systems and devices.* Enforce multifactor authentication on all devices with remote access to control systems and equipment when possible.* Protect hosts with access to the control system against malware and Ensure installation and maintenance of up\\-to\\-date, antivirus software on hosts with access to control systems.* Complete validation processing, such as backup and range checks, to cope with unintentional modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.* Complete periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
