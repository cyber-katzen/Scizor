This advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained through FBI investigations as recently as November 2023\\.\n \n\n\n\n Scattered Spider is a cybercriminal group that targets large companies and their contracted information technology (IT) help desks. Scattered Spider threat actors, per trusted third parties, have typically engaged in data theft for extortion and have also been known to utilize BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware alongside their usual TTPs.\n \n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of a cyberattack by Scattered Spider actors.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-320A Scattered Spider](/sites/default/files/2023-11/aa23-320a_scattered_spider_0.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 510\\.78 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 14\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae \n Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\") \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Overview**\n\n\n\n Scattered Spider (also known as Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, and Muddled Libra) engages in data extortion and several other criminal activities.\\[\n [1](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/groups/G1015/ \"Scattered Spider\") \n ] Scattered Spider threat actors are considered experts in social engineering and use multiple social engineering techniques, especially phishing, push bombing, and subscriber identity module (SIM) swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi\\-factor authentication (MFA). According to public reporting, Scattered Spider threat actors have \\[\n [2](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/scattered-spider-the-modus-operandi.html \"Scattered Spider: The Modus Operandi\") \n ],\\[\n [3](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/ \"Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies\") \n ],\\[\n [4](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid-detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/ \"SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security Deficiencies with Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver Tactic in Attempt to Bypass Endpoint Security\") \n ]:\n \n\n\n* Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain credentials from employees and gain access to the network \\[\n [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/ \"Phishing for Information\") \n ],\\[\n [T1656](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1656/ \"Impersonation\") \n ].\n* Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff to direct employees to run commercial remote access tools enabling initial access \\[\n [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1204/ \"User Execution\") \n ],\\[\n [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\") \n ],\\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\") \n ].\n* Posed as IT staff to convince employees to share their one\\-time password (OTP), an MFA authentication code.\n* Sent repeated MFA notification prompts leading to employees pressing the \u201cAccept\u201d button (also known as MFA fatigue) \\[\n [T1621](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1621/ \"Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation\") \n ].\\[\n [5](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware-group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise \"Ransomware group steps up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise\") \n ]\n* Convinced cellular carriers to transfer control of a targeted user\u2019s phone number to a SIM card they controlled, gaining control over the phone and access to MFA prompts.\n* Monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by ransomware and data theft \\[\n [T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/ \"Financial Theft\") \n ].\n\n\n\n After gaining access to networks, the FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly available, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Table 1 details a list of legitimate tools Scattered Spider, repurposed and used for their criminal activity.\n **Note:** \n The use of these legitimate tools alone is not indicative of criminal activity. Users should review the Scattered Spider indicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs discussed in this CSA to determine whether they have been compromised.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Legitimate Tools Used by Scattered Spider* \n\n| **Tool** | **Intended Use** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fleetdeck.io | Enables remote monitoring and management of systems. |\n| Level.io | Enables remote monitoring and management of systems. |\n| Mimikatz \\[  [S0002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0002/ \"Mimikatz\")   ] | Extracts credentials from a system. |\n| Ngrok \\[  [S0508](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0508/ \"ngrok\")   ] | Enables remote access to a local web server by tunneling over the internet. |\n| Pulseway | Enables remote monitoring and management of systems. |\n| Screenconnect | Enables remote connections to network devices for management. |\n| Splashtop | Enables remote connections to network devices for management. |\n| Tactical.RMM | Enables remote monitoring and management of systems. |\n| Tailscale | Provides virtual private networks (VPNs) to secure network communications. |\n| Teamviewer | Enables remote connections to network devices for management. |\n\n\n\n In addition to using legitimate tools, Scattered Spider also uses malware as part of its TTPs. See Table 2 for some of the malware used by Scattered Spider.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 2: Malware Used by Scattered Spider* \n\n| **Malware** | **Use** |\n| --- | --- |\n| AveMaria (also known as WarZone \\[  [S0670](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0670/ \"WarzoneRAT\")   ]) | Enables remote access to a victim\u2019s systems. |\n| Raccoon Stealer | Steals information including login credentials \\[  [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0006/ \"Credential Access\")   ], browser history \\[  [T1217](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1217/ \"Browser Information Discovery\")   ], cookies \\[  [T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1539/ \"Steal Web Session Cookie\")   ], and other data. |\n| VIDAR Stealer | Steals information including login credentials, browser history, cookies, and other data. |\n\n\n\n Scattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off the land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently modifying their TTPs.\n \n\n\n\n Observably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ] after gaining access and threatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites including U.S.\\-based data centers and MEGA\\[.]NZ \\[\n [T1567\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1567/002/ \"Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Recent Scattered Spider TTPs**\n\n\n##### ***New TTP \\- File Encryption***\n\n\n\n More recently, the FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after exfiltration \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors communicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications.\n \n\n\n##### ***Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access***\n\n\n\n Scattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing \\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\") \n ] and smishing \\[\n [T1660](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1660/ \"Phishing (Mobile)\") \n ] attempts against a target using victim\\-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3 \\[\n [T1583\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/001/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Domains\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors* \n\n| **Domains** |\n| --- |\n| victimname\\-sso\\[.]com |\n| victimname\\-servicedesk\\[.]com |\n| victimname\\-okta\\[.]com |\n\n\n\n In most instances, Scattered Spider threat actors conduct SIM swapping attacks against users that respond to the phishing/smishing attempt. The threat actors then work to identify the personally identifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing, obtaining answers for those users\u2019 security questions. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII \\[\n [T1589](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information\") \n ], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques \\[\n [T1656](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1656/ \"Impersonation\") \n ] to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens \\[\n [T1078\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/002/ \"Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts\") \n ],\\[\n [T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1199/ \"Trusted Relationship\") \n ],\\[\n [T1566\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/004/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Voice\") \n ] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign\\-on (SSO) environments.\n \n\n\n##### ***Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation***\n\n\n\n Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens \\[\n [T1556\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1556/006/ \"Modify Authentication Process: Multi-Factor Authentication\") \n ],\\[\n [T1606](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1606/ \"Forge Web Credentials\") \n ] after compromising a user\u2019s account to establish persistence \\[\n [TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0003/ \"Persistence\") \n ]. Further, the threat actors add a federated identity provider to the victim\u2019s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking \\[\n [T1484\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1484/002/ \"Domain Policy Modification: Domain Trust Modification\") \n ]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO account attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider and then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the threat actors to perform privileged escalation \\[\n [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0004/ \"Privilege Escalation\") \n ] and continue logging in even when passwords are changed \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ]. Additionally, they leverage common endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools installed on the victim networks to take advantage of the tools\u2019 remote\\-shell capabilities and executing of commands which elevates their access. They also deploy remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools \\[\n [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\") \n ] to then maintain persistence.\n \n\n\n##### ***Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration***\n\n\n\n Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites \\[\n [T1213\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1213/002/ \"Data from Information Repositories: Sharepoint\") \n ], credential storage documentation \\[\n [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/001/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\") \n ], VMware vCenter infrastructure \\[\n [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\") \n ], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) \\[\n [TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0007/ \"Discovery\") \n ]. The threat actors enumerate the victim\u2019s Active Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim\u2019s code repositories \\[\n [T1213\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1213/003/ \"Data from Information Repositories: Code Repositories\") \n ], code\\-signing certificates \\[\n [T1552\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/004/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys\") \n ], and source code \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\") \n ],\\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ]. Threat actors activate Amazon Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory \\[\n [T1538](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1538/ \"Cloud Service Dashboard\") \n ] to discover targets for lateral movement \\[\n [TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0007/ \"Discovery\") \n ],\\[\n [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0008/ \"Lateral Movement\") \n ], then move to both preexisting \\[\n [T1021\\.007](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/007/ \"Remote Services: Cloud Services\") \n ] and actor\\-created \\[\n [T1578\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1578/002/ \"Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Create Cloud Instance\") \n ] Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2\\) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data exfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor\\-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools \\[\n [T1648](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1648/ \"Serverless Execution\") \n ] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database \\[\n [T1074](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1074/ \"Data Staged\") \n ],\\[\n [T1530](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1530/ \"Data from Cloud Storage\") \n ]. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat actors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks\u2014thereby encrypting VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider threat actors often search the victim\u2019s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for emails \\[\n [T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1114/ \"Email Collection\") \n ] or conversations regarding the threat actor\u2019s intrusion and any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in response to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the environment \\[\n [T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1136/ \"Create Account\") \n ] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles \\[\n [T1585\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1585/001/ \"Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts\") \n ] to backstop newly created identities.\n \n\n\n### **MITRE ATT\\&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES**\n\n\n\n See Tables 4 through 17 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 4: Reconnaissance* \n\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gather Victim Identity Information | [T1589](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information\") | Scattered Spider threat actors gather usernames, passwords, and PII for targeted organizations. |\n| Phishing for Information | [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/ \"Phishing for Information\") | Scattered Spider threat actors use phishing to obtain login credentials, gaining access to a victim\u2019s network. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 5: Resource Development* \n\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Acquire Infrastructure: Domains | [T1583\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/001/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Domains\") | Scattered Spider threat actors create domains for use in phishing and smishing attempts against targeted organizations. |\n| Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts | [T1585\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1585/001/ \"Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts\") | Scattered Spider threat actors create fake social media profiles to backstop newly created user accounts in a targeted organization. |\n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 6: Initial Access* \n\n| **Technique Title** | **ID** | **Use** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Phishing | [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\") | Scattered Spider threat actors use broad phishing attempts against a target to obtain information used to gain initial access.

The FBI and CISA recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles and tactics into their software development practices limiting the impact of ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the secure posture for their customers.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design and Default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage and\n [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture based on the threat actor activity and to reduce the risk of compromise by Scattered Spider threat actors. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n* **Implement application controls** \n to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs. Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n* **Reduce threat of malicious actors** \n using remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Auditing remote access tools** \n\t on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized software.\n\t+ **Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software** \n\t to detect abnormal use of programs running as a portable executable \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.T](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t\n\t ].\n\t+ **Using security software** \n\t to detect instances of remote access software being loaded only in memory.\n\t+ **Requiring authorized remote access solutions** \n\t to be used only from within your network over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs).\n\t+ **Blocking both inbound and outbound connections** \n\t on common remote access software ports and protocols at the network perimeter.\n\t+ **Applying recommendations** \n\t in the\n\t [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\") \n\t .\n* **Implementing FIDO/WebAuthn authentication or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\\-based MFA** \n . These MFA implementations are resistant to phishing and not suspectable to push bombing or SIM swap attacks, which are techniques known to be used by Scattered Spider actors. See CISA\u2019s fact sheet\n [Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n for more information.\n* **Strictly limit the use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other remote desktop services** \n . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]:\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ [Apply phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n\t\n\t .\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n\n\n\n In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data** \n and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption to its business practices \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Require all accounts** \n with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\n **to comply** \n with\n [NIST's standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Implement password policies in compliance with NIST\u2019s standards.\n\t+ Use \u201cstrong\u201d passwords that are unique and random, as well as contain at least sixteen characters and no more than 64 characters in length \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.B](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Consider implementing industry\\-recognized password managers that align with organizational technology procurement policies.\n\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.G](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\n\t+ Refrain from requiring recurring password changes.\n\t   \n\t\n\t**Note:** \n\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)** \n for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \n in internet\\-facing systems \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Segment networks** \n to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software** \n on all hosts.\n* **Disable unused** \n**ports and protocols** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.V](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\n ].\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Disable hyperlinks** \n in received emails.\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n ].\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI and CISA recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 4\\-17\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **REPORTING**\n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA are seeking any information that can be shared, to include a sample ransom note, communications with Scattered Spider group actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.
