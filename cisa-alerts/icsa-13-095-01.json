Cogent has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAffected Products\nCogent Real-Time Systems reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following versions:\n\nCogent DataHub Version 7.2.2 and earlier,\nOPC DataHub Version 6.4.21 and earlier,\nCascade DataHub for Windows Version 6.4.21 and earlier,\nDataSim and DataPid demonstration clients for Cogent DataHub V7.2.2,\nDataSim and DataPid demonstration clients for OPC DataHub and Cascade DataHub V6.4.21, and\nDataHub QuickTrend Version 7.2.2 and earlier.\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities will cause the affected programs to terminate, causing a denial of service (DoS). Other exploitations of these vulnerabilities may also allow an attacker to alter the program stack or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the applications.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nCogent Real-Time Systems, Inc. is a Canadian-based company that produces middleware applications that are used to interface with control systems.\nCogent\u2019s products are deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, building automation, chemical, banking and finance, electric utilities, and others. These products are used worldwide, primarily in the United States and Great Britain.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nImproper Input ValidationCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed April 04, 2013.\nThe DataHub application accepts formatted text commands via a TCP connection on Ports 4502/ TCP and 4503/TCP. These commands are parsed, validated, and executed within the application. The parser contains an error where malformed input will cause the parser to perform a reference through a NULL pointer, causing the application to crash.\nCVE-2013-0681 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).\nBuffer OverflowCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed April 04, 2013.\nThe DataHub application contains a built-in Web server that will accept HTTP requests via Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP. An attacker could send an HTTP request with an unusually long header parameter, causing a stack buffer overflow within the Web server. Typically, this will lead to an application crash, causing a DoS. In theory, a carefully constructed header could be used to overwrite the stack in a predictable way, leading to arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2013-0680 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C).\nInvalid PointerCWE-763: Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/763.html, Web site last accessed April 04, 2013.\nThe DataSim and DataPid programs connect to the DataHub via a TCP connection. Information and commands are exchanged via formatted text messages over this connection. If the user connects DataSim or DataPid to a server other than the DataHub, and this server is designed to generate random or malformed messages, then DataSim and DataPid could crash.\nIn order to exploit this scenario, an attacker would need to induce the user to connect DataSim and DataPid to a server other than the DataHub. The simple act of inducing this connection would mean that the data produced by DataPid and DataSim would not be connected to the production system and no data would be delivered to the DataHub. Subsequently, causing DataSim and DataPid to crash would produce no further negative effect on the system.\nDataSim and DataPid are not used in production systems and do not pose a risk.\nCVE-2013-0683 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).\nImproper Exception HandlingCWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755.html , Web site last accessed April 04, 2013.\nThe DataHub application accepts formatted text commands via a TCP connection. These commands are parsed, validated, and executed within the application. When the parser is sent random data, it may access memory beyond the end of an allocated heap buffer, causing a crash. It may also access memory beyond the end of a stack buffer, providing an opportunity for a carefully crafted message to modify the stack to allow code execution.\nCVE-2013-0682 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities. It would require a more skilled attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nMitigation\nCogent recommends the following mitigation strategies:\n\nTurn off Ports 4502/TCP and 4503/TCP if they are not being used. This can be done in the Tunnel/Mirror properties of the DataHub\nIf access to the application from the Internet is not required, block Ports 4502/TCP and 4503/TCP at your firewall, and only allow connections on these ports from within your local area network.\nIf the DataHub Web server is not being used, turn it off in the Web server properties.\nIf access to DataHub from the Internet is not required, block Port 80/TCP at your firewall, and only allow connections on this port from within your local area network.\nThis vulnerability is fixed in the following software versions. Upgrade to one of these applications.\nDataHub QuickTrend Version 7.3.0\nCogent DataHub Version 7.3.0\nOPC DataHub Version 6.4.22\nCascade DataHub for Windows Version 6.4.22.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\n",
