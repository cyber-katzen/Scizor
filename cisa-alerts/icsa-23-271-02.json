EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.0*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : DEXMA* **Equipment**  : DEXGate* **Vulnerabilities**  : Cross\\-Site Scripting, Cross\\-Site Request Forgery, Improper Authentication, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the attacker impersonating a user, executing arbitrary code, and accessing the connected network.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following version of DEXGate is affected:* DEXGate: Version 20130114### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to a cross\\-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to access the web application to introduce arbitrary Java Script by injecting an XSS payload into the 'hostname' parameter of the vulnerable software.[CVE\\-2023\\-40153](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40153)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [CROSS\\-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE\\-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to a cross\\-site request forgery vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to perform actions with the permissions of a victim user.[CVE\\-2023\\-42435](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-42435)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to an improper authentication vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user as long as the device keeps the session active, since the attack takes advantage of the cookie header to generate \"legitimate\" requests.[CVE\\-2023\\-41089](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41089)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to a cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability, which may allow an attacker with access to the network, where clients have access to the DexGate server, could capture traffic. The attacker can later us the information within it to access the application.[CVE\\-2023\\-41088](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-41088)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE\\-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to an exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to create malicious requests for obtaining the information of the version about the web server used.[CVE\\-2023\\-42666](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-42666)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Spain### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Aar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez of S21sec reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Dexma has not responded to CISA's requests to coordinate at this time. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
