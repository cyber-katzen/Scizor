EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: DEXMA\nEquipment: DEXGate\nVulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Improper Authentication, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the attacker impersonating a user, executing arbitrary code, and accessing the connected network.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of DEXGate is affected:\n\nDEXGate: Version 20130114\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to access the web application to introduce arbitrary Java Script by injecting an XSS payload into the 'hostname' parameter of the vulnerable software.\nCVE-2023-40153\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to perform actions with the permissions of a victim user.\nCVE-2023-42435\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an improper authentication vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user as long as the device keeps the session active, since the attack takes advantage of the cookie header to generate \"legitimate\" requests.\nCVE-2023-41089\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability, which may allow an attacker with access to the network, where clients have access to the DexGate server, could capture traffic. The attacker can later us the information within it to access the application.\nCVE-2023-41088\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to create malicious requests for obtaining the information of the version about the web server used.\nCVE-2023-42666\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Spain\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez of S21sec reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDexma has not responded to CISA's requests to coordinate at this time.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
