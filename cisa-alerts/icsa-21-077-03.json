MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi ABB Power Grids has published an [advisory for eSOMS Telerik](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107991A8943&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  and advises users to update to eSOMS Version 6\\.3 as soon as possible. For additional information and support, contact a product provider or Hitachi ABB Power Grids service organization. For contact information, visit [Hitachi ABB Power Grids contact\\-centers](https://www.hitachiabb-powergrids.com/contact-us/)  . Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include ensuring applications and servers are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that must be evaluated case by case. Sensitive application servers should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
