EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Sielco\nEquipment: PolyEco1000\nVulnerabilities: Session Fixation, Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to escalate privileges, access restricted pages, or hijack sessions.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Sielco PolyEco1000, a FM transmitter, are affected:\n\nPolyEco1000: CPU:2.0.6 FPGA:10.19\nPolyEco1000: CPU:1.9.4 FPGA:10.19\nPolyEco1000: CPU:1.9.3 FPGA:10.19\nPolyEco500: CPU:1.7.0 FPGA:10.16\nPolyEco300: CPU:2.0.2 FPGA:10.19\nPolyEco300: CPU:2.0.0 FPGA:10.19\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0SESSION FIXATION CWE-384\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to a session hijack vulnerability due to the cookie being vulnerable to a brute force attack, lack of SSL, and the session being visible in requests.\nCVE-2023-0897\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nSielco PolyEco1000 uses a weak set of default administrative credentials that can be easily guessed in remote password attacks and gain full control of the system.\nCVE-2023-5754\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to an attacker escalating their privileges by modifying passwords in POST requests.\nCVE-2023-46661\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability due to improper access control enforcement. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this via a specially crafted request to gain access to sensitive information.\nCVE-2023-46662\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to an attacker bypassing authorization and accessing resources behind protected pages. The application interface allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests.\nCVE-2023-46663\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to an improper access control vulnerability when the application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization and access resources behind protected pages.\nCVE-2023-46664\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSielco PolyEco1000 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability due to an attacker modifying passwords in a POST request and gain unauthorized access to the affected device with administrative privileges.\nCVE-2023-46665\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Italy\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof of concept as authored by Gjoko Krstic of ZeroScience.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSielco has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of affected versions of Sielco PolyEco FM Transmitter are invited to contact Sielco\u00a0customer support\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n5.
