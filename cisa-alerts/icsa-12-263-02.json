This vulnerability grants attackers administrative access to the device. ICS-CERT has been unable to successfully coordinate this vulnerability with ORing Industrial Networking because of the vendor\u2019s unresponsiveness. ICS-CERT is unaware of any fix by ORing Industrial Networking that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely. Exploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAffected Products\nThe following ORing Industrial Networking products are known to be affected:\n\nIndustrial DIN-Rail Device Server IDS-5042, all versions, and\nIndustrial DIN-Rail Device Server IDS-5042+, all versions.\n\nNote: Other ORing Industrial Networking products may also be affected by this vulnerability.\nImpact\nAttackers can exploit the product by using the default hard-coded credential to log into the device with administrative privileges. Once access is gained, the attacker can read and write to files and change settings. This access level can impact the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the product.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nORing Industrial Networking is based in Taiwan and maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, Korea, and China.The affected products are industrial serial device servers used for SCADA systems. According to ORing\u2019s Web siteORing Industrial Networking Corp., http://www.oring-networking.com/, Web site last visited September 19, 2012. are deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, oil and gas, transportation, electric utilities, and others. ICS-CERT estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nUse of Hard-Coded CredentialsCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html, CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, Web site last accessed September 18, 2012.\nAn attacker can log into the operating system of the device using an SSH connection with the root credentials to gain administrative access. Once the attacker gains access to the device, the file system and settings can be accessed, which could result in a loss of availability, integrity and confidentiality.CVE-2012-4577NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4577, Web site last visited September 19, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), Web site last visited September 19, 2012.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nExploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\nICS-CERT is not aware of ORing Industrial Networking developing a patch, update, or fix for the affected products. The ORing software update Web siteORing Industrial DIN-Rail Device Server Update, http://www.oring-networking.com/support/product/sn/19, Web site last visited September 19, 2012. does not indicate that a new version of firmware or security patch is available.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html, Web site last accessed September 19, 2012.\u00a0 ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies.Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01A.pdf, Web site last accessed September 19, 2012.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\u00a0\n",
