EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: GE\nEquipment: CARESCAPE Telemetry Server, ApexPro Telemetry Server, CARESCAPE Central Station (CSCS) and Clinical Information Center (CIC) systems, CARESCAPE B450, B650, B850 Monitors\nVulnerabilities: Unprotected Storage of Credentials, Improper Input Validation, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inadequate Encryption Strength\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could occur when an attacker gains access to the mission critical (MC) and/or information exchange (IX) networks due to improper configuration or physical access to devices. An exploit could result in a loss of monitoring and/or loss of alarms during active patient monitoring. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, may allow an attacker to obtain PHI data, make changes at the operating system level of the device, with effects such as rendering the device unusable, otherwise interfering with the function of the device and/or making certain changes to alarm settings on connected patient monitors, and/or utilizing services used for remote viewing and control of devices on the network to access the clinical user interface and make changes to device settings and alarm limits, which could result in missed or unnecessary alarms or silencing of some alarms.\n3.

MITIGATIONS\nGE recommends users confirm the proper configuration of the MC and IX networks to ensure that the isolation and configuration meet the requirements listed in the Patient Monitoring Network Configuration Guide, CARESCAPE Network Configuration Guide, and product technical and service manuals. These can be obtained by contacting GE via the customer support portal with a valid support account. A properly isolated network requires an attacker to gain physical access in order to carry out an exploit.\nGE recommends that, in addition to applying network management best practices, users ensure:\n\nThe MC and IX Networks are isolated and if connectivity is needed outside the MC and/or IX Networks, a Router/Firewall is used to allow only the necessary data flows and block all other data flows.\nMC and IX Router/Firewall should be set up to block all incoming traffic initiated from outside the network, with exceptions for needed clinical data flows. The following ports should always be blocked for traffic initiated from outside the MC and IX Networks: TCP Port 22 for SSH and TCP and UDP Ports 137, 138, 139, and 445 for NetBIOS and SMB as well as TCP Ports 10000, 5225, 5800, 5900, and 10001.\u00a0\nRestricted physical access to Central Stations, Telemetry Servers, and the MC and IX networks.\nDefault passwords for Webmin should be changed as recommended.\nPassword management best practices are followed.\n\nAt the time of the publication of this advisory, GE was not aware of any reported incidences of a cyber attack in a clinical use or any reported injuries associated with any of these vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, GE is developing software updates/patches with additional security enhancements. In accordance with GE\u2019s continual cybersecurity hygiene process, users can access GE\u2019s security website to receive the most up-to-date information and subscribe to receive notifications when new updates/patches are available.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate Medical system networks and remote devices behind firewalls; isolate them from the business network. Only if connectivity is required outside the MC or IX network should a firewall/router be used with very strict rules allowing only very explicit network flows.\nWhere additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.\nAdditionally, the FDA has created a safety communication.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
