EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: User Management Component (UMC)\nVulnerabilities: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains, Cross-site Scripting, Classic Buffer Overflow, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a restart of the UMC server.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the following products are affected:\n\nOpcenter Quality: all versions\nSIMATIC PCS neo: versions prior to v4.1\nSINUMERIK Integrate RunMyHMI\u00a0/Automotive: all versions\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) v14: all versions\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) v15.1: all versions\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) v16: all versions\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) v17: all versions\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) v18: versions prior to V18 update 3\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0PERMISSIVE CROSS-DOMAIN POLICY WITH UNTRUSTED DOMAINS CWE-942\nWhen accessing the UMC Web-UI from affected products, UMC uses an overly permissive CORS policy. This could allow an attacker to trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior.\nCVE-2023-46281\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected applications that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The code could be potentially executed later by another (possibly privileged) user.\nCVE-2023-46282\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the application. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.\nCVE-2023-46283\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the application. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.\nCVE-2023-46284\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected application contains an improper input validation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bring the service into a denial-of-service state by sending a specifically crafted message to 4004/tcp. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash is detected by a watchdog.\nCVE-2023-46285\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.\n\nSIMATIC PCS neo:\u00a0Update to V4.1 or later version\nTotally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V18:\u00a0Update to V18 Update 3 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nDo not access links from untrusted sources.\nIf only one UMC server is used, block access to port 4002/tcp e.g. with an external firewall.\nIf only one RT server is used, block access to port 4004/tcp e.g. with an external firewall. If the deployment contains no RT-Servers, block the port in the local firewall.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-999588 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
