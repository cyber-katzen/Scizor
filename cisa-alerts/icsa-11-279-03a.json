SSL.\u201d/n Software: IP*Works! SSL, http://www.nsoftware.com/ipworks/ssl/, website last accessed October 12, 2011.\n--------- Begin End A Part 1 of 3 --------\nIP*Works! is used in the UniOPC product. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash and could result in the execution of arbitrary code.\nIndustrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) has coordinated with Unitronics and the security researchers. Unitronics has released a new version that does not contain the vulnerable component. The researchers have confirmed that the vulnerable component is not present in the new version. However, customers installing the new version on a system that had previously contained an affected version of UniOPC are still vulnerable as the update does not remove the vulnerable component.\nAffected Products\nThis vulnerability affects versions of Unitronics UniOPC prior to Version 2.0.0.\nImpact\nExploitation of this vulnerability could result in the execution of arbitrary code on a system running an affected version of the Unitronics UniOPC product.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 --------\nUnitronics is based in Israel. UniOPC Server provides the ability to read and write data between Unitronics programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and other OPC applications.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 3 --------\nUniOPC Server is a standalone product that runs independently of other Unitronics software. According to Unitronics, UniOPC is used worldwide in multiple sectors.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nThis vulnerability resides in the https50.ocx component of \u201cIP*Works! SSL\u201d that is used as part of the Unitronics UniOPC product.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nAn attacker could build a specially crafted website that accesses the vulnerable function to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low to medium skill level may exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\nUnitronics has released Version 2.0.0 of UniOPC Server. Unitronics recommends that users of all versions of the UniOPC Server product download and install Version 2.0.0 or newer from the following location: http://www.unitronics.com/Content.aspx?page=Downloads.\nUnitronics has not provided mitigation steps for existing customers who are currently using affected versions of UniOPC. The vulnerable component will remain on the system even after the new version has been installed.\nTo manually remove the vulnerable component, the researcher suggests the following steps:\n\nEnsure that no other applications are using https50.ocx prior to its removal.\nFrom a command prompt type: regsvr32 /U c:\\windows\\system32\\https50.ocx\nDelete the c:\\windows\\system32\\https50.ocx file.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nIn addition to installing the latest version of UniOPC Server, ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect their systems from this and other vulnerabilities.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control system security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
