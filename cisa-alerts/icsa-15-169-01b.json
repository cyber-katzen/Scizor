[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryWind River VXWorks TCP Predictability Vulnerability in ICS Devices (Update B)============================================================================= Last Revised February 04, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-169\\-01BOVERVIEW-------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the updated advisory titled ICSA\\-15\\-169\\-01A Wind River VxWorks TCP Predictability Vulnerability in ICS Devices that was published November\u00a05,\u00a02015, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site. Raheem Beyah, David Formby, and San Shin Jung of Georgia Tech, via a research project partially sponsored by the Georgia Tech National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center, have identified a TCP predictability vulnerability that exists in Wind River\u2019s VxWorks embedded software. Wind River has produced patches for several versions of VxWorks that mitigates this vulnerability. The researchers have verified that Schneider Electric\u2019s SAGE RTU patch, which uses Wind River\u2019s VxWorks Version 6\\.9\\.4\\.4, resolves the vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of VxWorks are affected:* Wind River VxWorks, Version 7, released prior to February 13, 2015,* Wind River VxWorks, Version 6\\.9 releases prior to Version 6\\.9\\.4\\.4,* Wind River VxWorks, Version 6\\.8 releases prior to Version 6\\.8\\.3,* Wind River VxWorks, Version 6\\.7 releases prior to Version 6\\.7\\.1\\.1, and* Wind River VxWorks, Version 6\\.6 and prior versions, but NOT to include Version 5\\.5\\.1 with PNE2\\.2 and Version 6\\.0 through Version 6\\.4\\.

Customers may obtain this patch by contacting Schneider Electric\u2019s customer service department at: 1\\-713\\-920\\-6832\\. For all other SAGE RTU models, contact Schneider Electric\u2019s customer service department at: 1\\-713\\-920\\-6832\\. Schneider Electric has released Security Notification, SEVD\\-2015\\-162\\-01, which is available at the following URL: http://www.schneider\\-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2015\\-162\\-01 Schneider Electric recommends the following interim mitigations until patches can be applied:* Enable SAGE RTU security features, so that network traffic is encrypted and authenticated,* Use strong passwords, and* Implement extensive logging of network traffic. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Implement a bump\\-in\\-the\\-wire solution that can provide secure communication between endpoints, which may enhance security.* Effectively segment networks and implement demilitarized zones (DMZs) with properly configured firewalls to selectively control and monitor traffic passed between zones.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. 14\\.00 This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.Vendor------* Wind River-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-15-169-01b)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01) Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02) Jul 16, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01) Jul 11, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
