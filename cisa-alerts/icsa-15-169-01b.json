Wind River has produced patches for several versions of VxWorks that mitigates this vulnerability. The researchers have verified that Schneider Electric\u2019s SAGE RTU patch, which uses Wind River\u2019s VxWorks Version 6.9.4.4, resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of VxWorks are affected:\n\nWind River VxWorks, Version 7, released prior to February 13, 2015,\nWind River VxWorks, Version 6.9 releases prior to Version 6.9.4.4,\nWind River VxWorks, Version 6.8 releases prior to Version 6.8.3,\nWind River VxWorks, Version 6.7 releases prior to Version 6.7.1.1, and\nWind River VxWorks, Version 6.6 and prior versions, but NOT to include Version 5.5.1 with PNE2.2 and Version 6.0 through Version 6.4.\n\nThe following versions of VxWorks Cert are affected:\n\nWind River VxWorks Cert, Version 6.6.3,\nWind River VxWorks Cert, Version 6.6.4, and\nWind River VxWorks Cert, Version 6.6.4.1.\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 3 --------\nThe following versions of VxWorks 653 are affected:\n\nWind River VxWorks 653 Platform/Platform for Safety Critical ARINC 653, Version 3.0,\nWind River VxWorks 653 Platform/Platform for Safety Critical ARINC 653, Version 2.5,\nWind River VxWorks 653 Platform/Platform for Safety Critical ARINC 653, Version 2.4,\nWind River VxWorks 653 Platform/Platform for Safety Critical ARINC 653, Version 2.3, and\nWind River VxWorks 653 Platform/Platform for Safety Critical ARINC 653, Version 2.2.\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 3 ----------\nWind River\u2019s VxWorks is widely used in ICS-related devices. NCCIC/ICS-CERT has notified many ICS vendors in the US and abroad of the predictable TCP sequence vulnerability in the VxWorks software. The identified ICS vendor responded to ICS-CERT\u2019s notification and coordinated with ICS-CERT to remediate the identified product vulnerability.\nThe following Schneider Electric SAGE RTUs, which use CPU card C3412 are affected:\n\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1210 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1230 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1250 RTU, and\nSchneider Electric SAGE 2200 RTU.\n\nThe following Schneider Electric SAGE RTUs, which use CPU card C3413 are affected:\n\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1310 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1330 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1350 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 2300 RTU, and\nSchneider Electric SAGE 3030 RTU.\n\nThe following Schneider Electric SAGE RTUs, which use CPU card C3414 LX-800 with firmware versions prior to C3414-500-S02J2 are affected:\n\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1410 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1430 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 1450 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 2400 RTU,\nSchneider Electric SAGE 3030 Magnum RTU, and\nSchneider Electric SAGE LANDAC2 Upgrade Kit.\n\nICS-CERT will update the list of affected products as vendors identify their product patches and new product versions.\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to spoof or disrupt TCP connections of affected devices.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nWind River is a US-based company that sells products around the world.

Customers may obtain this patch by contacting Schneider Electric\u2019s customer service department at: 1-713-920-6832.\nFor all other SAGE RTU models, contact Schneider Electric\u2019s customer service department at:1-713-920-6832.\nSchneider Electric has released Security Notification, SEVD-2015-162-01, which is available at the following URL:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2015-162-01\nSchneider Electric recommends the following interim mitigations until patches can be applied:\n\nEnable SAGE RTU security features, so that network traffic is encrypted and authenticated,\nUse strong passwords, and\nImplement extensive logging of network traffic.\n\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nImplement a bump-in-the-wire solution that can provide secure communication between endpoints, which may enhance security.\nEffectively segment networks and implement demilitarized zones (DMZs) with properly configured firewalls to selectively control and monitor traffic passed between zones.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n  14.00\n",
