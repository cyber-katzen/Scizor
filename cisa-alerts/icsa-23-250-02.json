MITIGATIONS\nPhoenix Contact has made the following fixed versions available and encourages users to download the latest version:\n\nTC ROUTER 3002T-4G\nTC ROUTER 3002T-4G ATT\nTC ROUTER 3002T-4G VZW\nTC CLOUD CLIENT 1002-4G\nTC CLOUD CLIENT 1002-4G ATT\nTC CLOUD CLIENT 1002-4G VZW\nCLOUD CLIENT 1101T-TX/TX\n\nPhoenix Contact recommends operating network-capable devices in closed networks or protected with a suitable firewall. For detailed information on their recommendations for measures to protect network-capable devices, please refer to this application note\u00a0\"Measures to protect network-capable devices with Ethernet connection\"\nPhoenix Contact published a\u00a0security advisory\nCERT@VDE published\u00a0VDE-2023-017\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
