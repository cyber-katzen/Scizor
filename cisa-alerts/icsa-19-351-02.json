EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 9\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n SPPA\\-T3000\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Improper Input Validation, Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Improper Authentication, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow or Wraparound, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, Improper Access Control, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, SFP Secondary Cluster: Missing Authentication, Information Exposure\n\n\n2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION\n----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-19\\-351\\-02 Siemens SPPA\\-T3000 that was published December 17, 2019, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, view and modify passwords, gain root privileges, access sensitive information, and read and write arbitrary files on the local system.\n \n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports the vulnerabilities affect the following SPPA\\-T3000 products:\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n* Application Server: all versions prior to Service Pack R8\\.2 SP2\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n* MS3000 Migration Server: All Versions\n\n\n### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n Note that an attacker must have network access to the Application Server, MS3000, or access to the Application Highway in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n#### 4\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n Specially crafted messages sent to the RPC service of the affected products could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition on the remote and local communication functionality of the affected products. A reboot of the system is required to recover the remote and local communication functionality.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2018\\-4832](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-4832) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Siemens recommends users upgrade SPPA\\-T3000 Application Server to SPPAT3000 Service Pack R8\\.2 SP2 to resolve vulnerabilities in the Application Server. Please contact a Siemens service management organization to obtain the update. For the Migration Server, Siemens recommends following the configuration recommendations for SPPAT3000 MS3000 in Siemens customer portal to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n* Implement mitigations described in the SPPA\\-T3000 security manual.\n* Restrict access to the Application Highway using the SPPA\\-T3000 Firewall.\n* External components should only be connected to the SPPA\\-T3000 DMZ; no bridging of external networks to either the Application or Automation highways is allowed.\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n* Perform regular updates of the SPPA\\-T3000 (e.g., by using the Security Server if available).\n* Implement mitigations provided in the customer information letter distributed via the customer service portal.\n* Please contact a Siemens representative if you need help at securing SPPA\\-T3000 installation.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (download:\n [https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n ) and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\n <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>\n\n\n\n\n For more information, please see\n [Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-451445](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-451445.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Monitor or block access to 80/TCP, 8090/TCP, 8095/TCP, 8080/TCP, 1099/TCP, 5010/TCP, 8888/TCP, and 7061/TCP.\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) \n .
