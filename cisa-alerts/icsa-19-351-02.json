MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens recommends users upgrade SPPA-T3000 Application Server to SPPAT3000 Service Pack R8.2 SP2 to resolve vulnerabilities in the Application Server. Please contact a Siemens service management organization to obtain the update. For the Migration Server, Siemens recommends following the configuration recommendations for SPPAT3000 MS3000 in Siemens customer portal to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n\nImplement mitigations described in the SPPA-T3000 security manual.\nRestrict access to the Application Highway using the SPPA-T3000 Firewall.\nExternal components should only be connected to the SPPA-T3000 DMZ; no bridging of external networks to either the Application or Automation highways is allowed.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nPerform regular updates of the SPPA-T3000 (e.g., by using the Security Server if available).\nImplement mitigations provided in the customer information letter distributed via the customer service portal.\nPlease contact a Siemens representative if you need help at securing SPPA-T3000 installation.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-451445.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMonitor or block access to 80/TCP, 8090/TCP, 8095/TCP, 8080/TCP, 1099/TCP, 5010/TCP, 8888/TCP, and 7061/TCP.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
