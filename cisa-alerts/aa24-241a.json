This includes organizations across several sectors in the U.S. (including in the education, finance, healthcare, and defense sectors as well as local government entities) and other countries (including in Israel, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates). The FBI assesses a significant percentage of these threat actors\u2019 operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and\u2014separate from the ransomware activity\u2014conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan).\nThis CSA provides the threat actor\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs), as well as highlights similar activity from a previous advisory (Iran-Based Threat Actor Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities) that the FBI and CISA published on Sept. 15, 2020. The information and guidance in this advisory are derived from FBI investigative activity and technical analysis of this group\u2019s intrusion activity against U.S. organizations and engagements with numerous entities impacted by this malicious activity.\nThe FBI recommends all organizations follow guidance provided in the Mitigations section of this advisory to defend against the Iranian cyber actors\u2019 activity.\nIf organizations believe they have been targeted or compromised by the Iranian cyber actors, the FBI and CISA recommend immediately contacting your local FBI field office for assistance and/or reporting the incident via CISA\u2019s Incident Reporting Form (see the Reporting\u00a0section of this advisory for more details and contact methods).\nFor more information on Iran state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA\u2019s Iran Cyber Threat webpage.\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n\nAA24-241A Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations\n(PDF,       582.01 KB\n  )\n\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\n\nAA24-241A STIX XML\n(XML,       29.02 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAA24-241A STIX JSON\n(JSON,       29.19 KB\n  )\n\n\nThreat Actor Details\nBackground on Threat Group and Prior Activity\nThis advisory outlines activity by a specific group of Iranian cyber actors that has conducted a high volume of computer network intrusion attempts against U.S. organizations since 2017 and as recently as August 2024. Compromised organizations include U.S.-based schools, municipal governments, financial institutions, and healthcare facilities. This group is known in the private sector by the names Pioneer Kitten, Fox Kitten, UNC757, Parisite, RUBIDIUM, and Lemon Sandstorm.[1][2] The actors also refer to themselves by the moniker Br0k3r, and as of 2024, they have been operating under the moniker \u201cxplfinder\u201d in their channels. FBI analysis and investigation indicate the group\u2019s activity is consistent with a cyber actor with Iranian state-sponsorship.\nThe FBI previously observed these actors attempt to monetize their access to victim organizations on cyber marketplaces. A significant percentage of the group\u2019s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. The actors offer full domain control privileges, as well as domain admin credentials, to numerous networks worldwide. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[3], Ransomhouse[4], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat) (#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat). The Iranian cyber actors\u2019 involvement in these ransomware attacks goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin.\nFurthermore, the FBI has historically observed this actor conduct hack-and-leak campaigns, such as the late 2020 campaign known as Pay2Key.[5],[6] The actors operated a .onion site (reachable through the Tor browser) hosted on cloud infrastructure registered to an organization previously compromised by the actors. (The actors created the server leveraging their prior access to this victim.)\u00a0Following the compromise and the subsequent unauthorized acquisition of victim data, the actors publicized news of their compromise (including on social media), tagging accounts of victim and media organizations, and leaking victim data on their .onion site. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments. Rather, the FBI assesses Pay2Key was an information operation aimed at undermining the security of Israel-based cyber infrastructure.\nAttribution Details\nFBI investigation identified that the Iranian cyber actors conduct malicious cyber activity, which FBI assessed to be in support of the GOI. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group\u2019s ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. defense sector networks, and those in Israel, Azerbaijan, United Arab Emirates. Instead, it is intended to steal sensitive information from these networks, suggesting the group maintains an association with the GOI. However, the group\u2019s ransomware activities are likely not sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency movement associated with their malicious activity.\nThe group uses the Iranian company name Danesh Novin Sahand (identification number 14007585836), likely as a cover IT entity for the group\u2019s malicious cyber activities.\nTechnical Details\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 15.1. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK\u2019s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA\u2019s Decider Tool.\nOverview of Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\nThe Iranian cyber actors\u2019 initial intrusions rely upon exploits of remote external services on internet-facing assets to gain initial access to victim networks. As of July 2024, these actors have been observed scanning IP addresses hosting Check Point Security Gateways, probing for devices potentially vulnerable to CVE-2024-24919. As of April 2024, these actors have conducted mass scanning of IP addresses hosting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS and GlobalProtect VPN devices. The actors were likely conducting reconnaissance and probing for devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-3400. Historically, this group has exploited organizations by leveraging CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519 related to Citrix Netscaler, and CVE-2022-1388 related to BIG-IP F5 devices.\nReconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, and Credential Access\nThe actors have been observed using the Shodan search engine to identify and enumerate IP addresses that host devices vulnerable to a particular CVE. The actors\u2019 initial access is usually obtained via exploiting a public-facing networking device, such as Citrix Netscaler (CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519), F5 BIG-IP (CVE-2022-1388), Pulse Secure/Ivanti VPNs (CVE-2024-21887), and, more recently, PanOS firewalls (CVE-2024-3400) [T1596][T1190].\nFollowing exploitation of vulnerable devices, the actors use the following techniques:\n\nCapture login credentials using webshells on compromised Netscaler devices and append to file named netscaler.1 in the same directory as the webshell [T1505.003][T1056].\nCreate the directory /var/vpn/themes/imgs/ on Citrix Netscaler devices to deploy a webshell [T1505.003]. Malicious files deployed to this directory include:\n\nnetscaler.1\nnetscaler.php\nctxHeaderLogon.php\n\n\nSpecifically related to Netscaler, place additional webshells on compromised devices immediately after system owners patch the exploited vulnerability [T1505.003]. The following file locations and filenames have been observed on devices:\n\n/netscaler/logon/LogonPoint/uiareas/ui_style.php\n/netscaler/logon/sanpdebug.php\u00a0\n\n\nCreate the directory /xui/common/images/ on targeted IP addresses [T1133].\nCreate accounts on victim networks; observed names include \u201csqladmin$,\u201d \u201cadfsservice,\u201d \u201cIIS_Admin,\u201d \u201ciis-admin,\u201d and \u201cJohn McCain\u201d [T1136.001].\nRequest exemptions to the zero-trust application and security policies for tools they intend to deploy on a victim network [T1098].\nCreate malicious scheduled task SpaceAgentTaskMgrSHR in Windows/Spaceport/ task folder. This task uses a DLL side-loading technique against the signed Microsoft SysInternals executable contig.exe, which may be renamed to dllhost.ext, to load a payload from version.dll. This file has been observed being executed from the Windows Downloads directory [T1053].\u00a0\nPlace a malicious backdoor version.dll in C:\\Windows\\ADFS\\ directory [T1505.003].\nUse a scheduled task to load malware through installed backdoors [T1053].\nDeployment of Meshcentral to connect with compromised servers for remote access [T1219].\nFor persistence and as detection and mitigation occurs, the actors create a daily Windows service task with random eight characters and attempt execution of a similarly named DLL contained in the C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\ directory. For example, a service named \u201ctest\u201d was observed attempting to load a file located at C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\test.sys [T1505].\n\nExecution, Privilege Escalation, and Defense Evasion\n\nRepurpose compromised credentials from exploiting networking devices, such as Citrix Netscaler, to log into other applications (i.e., Citrix XenDesktop) [T1078.003].\nRepurpose administrative credentials of network administrators to log into domain controllers and other infrastructure on victim networks [T1078.002].\nUse administrator credentials to disable antivirus and security software, and lower PowerShell policies to a less secure level [T1562.001][T1562.010].\nAttempt to enter security exemption tickets to the network security device or contractor to get the actor\u2019s tools allowlisted [T1562.001].\nUse a compromised administrator account to initiate a remote desktop session to another server on the network. In one instance, the FBI observed this technique being used to attempt to start Microsoft Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripted Environment (ISE) to run the command \u201cInvoke-WebRequest\u201d with a URI including files.catbox[.]moe. Catbox is a free, online file hosting site the actors use as a repository/hosting mechanism [T1059.001].\n\nDiscovery\n\nExport system registry hives and network firewall configurations on compromised servers [T1012].\nExfiltrate account usernames from the victim domain controller, as well as access configuration files and logs\u2014presumably to gather network and user account information for use in further exploitation efforts [T1482].\n\nCommand and Control\n\nInstall \u201cAnyDesk\u201d remote access program as a backup access method [T1219].\nEnable servers to use Windows PowerShell Web Access [T1059.001].\nUse the open source tunneling tool Ligolo (ligolo/ligolo-ng) [T1572].\nUse NGROK (ngrok[.]io) deployment to create outbound connections to a random subdomain [T1572].\n\nExfiltration and Impact\nAfter infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape, Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort victims [T1657]. The actors also conduct what is assessed to be separate set of malicious activity\u2014stealing sensitive data from victims [TA0010], likely in support of the GOI.\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\nSee Table 1 to Table 9 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.\n\n\nTable 1.

The authoring agencies recommend organizations investigate or vet these IP addresses prior to taking action, such as blocking.\nComment:\u00a0In addition to the infrastructure provided in the table below, the FBI and CISA warn that these actors are known to leverage information obtained through intrusions into cloud-computing resources associated with victim organizations. The actors have used this cloud infrastructure to conduct further cyber operations targeting other organizations. The FBI observed use of this tradecraft against U.S. academic and defense sectors, but it could theoretically be used against any organization. The FBI and CISA warn that if these actors compromised your organization, they may be leveraging your cloud services accounts to conduct malicious cyber activity and target other victims. The FBI has observed instances of the actors using compromised cloud service accounts to transmit data stolen from other compromised organizations.\n\n\nTable 10.

The FBI is providing this information to enable improved threat actor identification and tracking of malicious cyber activity. Please see Appendix A for list of TOX identifiers.\nThe FBI observed the threat actors to be associated with the following bitcoin address values:\n\nbc1q8n7jjgdepuym825zwwftr3qpem3tnjx3m50ku0\nbc1qlwd94gf5uhdpu4gynk6znc5j3rwk9s53c0dhjs\nbc1q2egjjzmchtm3q3h3een37zsvpph86hwgq4xskh\nbc1qjzw7sh3pd5msgehdaurzv04pm40hm9ajpwjqky\nbc1qn5tla384qxpl6zt7kd068hvl7y4a6rt684ufqp\nbc1ql837eewad47zn0uzzjfgqjhsnf2yhkyxvxyjjc\nbc1qy8pnttrfmyu4l3qcy59gmllzqq66gmr446ppcr\nbc1q6620fmev7cvkfu82z43vwjtec6mzgcp5hjrdne\nbc1qr6h2zcxlntpcjystxdf7qy2755p25yrwucm4lq\nbc1qx9tteqhama2x2w9vwqsyny6hldh8my8udx5jlm\nbc1qz75atxj4dvgezyuspw8yz9khtkuk5jpdgfauq8\nbc1q6w2an66vrje747scecrgzucw9ksha66x9zt980\nbc1qsn4l6h3mhyhmr72vw4ajxf2gr74hwpalks2tp9\nbc1qtjhvqkun4uxtr4qmq6s3f7j49nr4sp0wywp489\n\nMitigations\nThe FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the mitigations listed below to improve their cybersecurity posture based on the Iranian cyber group\u2019s activity. The FBI judges the group\u2019s targeting is primarily based on the identification of devices vulnerable to CVEs named in this notification (see Technical Details section for a list of CVEs). As such, any U.S. organization deploying software with these vulnerabilities may be targeted for further exploitation and should follow this guidance to defend against exploitation by this group.\nThese mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\u00a0Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\nThe FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations:\n\nReview available logs for IP addresses in Table 10 for indications of traffic with your organization\u2019s network in the provided timeframes [CPG 3.A]. The indicators in Table 11 should also be reviewed to identify historical activity or incidents which may have previously been identified by your organization.\nApply patches and/or mitigations for CVE-2024-3400, CVE-2022-1388, CVE-2019-19781, and CVE-2023-3519 [CPG 1.E].\n\nBe advised, patching for the above referenced CVEs may be insufficient to mitigate malicious activity if your network has already been compromised by these actors while the network device was vulnerable. Additional investigation into the use of stolen credentials (e.g., via the webshell on Netscaler devices) is strongly encouraged to identify threat actor attempts to establish footholds on other parts of the network [CPG 3.A].\n\n\nCheck your systems for the unique identifiers and TTPs used by the actors when operating on compromised networks, including creation of specific usernames, use of NGROK and Ligolo, and deployment of webshells in specific directories [CPG 3.A].\nCheck your systems for outbound web requests to files.catbox[.]moe and ***.ngrok[.]io [CPG 3.A].\n\nValidate Security Controls\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.\nTo get started:\n\nSelect an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 2 to Table 10).\nAlign your security technologies against the technique.\nTest your technologies against the technique.\nAnalyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\nRepeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\nTune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\nReferences\n\nFox Kitten, UNC757, Parisite, Pioneer Kitten, RUBIDIUM, Lemon Sandstorm, Group G0117 | MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae\u00a0\nPIONEER KITTEN: Targets & Methods [Adversary Profile] (crowdstrike.com)\nNoEscape - SentinelOne\nRansomHouse - SentinelOne\nPay2Key, Software S0556 | MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae\nPay2Key Ransomware Alert - Check Point Research\n\nReporting\nYour organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to the FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to the FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws.\nRansomware Incidents\nThe FBI and CISA are interested in any information that can be shared in the case of a ransomware incident, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\nAdditional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators.\nThe FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), your local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency\u2019s Incident Reporting Form or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov), or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).\nOther Incidents\nU.S. organizations are encouraged to report suspicious or criminal activity related to information in this advisory to the FBI\u2019s Internet IC3 or your local FBI Field Office. Report suspicious or malicious cyber activity to CISA via the agency\u2019s Incident Reporting Form or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).
