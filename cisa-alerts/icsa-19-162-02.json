EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC Ident\u00a0MV440 Familiy\nVulnerabilities: Improper Privilege Management, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-162-02 Siemens SIMATIC Ident\u00a0MV440 Family that was published June 11, 2019, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\u00a0\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to escalate privileges and view data transmitted between the device and the user.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SIMATIC Ident families are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC MV440 family: All versions prior to v7.0.6\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nAn authenticated attacker could escalate privileges by sending specially crafted requests to the integrated webserver.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-10925 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nCommunication with the device is not encrypted. Data transmitted between the device and the user can be obtained by an attacker in a privileged network position.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-10926 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens PSIRT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has released an update for the SIMATIC MV400 family and recommends updating to the latest version (v7.0.6).\u00a0\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nBy setting the DISA bit, changes to the project by logged-in users can be prevented. Please refer to the operating instructions for more details.\nProtect network access to affected devices.\n\nFor more information see Siemens security advisory SSA-816980\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
