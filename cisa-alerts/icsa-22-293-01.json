[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryBentley Systems MicroStation Connect==================================== Last Revised October 20, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-293\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Bentley Systems* **Equipment:**  MicroStation Connect* **Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may crash the device being accessed or allow remote arbitrary code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Bentley Systems MicroStation Connect, a software management platform, are affected: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0v10\\.17\\.0\\.209 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### **3\\.2\\.1 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to a stack\\-based buffer overflow when a malformed design (DGN) file is parsed. This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2022\\-40201](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40201)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to an out\\-of\\-bounds read when parsing DGN files, which may allow an attacker to crash the product, disclose sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2022\\-41613](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41613)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Bentley Systems has implemented multiple validation checks within the DGN platform when processing malformed DGNs. Bentley Systems recommends users update to the latest version of the MicroStation Connect:* MicroStation Connect Update 17\\.1 For more information and MicroStation updates, contact [Bentley Support](https://www.bentley.com/support/)  . CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
