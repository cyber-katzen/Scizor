By manipulating the first byte within a URL, the server switches to a special interpretation of the URL. This allows an attacker to read the application process memory and perform a DoS attack by specifying invalid memory locations.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2011\\-4879](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4879) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. Siemens\u2019 assessment of the vulnerabilities using the CVSS Version 2\\.0 calculator rates a CVSS Base Score of 8\\.5\\.\n \n\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\n\n#### Exploitability\n\n\n\n An attacker would need user interaction to exploit vulnerability \\#5\\.\n \n\n\n\n The remaining vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\n#### Existence of Exploit\n\n\n\n Publicly available exploits are known to specifically target vulnerabilities \\#1, \\#2, and \\#7 through \\#11\\.\n \n\n\n\n No known publicly available exploits specifically target vulnerabilities \\#3 through \\#6\\.\n \n\n\n#### Difficulty\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities would be very simple for a skilled attacker to exploit.\n \n\n\n\n Exploiting vulnerability \\#5 requires social engineering to convince the user to accept and load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n \n\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\n\n\n Each of the reported vulnerabilities has been addressed by Siemens, as follows:\n \n\n\n* Insecure authentication token generation (\\#1\\), cross\\-site scripting (\\#3\\), header injection vulnerability (\\#4\\), HMI web server directory traversal (\\#10\\), and arbitrary memory read access vulnerabilities (\\#11\\).\n\t+ Patches are included in Siemens\u2019 WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1, http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/58112582 website last accessed April 16, 2012\\. cc. WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1, http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/58112587 website last accessed April 16, 2012\\.and WinCC flexible 2008 SP3\\.WinCC flexible 2008 SP3,http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/57267466 website last accessed April 16, 2012\\.\n* Weak default passwords (\\#2\\).\n\t+ Product documentation contained in WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1, and WinCC flexible 2008 SP3 has been updated to tell the user how to set a proper password during initial setup.\n* Client\\-side attack via specially crafted files (\\#5\\), runtime loader string stack overflow (\\#7\\), runtime loader directory traversal (\\#8\\), runtime loader DoS (\\#9\\).\n\t+ Siemens recommends that users deactivate the transfer mode after device configuration, because the transport mode provides full access to the device.ee The transport mode was implemented under the assumption that the software would be running in a protected industrial environment. Siemens strongly recommends that users protect systems according to recommended security practicesSiemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, v1\\.1, http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial\\-security/Documents/industrial\\_security\\_operational\\_guidelines\\_en.pdf website last accessed April 16, 2012\\.Siemens Industrial Security homepage, http://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity website last accessed April 16, 2012\\. and configure the environment according to the operational guidelines.\n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n* Lack of telnet daemon authentication (\\#6\\).\n\t+ Because telnet is a clear text protocol, customers are advised to be aware of corresponding risks. The telnet daemon is disabled by default in product versions WinCC flexible 2008 SP3 and newer, as well as WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 and newer. Siemens recommends disabling the telnet function on SIMATIC panels when telnet is not actively being used.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT tested WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1hh,WinCC V11 (TIA Portal) SP2 Update 1, http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/58112587 website last accessed April 16, 2012\\. and WinCC flexible 2008 SP3WinCC flexible 2008 SP3, http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/57267466 website last accessed April 16, 2012\\.\n \n\n\n* Insecure authentication token generation (\\#1\\) and found that it successfully resolves the following vulnerabilities:\n* Cross\\-site scripting (\\#3\\)\n* Header injection vulnerability (\\#4\\)\n* HMI web server directory traversal (\\#10\\)\n* Arbitrary memory read access vulnerabilities (\\#11\\).\n\n\n\n The remaining vulnerabilities are addressed in documentation and a new\n [FAQ](http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/29054992) \n entry on Siemens website. If unable to implement these changes, product users should contact their integrator or Siemens product support for assistance.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides\n [a section for control systems security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n1.
