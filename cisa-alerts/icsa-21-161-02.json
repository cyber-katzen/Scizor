EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: AGG Software\nEquipment: Web Server\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution and exposure of arbitrary system files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Web Server may be bundled with any Data Logger:\n\nv4.0.40.1014 and prior (webserver.dll)\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, which may allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system.\nCVE-2021-32964 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-32962 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAGG recommends Web Server plugin users to update to 4.0.42 Build 512 or later. This plugin may be bundled with any of AGG data loggers.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of\u00a0 these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
