[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryMeinberg Radio Clocks LANTIME M\\-Series XSS=========================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-275\\-01OVERVIEW-------- This advisory was originally posted to the US\\-CERT secure Portal library on October 2, 2014, and is being released to the ICS\\-CERT web site. Martem Telecontrol Systems security researcher Aivar Liimets has identified a reflected cross\u2011site scripting vulnerability in the Meinberg Radio Clocks GmbH \\& Co. KG LANTIME M400 web interface. Meinberg has produced a firmware update that mitigates this vulnerability in all LANTIME M\\-Series. Aivar Liimets has tested the firmware update to validate that it resolves the vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Meinberg Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server firmware versions are affected:* LANTIME M\\-Series models: V6\\.15\\.019 and prior.IMPACT------ The reflected cross\\-site scripting vulnerability could cause the time server to provide misinformation to devices. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Meinberg Radio Clocks GmbH \\& Co. KG is an international provider of electronic modules, based in Bad Pyrmont, Germany. The affected products, the LANTIME M\\-Series, are NTP Servers. According to Meinberg, the Meinberg NTP Servers are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Communications, Energy, Financial Services, and Transportation Systems. Meinberg estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE\\-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross\\-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79\\.html, web site last accessed October 30, 2014\\.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [www.ics\\-cert.org](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
