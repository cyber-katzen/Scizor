RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain remote code execution on the server with SYSTEM privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products and versions are affected:\n\nDesigo CC: Versions 3.x and 4.x, and\nDesigo CC Compact: Versions 3.x and 4.x\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nAffected applications are delivered with a third-party component that contains a remote code execution vulnerability if the advanced reporting engine is enabled.\nCVE-2020-10055 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens ProductCERT reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released patches for the affected products and recommends specific countermeasures for unpatched systems:\n\nUsers of Version 4.x, apply the latest patch (Login required).\nUsers of Version 3.x, apply the latest patch (Login required).\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nIf the advanced reporting extension module is already installed, apply the patch provided through Siemens online for the affected product and version.\nIn all other cases avoid the installation of the extension module from existing deliveries of Desigo CC or Desigo CC Compact software, until you receive an updated version of the software that already includes the patch.\n\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-786743\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
