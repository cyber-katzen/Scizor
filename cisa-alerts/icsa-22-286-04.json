EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC S7\\-1200 and S7\\-1500 CPU families* **Vulnerability:**  Insufficiently Protected Credentials2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could expose confidential configuration data.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports this vulnerability affects the SIMATIC S7\\-1200 and S7\\-1500 CPU product families:* SIMATIC Drive Controller family: All versions prior to 2\\.9\\.2* SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (including SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to 21\\.9* SIMATIC ET 200SP Open controller CPU 1515SP PC (including SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC S7\\-1200 CPU family (including SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to V4\\.5\\.0* SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU family (including related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to 2\\.9\\.2* SIMATIC S7\\-1500 Software Controller: All version prior to 21\\.9* SIMCATIC S7\\-PLCSIM Advanced: All version prior to 4\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-522](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html) Affected Siemens SIMATIC S7\\-1200 and S7\\-1500 CPU Families protect the built\\-in global private key with insufficient key protection. This could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an offline attack against a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract confidential configuration data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy PG/PC and human machine interface (HMI) communication.[CVE\\-2022\\-38465](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-38465)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Tal Keren from Claroty reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:* For SIMATIC Drive Controller family: Update to [version 2\\.9\\.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773914/)  or later, migrate project in TIA Portal to the updated version and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication\u201d.* For SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (including SIPLUS variants): Update to [version 21\\.9](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109759122/)  or later and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication\u201d.* For SIMATIC ET 200SP Open controller CPU 1515SP PC (including SIPLUS variants): Currently no fix is planned.* For SIMATIC S7\\-1200 CPU family (including SIPLUS variants): Update to [version 4\\.5\\.0](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793280/)  or later and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication\u201d.* For SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU family (including related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): Update to [version 2\\.9\\.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478459/)  or later and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication\u201d.* For SIMATIC S7\\-1500 Software Controller: Update to [version 21\\.9](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478528/)  or later version and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication\u201d.* For SIMCATIC S7\\-PLCSIM Advanced: Update to [version 4\\.0](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109795016/)  or later and redeploy within the project, configure the CPU to \u201cOnly allow PG/PC and HMI communication Siemens has identified additional workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Only use legacy, not TLS\\-based, PG/PC and HMI communication in trusted network environments.* Protect access to the TIA Portal project and CPU, including related memory cards, from unauthorized persons. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
