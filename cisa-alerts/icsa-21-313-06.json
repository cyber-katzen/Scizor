RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote authenticated attacker access to sensitive information or deliver false information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PI Web API, a data management platform, are affected:\n\nAll versions of PI Web API 2019 SPI and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA remote authenticated attacker with write access to a PI Server could trick a user into interacting with a PI Web API endpoint and redirect them to a malicious website. As a result, a victim may disclose sensitive information to the attacker or be provided with false information.\nCVE-2021-43549\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nOSIsoft reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOSIsoft recommends upgrading to PI Web API 2021. Additional information can be found in the OSIsoft PI Web API security bulletin\u00a0(registration required).\nOSIsoft recommends applying the following workaround in PI Web API to help reduce the risk:\nRemove the OSIsoft.REST.Documentation.dll from the PI Web API installation directory.\n\nThe PI Web API installation directory is available at this registry entry:\n\n\\\\HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\PISystem\\WebAPI\\InstallationDirectory\n\n\nThe default PI Web API installation directory is:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\PIPC\\WebAPI\nRemoving this file will cause built-in documentation to no longer be available. Navigating to the PI Web API endpoint with a browser will result in an error; however, the PI Web API will continue to function as a REST API\n\n\nDocumentation can be found at the OSIsoft website. Alternately, users are encouraged to limit access to PI Web API built-in documentation to dedicated development environments\n\nOSIsoft recommends users employ the following defense measures to lower the impact of exploitation for PI Web API:\n\nAvoid adding authentication type \u201cAnonymous\u201d in PI Web API configuration settings to limit exposure to authenticated users only,\nConsider using a web application firewall to block html responses from PI Web API servers,\nAudit the AF hierarchy to ensure there are no unauthorized databases, elements, or attributes,\nFor Kerberos authentication configurations, use Group Policy to deny network authentication to PI Server Administrator accounts on the PI Web API server.\n\nSee the OSIsoft customer portal knowledge article for additional details and associated security updates (registration required).\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
