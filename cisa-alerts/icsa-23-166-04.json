This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to extract confidential TO configuration from the device.[CVE\\-2023\\-27465](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27465)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.6 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Update to [V5\\.5 SP1 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109812773/)  if possible.* Restrict physical access to the device and avoid using Security Level Low (e.g., Service Selector Switch) in position 8, with simotion.ini or the PSTATE program \\- see Section 3\\.5 of SIMOTION IT \\- SIMOTION IT Diagnostics and Configuration Manual) in production environments.
