For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u202fSiemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\u00a0\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 4.6\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMOTION\nVulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to extract confidential technology object (TO) configuration from the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products from Siemens are affected:\n\nSIMOTION C240 (6AU1240-1AA00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION C240 PN (6AU1240-1AB00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D410-2 DP (6AU1410-2AA00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D410-2 DP/PN (6AU1410-2AD00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D425-2 DP (6AU1425-2AA00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D425-2 DP/PN (6AU1425-2AD00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D435-2 DP (6AU1435-2AA00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D435-2 DP/PN (6AU1435-2AD00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D445-2 DP/PN (6AU1445-2AD00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later\nSIMOTION D445-2 DP/PN (6AU1445-2AD00-0AA1): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION D455-2 DP/PN (6AU1455-2AD00-0AA0): All versions including V5.4 and later but prior to V5.5 SP1\nSIMOTION P320-4 E (6AU1320-4DE65-3AF0): All versions including V5.4 and later\nSIMOTION P320-4 S (6AU1320-4DS66-3AG0): All versions including V5.4 and later\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION DUE TO INCOMPATIBLE POLICIES CWE-213\nWhen operated with Security Level Low the device does not protect access to certain services relevant for debugging. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to extract confidential TO configuration from the device.\nCVE-2023-27465 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nUpdate to V5.5 SP1 or later if possible.\nRestrict physical access to the device and avoid using Security Level Low (e.g., Service Selector Switch) in position 8, with simotion.ini or the PSTATE program - see Section 3.5 of SIMOTION IT - SIMOTION IT Diagnostics and Configuration Manual) in production environments.\n\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-482956 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
