EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  SMA Solar Technology AG* **Equipment:**  Sunny WebBox* **Vulnerability:**  Cross\\-Site Request Forgery2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to generate a denial\\-of\\-service condition, modify passwords, enable services, achieve man\\-in\\-the\\-middle, and modify input parameters associated with devices such as sensors.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following version of Sunny WebBox is affected:* Firmware Version 1\\.6 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [CROSS\\-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE\\-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) An attacker could send a malicious link to an authenticated operator, which may allow remote attackers to perform actions with the permissions of the user. This device uses IP addresses to maintain communication after a successful login, which would increase the ease of exploitation.[CVE\\-2019\\-13529](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13529)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Borja Merino and Eduardo Villaverde of the Technical Inspection Laboratory of the Mining School (University of Le\u00f3n), through Adenda 2, coordinated this vulnerability with Carlos del Canto and Victor Fidalgo of INCIBE\\-CERT\u2019s Industrial Cybersecurity Team.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- This product is end\\-of\\-life and is no longer supported. SMA recommends deactivation of port forwarding as it is not required for monitoring PV systems via the SMA Sunny Portal. If direct access to a system from the Internet is necessary, SMA recommends using an encrypted virtual private network (VPN). On delivery, any saved default passwords should also be replaced with individual secure passwords, and unused ports on the system/router should be closed. SMA installers and administrators can answer specific questions about individual configuration of SMA devices.
