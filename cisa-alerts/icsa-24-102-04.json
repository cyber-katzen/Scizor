A client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP) implemented by these extensions mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.[CVE\\-2023\\-48795](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-48795)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* (CVE\\-2023\\-6789, CVE\\-2023\\-6793, CVE\\-2023\\-38802, CVE\\-2024\\-0008\\) RUGGEDCOM APE1808: Contact customer support to receive patch and update information.* (CVE\\-2023\\-48795\\) RUGGEDCOM APE1808: Currently no fix is available* (CVE\\-2023\\-48795\\) RUGGEDCOM APE1808: CVE\\-2023\\-48795: Customers can resolve this issue by configuring the in\\-use SSH profile to contain at least one cipher and at least one MAC algorithm, which removes support for CHACHA20\\-POLY1305 and all Encrypt\\-then\\-MAC algorithms available (ciphers with \\-etm in the name) in PAN\\-OS software. See Palo Alto Networks' upstream documentation [https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE\\-2023\\-48795](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2023-48795)  for additional guidance. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-455250 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-455250.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-455250.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
