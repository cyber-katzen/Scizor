Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Treasury (Treasury) to highlight the cyber threat to cryptocurrency posed by North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and provide mitigation recommendations. Working with U.S. government partners, FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess that Lazarus Group\u2014which these agencies attribute to North Korean state\\-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors\u2014is targeting individuals and companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that have been modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency.       This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21\\-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of\u00a0North Korea's Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us\\-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21\\-048A.       There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018\\. In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third\\-party application from a website that appears legitimate.       The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version\u2014JMT Trading\u2014and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations.       JMT Trading malware, discovered by a cybersecurity company in October 2019, is a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading software that is marketed and distributed by a company and website\u2014JMT Trading and jmttrading\\[.]org, respectively\u2014that appear legitimate.

ADVObfuscation is described as using C\\+\\+ 11/14 language to generate, at compile time, obfuscated code without using any external tool and without modifying the compiler and introduces some form of randomness to generate polymorphic code like the encryption of strings literals and the obfuscation of calls using finite state machines.

The OSX program has very similar functionality to the Windows program, but does not have a digital signature. Again, the installer appears to be legitimate and installs both JMTTrader in the \u201c/Applications/JMTTrader.app/Contents/MacOS/\u201d folder and a hidden program named \u201c.CrashReporter\u201d in the \u201c/Applications/JMTTrader.app/Contents/Resources/\u201d folder. The installer contains a postinstall script (see Figure 5\\).       This postinstall script has similar functionality to the postinstall script of the first version but has a few additional features. It still moves the hidden plist file (.com.jmttrading.plist) to the LaunchDaemons folder, but also changes the file permissions on the plist. Once in the LaunchDaemons folder, this program will be ran on system load as root for every user, which will launch the CrashReporter program with the Maintain parameter.       The postinstall script also moves the \u201c.CrashReporter\u201d program to a new location \u201c/Library/JMTTrader/CrashReporter\u201d and makes it executable. Like CelasTradePro, as the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script then launches the CrashReporter program with the Maintain parameter and runs it in the background (\\&).       The package also has \u201cDeveloped by Gary Mendez. JMTTrading Group\u201d in the Info.plist properties file.

This lack of obfuscation makes it easier to determine the program\u2019s functionality in detail.       Upon launch, the malware checks for the \u201cMaintain\u201d parameter, and will exit if the parameter is not found, likely to avoid sandbox analysis.       CrashReporter then creates a randomly generated token (identifier) and collects the binary\u2019s version and process ID to send to the server. This data is XOR encrypted with the hard\\-coded key \u201cX,%\\`PMk\\-\\-Jj8s\\+6\\=\\\\x02\u201d (last value is a non\\-printable ASCII character which is hexadecimal \\\\x02\\). While the key is different than the XOR key for the Windows sample, the first 16 bytes are the same.       The encrypted data is sent to the same C2 server as the Windows sample at hxxps\\[:]//beastgoc.com/grepmonux.php with the multipart data form separator \u201cjGzAcN6k4VsTRn9\u201d. CrashReporter also has a hard\\-coded user\\-agent string: \u201cMozilla/5\\.0 (Windows NT 10\\.0; Win64; x64\\) AppleWebKit/537\\.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72\\.0\\.3626\\.121 Safari/537\\.36\u201d along with other hard\\-coded values sent with the data including \u201ctoken,\" \u201cquery,\" and \u201cmont.jpg.\"       If CrashReporter receives a response with the HTTP code 200 (successful), it will invoke another function which will wait for tasking from the C2 server. When a tasking is received, the function decrypts the data with the same hardcoded XOR key and processes the tasking. Accepted tasking commands include the following:       \\-\\-Begin accepted tasking commands\\-\\-     \u201cexit\u201d: this command will cause CrashReporter to gracefully exit     \u201cup\u201d: this command will upload a file from the C2 server to the infected host     \u201cstand \u201d: this command will execute commands from the server via the shell using the popen API (the \"popen()\" function opens a process by creating a bidirectional pipe, forking, and invoking the shell)     \\-\\-End accepted tasking commands\\-\\-       These possible commands from the C2 server gives the remote attacker full control over the OSX system. It is likely that the functionality of the Windows CrashReporter.exe is the same as this OSX malware, as the original AppleJeus had the same functionality on both operating systems.

Then on October 13, 2019, a different cyber security organization published an article detailing the OSX JMTTrader, and soon after the C2 \"beastgoc.com\" went offline. There is not a confirmed sample of the payload to analyze at this point.      Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
