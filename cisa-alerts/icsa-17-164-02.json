There is more detail in the \u201cSecurity Information and Guidance\u201d section of the release notes on the OSIsoft web page (user account required):[https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Downloads/File/bd5c24f2\\-4937\\-45e6\\-aaa5\\-939d6208f5fc](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Downloads/File/bd5c24f2-4937-45e6-aaa5-939d6208f5fc)  OSIsoft recommends users run the PI Data Archive on a secured internal control or corporate network. For a starting point on PI System security best practices, see Knowledge Base Article KB00833 \\- Seven best practices for securing your PI Server on the OSIsoft web page:<https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00833> Please see Security Bulletin AL00315 on the OSIsoft web page for more information about this issue:<https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00315> NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PI Data Archive has protocol flaws with the potential to expose change records in the clear and allow a malicious party to spoof a server within a collective.[CVE\\-2017\\-7930](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-7930)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
