EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  RTU500 Series* **Vulnerabilities:**  Type Confusion, Reachable Assertion2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition in the affected version of the RTU500 series product.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of RTU500 Series, a remote terminal unit, are affected:* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.4\\.X* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.6\\.X* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 12\\.7\\.X* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 13\\.0\\.X* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 13\\.1\\.X* RTU500 Series CMU Firmware Version 13\\.2\\.1### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE\\-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html) A vulnerability exists in the affected OpenLDAP versions leading to an LDAP service crash in the parsing of a keystring, resulting in a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2020\\-36229](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-36229)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE\\-617](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/617.html) A vulnerability exists in the affected OpenLDAP versions leading in an assertion failure in an LDAP service in the parsing of a file, resulting in a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2020\\-36230](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-36230)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends users update to the following versions:* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 12\\.4\\.X to Version 12\\.4\\.11 (to be released by end of January 2022\\)* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 12\\.6\\.X to Version 12\\.6\\.7* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 12\\.7\\.X to Version 12\\.7\\.2* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 13\\.0\\.X to Version 13\\.2\\.3* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 13\\.1\\.X to Version 13\\.2\\.3* RTU500 series CMU Firmware Versions 13\\.2\\.X to Version 13\\.2\\.3 As the vulnerabilities affect only the RTU500 series in which CAM function is configured and enabled, a possible mitigation is to disable the CAM function if it is not used. The CAM function is disabled by default. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Do not directly connect to the Internet.* Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Please see Hitachi Energy advisory [8DBD000066](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000066&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  for further mitigation and update information. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
