[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAdvantech WebAccess (Update A)============================== Last Revised January 11, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-004\\-02A### **CVSS v3 8\\.2****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Advantech**Equipment:**  WebAccess**Vulnerabilities:**  Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Path Traversal, SQL Injection, Improper Input Validation.UPDATE INFORMATION------------------ This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-18\\-004\\-02 Advantech WebAccess that was published January 4, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Advantech reports the vulnerabilities affect the following WebAccess products:* WebAccess versions prior to 8\\.3IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause the device to crash. An attacker may be able to further exploit this condition to remotely execute arbitrary code or bypass authentication.MITIGATION---------- Advantech has released WebAccess Version 8\\.3 to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccess at the following location (registration required):[http://www.advantech.com/industrial\\-automation/webaccess/download](http://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess/download)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-822](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/822.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There are multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to cause the program to use an invalid memory address, resulting in a program crash.[CVE\\-2017\\-16728](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-16728)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
