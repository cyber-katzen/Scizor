An attacker may be able to further exploit this condition to remotely execute arbitrary code or bypass authentication.\nMITIGATION\nAdvantech has released WebAccess Version 8.3 to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccess at the following location (registration required):\nhttp://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess/download\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\n\nThere are multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to cause the program to use an invalid memory address, resulting in a program crash.\nCVE-2017-16728 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\nThere are multiple instances of a vulnerability that allows too much data to be written to a location on the stack.\nCVE-2017-16724 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\n\nAn attacker has access to files within the directory structure of the target device.\nCVE-2017-16720 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\n\nWebAccess does not properly sanitize its inputs for SQL commands.\nCVE-2017-16716 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\n\nWebAccess allows some inputs that may cause the program to crash.\nCVE-2017-16753 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\n\nUNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\n\nWebAccess allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files.\nCVE-2017-16736 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n\nUSE AFTER FREE CWE-416\n\nWebAccess allows an unauthenticated attacker to specify an arbitrary address.\nCVE-2017-16732 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nRESEARCHER\nSteven Seeley of Offensive Security, Zhou Yu, rgod working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, and Michael DePlante of Leahy Center for Digital Investigation at Champlain College reported these vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: East Asia, United States, Europe\nCompany Headquarters Location: Taiwan\n",
