EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Xpedition Designer* **Vulnerability:**  Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports this vulnerability affects the following PCB design flow products:* Xpedition Designer: All versions prior to vX.2\\.11### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE\\-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html) The affected application assigns improper access rights to the service executable. This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.[CVE\\-2022\\-31465](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31465)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released [update vX.2\\.11](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/852852130/download/202201059/)  for the Xpedition Designer and recommends updating to the latest version. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Harden the application server to prevent local access by untrusted personnel.* Remove write permissions for every non\\-administrative user on files and folders located under the installation path. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals.
