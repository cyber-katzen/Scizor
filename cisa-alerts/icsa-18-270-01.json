EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 10\\.0*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Emerson* **Equipment:**  AMS Device Manager* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Access Control, Improper Privilege Management2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary remote code execution and malware injection.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of AMS Device Manager, an Asset Management System, are affected:* AMS Device Manager: v12\\.0 to v13\\.5### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) A specially crafted script may be run that allows arbitrary remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-14804](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-14804)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  .### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE\\-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html) Non\\-administrative users are able to change executable and library files on the affected products.[CVE\\-2018\\-14808](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-14808)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  .### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sergey Temnikov of Kaspersky Lab and Emerson discovered and reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Emerson recommends users patch the affected products listed below: AMS Device Manager: v12\\.0 to v13\\.5 \u00a0Software patches are available to users with access to the Guardian Support Portal at:<https://guardian.emersonprocess.com/> . Please refer to the Knowledge Base Articles for AMS NK\\-1700\\-0324, NK\\-1700\\-0252 and DeltaV NK\\-1800\\-0880 (DSN 18006\\) for more information. Vulnerability [CVE\\-2018\\-14808](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-14808)  cannot be exploited if application whitelisting is implemented since it would prevent files from being overwritten. To limit exposure to these and other vulnerabilities, Emerson recommends deploying and configuring AMS Device Manager as described in the AMS Device Manager Installation Guide which is available in Emerson\u2019s Guardian Support Portal. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
