This can be found at the following link:\nhttps://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID=15\nRockwell Automation has provided interim compensating controls for the remaining Allen-Bradley Stratix and ArmorStratix switches to help reduce the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Rockwell Automation encourages users to evaluate the compensating controls provided below and apply the possible mitigations.\n\nDisable the following Management Information Bases (MIBs) on a device, if they are installed/active on the Stratix device:\n\n\nStratix 8000, 8300, 5700, 5400, 5410\n\nCISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB\n\n\nStratix 5900\n\nADSL-LINE-MIB\nCISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB\nCISCO-BSTUN-MIB\nCISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB\nCISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB\n\n\n\nDetails on how to use the Command Line Interface to disable or limit access to SNMP or individual MIBs can be found at Knowledgebase Article ID 1055391. A login is required to view the article.\nNote: The Stratix device may not have all of the MIBs installed/active.\n\nIf SNMP is required, use strong SNMP v3 credentials since this attack requires authentication.\nCisco Talos, Cisco\u2019s threat intelligence organization, has created the following Snort rules (SIDs): 43424, 43425, 43426, 43427, 43428, 43429, 43430, 43431, 43432 to detect exploits utilizing this vulnerability, which can be used on Stratix 5950 Security Appliances positioned appropriately within the network architecture to provide enhanced visibility. The Snort rules (SIDs) are enabled following curated rule sets \u2013 \u201cBalanced Security and Connectivity\u201d, \u201cConnectivity over Security,\u201d and \u201cSecure over Connectivity.\u201d\nUse proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that SNMP requests from unauthorized sources are blocked. Firewalls will not block requests from compromised but authorized sources.\n\nAs new versions of firmware are released to remediate this vulnerability, Rockwell Automation will provide mitigation updates in their advisory. For more information about these vulnerabilities, mitigation updates, and Rockwell Automation\u2019s general security guidelines, please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory found at the following link. A login is required to view the advisory.\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1055133\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSNMP REMOTE CODE EXECUTION VULNERABILITIES CWE-119\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. has identified multiple SNMP remote code execution vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software affecting version of Allen-Bradley Stratix and ArmorStratix. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP v2c or earlier, attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities in SNMP v3, an attacker must authenticate with user credentials. If exploited, this could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Stratix and ArmorStratix system.\nCVE-2017-6736, CVE-2017-6737, CVE-2017-6738, CVE-2017-6739, CVE-2017-6740, CVE-2017-6741, CVE-2017-6742, CVE-2017-6743 and CVE-2017-6744 have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nCisco discovered these vulnerabilities during internal testing. Rockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n",
