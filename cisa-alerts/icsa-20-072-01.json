RISK EVALUATION------------------- In the most severe case, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take over a user\u2019s browser session, discover session\\-based information, or affect the confidentiality of sensitive information within the application.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of eSOMS are affected:* eSOMS 6\\.02 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF WEB BROWSER CACHE CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-525](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/525.html) For ABB eSOMS 6\\.0\\.3 and earlier, The Cache\\-Control and Pragma HTTP header(s) have not been properly configured within the application response. This can potentially allow browsers and proxies to cache sensitive information.[CVE\\-2019\\-19000](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19000)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE\\-1021](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1021.html) For ABB eSOMS Versions 6\\.0\\.2 and earlier, the X\\-Frame\\-Options header is not configured in HTTP response. This can potentially allow 'ClickJacking' attacks where an attacker can frame parts of the application on a malicious website, revealing sensitive user information such as authentication credentials.[CVE\\-2019\\-19001](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19001)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF HTTP HEADERS FOR SCRIPTING SYNTAX CWE\\-644](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/644.html) For ABB eSOMS Versions 6\\.0\\.2 and earlier, the X\\-XSS\\-Protection HTTP response header is not set in responses from the web server. For older web browser not supporting Content Security Policy, this might increase the risk of cross\\-site scripting.[CVE\\-2019\\-19002](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19002)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [SENSITIVE COOKIE WITHOUT 'HTTPONLY' FLAG CWE\\-1004](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1004.html) For ABB eSOMS Versions 6\\.0\\.2 and earlier, the HTTPOnly flag is not set. This can allow JavaScript to access the cookie contents, which in turn might enable Cross\\-site Scripting.[CVE\\-2019\\-19003](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19003)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.5 [PROTECTION MECHANISM FAILURE CWE\\-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html) For ABB eSOMS Versions 6\\.0\\.3 and earlier, the X\\-Content\\-Type\\-Options Header is missing in the HTTP response, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as different content type other than declared. A possible attack scenario would be unauthorized code execution via text interpreted as JavaScript.[CVE\\-2019\\-19089](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19089)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.6 [SENSITIVE COOKIE IN HTTPS SESSION WITHOUT 'SECURE' ATTRIBUTE CWE\\-614](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html) For ABB eSOMS Versions 6\\.0\\.2 and earlier, the Secure Flag is not set in the HTTP response header. Unencrypted connections might access the cookie information, thus making it susceptible to eavesdropping.[CVE\\-2019\\-19090](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-19090)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- ABB recommends users update their version of eSOMS to 6\\.0\\.3 or 6\\.1\\. For additional information and support please contact an ABB service organization. For contact information, see [https://new.abb.com/contact\\-centers](https://new.abb.com/contact-centers)  or see ABB security advisory number [ABBVU\\-PGGA\\-2018035](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107492A9964&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
