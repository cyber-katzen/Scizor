Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.\n\u2022 Implement multi-factor authentication.\n\u2022 Use antivirus software.\n\u2022 Develop internal contact lists and surge support.\nNote:\u00a0this advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK\u00ae) framework, version 10. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)\u2014authored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA)\u2014is part of our continuing cybersecurity mission to warn organizations of cyber threats and help the cybersecurity community reduce the risk presented by these threats. This CSA\u00a0provides an overview of Russian state-sponsored cyber operations; commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); detection actions; incident response guidance; and mitigations. This overview is intended to help the cybersecurity community reduce the risk presented by these threats.\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage the cybersecurity community\u2014especially critical infrastructure network defenders\u2014to adopt a heightened state of awareness and to conduct proactive threat hunting, as outlined in the Detection section. Additionally, CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly urge network defenders to implement the recommendations listed below and detailed in the Mitigations section. These mitigations will help organizations improve their functional resilience by reducing the risk of compromise or severe business degradation.\n\nBe prepared. Confirm reporting processes and minimize personnel gaps in IT/OT security coverage. Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response plan, resilience plan, and continuity of operations plan so that critical functions and operations can be kept running if technology systems are disrupted or need to be taken offline.\nEnhance your organization\u2019s cyber posture. Follow best practices for identity and access management, protective controls and architecture, and vulnerability and configuration management.\nIncrease organizational vigilance. Stay current on reporting on this threat. Subscribe to CISA\u2019s mailing list and feeds to receive notifications when CISA releases information about a security topic or threat.\n\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage critical infrastructure organization leaders to review CISA Insights: Preparing for and Mitigating Cyber Threats for information on reducing cyber threats to their organization.\nClick here\u00a0for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nHistorically, Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors have used common but effective tactics\u2014including spearphishing, brute force, and exploiting known vulnerabilities against accounts and networks with weak security\u2014to gain initial access to target networks. Vulnerabilities known to be exploited by Russian state-sponsored APT actors for initial access include:\n\nCVE-2018-13379 FortiGate VPNs\nCVE-2019-1653 Cisco router\nCVE-2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server\nCVE-2019-7609 Kibana\nCVE-2019-9670 Zimbra software\nCVE-2019-10149 Exim Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\nCVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure\nCVE-2019-19781 Citrix\nCVE-2020-0688 Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2020-4006 VMWare (note: this was a zero-day at time.)\nCVE-2020-5902 F5 Big-IP\nCVE-2020-14882 Oracle WebLogic\nCVE-2021-26855 Microsoft Exchange (Note: this vulnerability is frequently observed used in conjunction with CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065)\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have also demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft and cyber capabilities by compromising third-party infrastructure, compromising third-party software, or developing and deploying custom malware. The actors have also demonstrated the ability to maintain persistent, undetected, long-term access in compromised environments\u2014including cloud environments\u2014by using legitimate credentials.\nIn some cases, Russian state-sponsored cyber operations against critical infrastructure organizations have specifically targeted operational technology (OT)/industrial control systems (ICS) networks with destructive malware. See the following advisories and alerts for information on historical Russian state-sponsored cyber-intrusion campaigns and customized malware that have targeted ICS:\n\nICS Advisory ICS Focused Malware \u2013 Havex\nICS Alert Ongoing Sophisticated Malware Campaign Compromising ICS (Update E)\nICS Alert Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure\nTechnical Alert CrashOverride Malware\nCISA MAR HatMan: Safety System Targeted Malware (Update B)\nCISA ICS Advisory Schneider Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B)\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used sophisticated cyber capabilities to target a variety of U.S. and international critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Defense Industrial Base as well as the Healthcare and Public Health, Energy, Telecommunications, and Government Facilities Sectors. High-profile cyber activity publicly attributed to Russian state-sponsored APT actors by U.S. government reporting and legal actions includes:\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments and aviation networks, September 2020, through at least December 2020. Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation networks. The actors successfully compromised networks and exfiltrated data from multiple victims.\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors\u2019 global Energy Sector intrusion campaign, 2011 to 2018. These Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks, deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors\u2019 campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, 2015 and 2016. Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies, leading to multiple companies experiencing unplanned power outages in December 2015. The actors deployed BlackEnergy malware to steal user credentials and used its destructive malware component, KillDisk, to make infected computers inoperable. In 2016, these actors conducted a cyber-intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian electrical transmission company and deployed CrashOverride malware specifically designed to attack power grids.\n\nFor more information on recent and historical Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see the referenced products below or cisa.gov/Russia.\n\nJoint FBI-DHS-CISA CSA Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Cyber Operations: Trends and Best Practices for Network Defenders\nJoint NSA-FBI-CISA CSA Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments\nJoint FBI-CISA CSA Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Compromises U.S. Government Targets\nJoint CISA-FBI CSA APT Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure, and Elections Organizations\nCISA\u2019s webpage Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise\nCISA Alert Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy Sector and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors\nCISA ICS Alert: Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure\n\nTable 1 provides common, publicly known TTPs employed by Russian state-sponsored APT actors, which map to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 10. Note: these lists are not intended to be all inclusive. Russian state-sponsored actors have modified their TTPs before based on public reporting.[1] Therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA anticipate the Russian state-sponsored actors may modify their TTPs as they deem necessary to reduce their risk of detection.\u00a0\nTable 1: Common Tactics and Techniques Employed by Russian State-Sponsored APT Actors\n\n\n\nTactic\nTechnique\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\n\nReconnaissance [TA0043]\n\n\nActive Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning [T1595.002]\n\n\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have performed large-scale scans in an attempt to find vulnerable servers.\n\n\n\n\nPhishing for Information [T1598]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted spearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.\n\n\n\n\nResource Development [TA0042]\n\n\nDevelop Capabilities: Malware [T1587.001]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have developed and deployed malware, including ICS-focused destructive malware.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\n\nExploit Public Facing Applications [T1190]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors use publicly known vulnerabilities, as well as zero-days, in internet-facing systems to gain access to networks.\n\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain [T1195.002]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have gained initial access to victim organizations by compromising trusted third-party software. Notable incidents include M.E.Doc accounting software and SolarWinds Orion.\n\n\n\n\nExecution [TA0002]\n\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell [T1059.003] and Windows Command Shell [T1059.003]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used cmd.exe to execute commands on remote machines. They have also used PowerShell to create new tasks on remote machines, identify configuration settings, exfiltrate data, and to execute other commands.\n\n\n\n\nPersistence [TA0003]\n\n\nValid Accounts [T1078]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used credentials of existing accounts to maintain persistent, long-term access to compromised networks.\n\n\n\n\nCredential Access [TA0006]\n\n\nBrute Force: Password Guessing [T1110.001] and Password Spraying [T1110.003]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted brute-force password guessing and password spraying campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nOS Credential Dumping: NTDS [T1003.003]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have exfiltrated credentials and exported copies of the Active Directory database ntds.dit.\n\n\n\n\nSteal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting [T1558.003]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have performed \u201cKerberoasting,\u201d whereby they obtained the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Tickets for Active Directory Service Principal Names (SPN) for offline cracking.\n\n\n\n\nCredentials from Password Stores [T1555]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used previously compromised account credentials to attempt to access Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) passwords.\n\n\n\n\nExploitation for Credential Access [T1212]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have exploited Windows Netlogon vulnerability CVE-2020-1472 to obtain access to Windows Active Directory servers.\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured Credentials: Private Keys [T1552.004]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have obtained private encryption keys from the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) container to decrypt corresponding SAML signing certificates.\n\n\n\n\nCommand and Control [TA0011]\n\n\nProxy: Multi-hop Proxy [T1090.003]\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used virtual private servers (VPSs) to route traffic to targets. The actors often use VPSs with IP addresses in the home country of the victim to hide activity among legitimate user traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFor additional enterprise TTPs used by Russian state-sponsored APT actors, see the ATT&CK for Enterprise pages on APT29, APT28, and the Sandworm Team, respectively. For information on ICS TTPs see the ATT&CK for ICS pages on the Sandworm Team, BlackEnergy 3 malware, CrashOveride malware, BlackEnergy\u2019s KillDisk component, and NotPetya malware.\nDetection\nGiven Russian state-sponsored APT actors demonstrated capability to maintain persistent, long-term access in compromised enterprise and cloud environments, CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage all critical infrastructure organizations to:\n\nImplement robust log collection and retention. Without a centralized log collection and monitoring capability, organizations have limited ability to investigate incidents or detect the threat actor behavior described in this advisory. Depending on the environment, examples include:\n\nNative tools such as M365\u2019s Sentinel.\u00a0\nThird-party tools, such as Sparrow, Hawk, or CrowdStrike's Azure Reporting Tool (CRT), to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect unusual activity, service principals, and application activity. Note: for guidance on using these and other detection tools, refer to CISA Alert Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud Environments.\n\n\n\n\nLook for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known Russian state-sponsored TTPs. See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs.\u00a0\n\nTo detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for system and application login failures of valid accounts. Look for multiple, failed authentication attempts across multiple accounts.\nTo detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the below steps:\n\nLook for suspicious \u201cimpossible logins,\u201d such as logins with changing username, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP addresses do not align to the expected user\u2019s geographic location.\nLook for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\nLook for \u201cimpossible travel.\u201d Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a person could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses during the time period between the logins). Note: implementing this detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply VPN solutions before connecting into networks.\nLook for processes and program execution command-line arguments that may indicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the ntds.dit file from a domain controller.\u00a0\nLook for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying user account mitigations.\u00a0\nLook for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\nLook for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor organizations with OT/ICS systems:\u00a0\n\nTake note of unexpected equipment behavior; for example, unexpected reboots of digital controllers and other OT hardware and software.\u00a0\nRecord delays or disruptions in communication with field equipment or other OT devices. Determine if system parts or components are lagging or unresponsive.\n\n\n\nIncident Response\nOrganizations detecting potential APT activity in their IT or OT networks should:\n\nImmediately isolate affected systems.\u00a0\nSecure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\nCollect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\nConsider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that could enable follow-on exploitation.\nReport incidents to CISA and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\n\nNote: for OT assets, organizations should have a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to\u2014or control of\u2014the IT and/or OT environment. Refer to the Mitigations section for more information.\nSee the joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage critical infrastructure owners and operators to see CISA\u2019s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail each step for both incident and vulnerability response. \u00a0\nNote: organizations should document incident response procedures in a cyber incident response plan, which organizations should create and exercise (as noted in the Mitigations section).\u00a0\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their cyber resilience against this threat.\nBe Prepared\nConfirm Reporting Processes and Minimize Coverage Gaps\n\nDevelop internal contact lists. Assign main points of contact for a suspected incident as well as roles and responsibilities and ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident.\nMinimize gaps in IT/OT security personnel availability by identifying surge support for responding to an incident. Malicious cyber actors are known to target organizations on weekends and holidays when there are gaps in organizational cybersecurity\u2014critical infrastructure organizations should proactively protect themselves by minimizing gaps in coverage.\nEnsure IT/OT security personnel monitor key internal security capabilities and can identify anomalous behavior. Flag any identified IOCs and TTPs for immediate response. (See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs).\n\nCreate, Maintain, and Exercise a Cyber Incident Response, Resilience Plan, and Continuity of Operations Plan\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.\nEnsure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident and are positioned to act in a calm and unified manner. Key questions:\n\nDo personnel have the access they need?\nDo they know the processes?\n\n\nFor OT assets/networks,\n\nIdentify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to\u2014or control of\u2014the IT and/or OT environment.\n\nIdentify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections create risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test contingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety critical functions can be maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\n\n\nRegularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or OT networks need to be taken offline.\nImplement data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks. Backup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. Regularly test backup procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable the spread of malware.\nIn addition to backing up data, develop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common devices and critical OT equipment. This can enable more efficient recovery following an incident.\n\n\n\nEnhance your Organization\u2019s Cyber Posture\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend organizations apply the best practices below for identity and access management, protective controls and architecture, and vulnerability and configuration management.\nIdentity and Access Management\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception.\nRequire accounts to have strong passwords and do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access.\nSecure credentials. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated their ability to maintain persistence using compromised credentials.\n\nUse virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are securely stored.\nDisable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.\nConsider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.\nImplement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft: Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\nMinimize the Active Directory attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity. Malicious activity such as \u201cKerberoasting\u201d takes advantage of Kerberos\u2019 TGS and can be used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.\n\n\nSet a strong password policy for service accounts.\nAudit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are monitored for anomalous activity. \u00a0\n\nSecure accounts.\nEnforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the minimum permission they need to do their tasks.\nEnsure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of administrative tasks.\nCreate non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the non- privileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).\n\n\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a threat actor or malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based logs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\nEnable strong spam filters.\n\nEnable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.\nFilter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.\nImplement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments.\n\n\n\nNote: CISA, the FBI, and NSA also recommend, as a longer-term effort, that critical infrastructure organizations implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks.\n\nAppropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network segmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication between the IT and OT networks.\nOrganize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality, consequence, and operational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones. Prohibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network.\n\nVulnerability and Configuration Management\n\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets, in a timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those CVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.\n\nConsider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should participate in the patch management program. \u00a0\nConsider signing up for CISA\u2019s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA\u2019s vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n\n\nUse industry recommended antivirus programs.\n\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-to-date signatures.\nUse a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n\n\nImplement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and mitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses.\nDisable all unnecessary ports and protocols\n\nReview network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control\u00a0 activity.\nTurn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within devices.\n\n\nEnsure OT hardware is in read-only mode.\n\nIncrease Organizational Vigilance\n\nRegularly review reporting on this threat. Consider signing up for CISA notifications to receive timely information on current security issues, vulnerabilities, and high-impact activity.\n\nResources\n\nFor more information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, refer to cisa.gov/Russia.\nRefer to CISA Analysis Report Strengthening Security Configurations to Defend Against Attackers Targeting Cloud Services for steps for guidance on strengthening your organizations cloud security practices.\nLeaders of small businesses and small and local government agencies should see CISA\u2019s Cyber Essentials for guidance on developing an actionable understanding of implementing organizational cybersecurity practices.\nCritical infrastructure owners and operators with OT/ICS networks, should review the following resources for additional information:\n\nNSA and CISA joint CSA NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across Operational Technologies and Control Systems\nCISA factsheet Rising Ransomware Threat to Operational Technology Assets for additional recommendations.\n\n\n\nRewards for Justice Program\nIf you have information on state-sponsored Russian cyber operations targeting U.S. critical infrastructure, contact the Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice Program.
