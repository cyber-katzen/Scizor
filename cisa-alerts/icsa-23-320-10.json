MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released a new version\u00a0(V4.41 or later version)\u00a0for SIPROTEC 4 7SJ66 and recommends users update to the latest version.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-617233 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
