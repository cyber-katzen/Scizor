The vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution. ICS\\-CERT has coordinated with AGG Software, which has developed a patch to address this vulnerability. The researcher has also verified that the patch resolves the issue.Affected Products----------------- This vulnerability affects all OPC SCADA Viewer versions prior to Version 1\\.5\\.2 (Build 110\\).Impact------ A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. The exact impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background----------[AGG Software](http://www.aggsoft.com/)  is a North American company that produces data acquisition, data logging, and monitoring software for hardware interfaces. OPC SCADA Viewer is a tool that displays data received through the OPC interface.Vulnerability Characterization------------------------------### Vulnerability Overview OPC SCADA Viewer is vulnerable to a stack\\-based buffer overflow. An attacker can craft a special configuration file that can allow arbitrary code execution when parsed by OPC SCADA Viewer.#### Exploitability This vulnerability is exploitable from the local machine.#### Existence of Exploit No publicly available exploit is known to exist.#### Difficulty A moderate level of skill is needed to exploit this vulnerability.Mitigation---------- ICS\\-CERT recommends that users of OPC SCADA Viewer take the following mitigation steps:* Update OPC SCADA Viewer to the latest version (1\\.5\\.2 (Build 110\\)) or install Update Version 1\\.5\\.2 build 110 to patch releases since Version 1\\.5\\.0\\.
