[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SICAM A8000=================== Last Revised January 13, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-013\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.9*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SICAM A8000* **Vulnerabilities:**  Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials, Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a privileged user to enable a debug port with default credentials and access to certain log files.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SICAM A8000, a remote terminal unit, are affected:* CP\\-8000 MASTER MODULE WITH I/O \\- 25/\\+70\u00b0C (6MF2101\\-0AB10\\-0AA0\\): All versions prior to v16\\.20* CP\\-8000 MASTER MODULE WITH I/O \\- 40/\\+70\u00b0C (6MF2101\\-1AB10\\-0AA0\\): All versions prior to v16\\.20* CP\\-8021 MASTER MODULE (6MF2802\\-1AA00\\): All versions prior to v16\\.20* CP\\-8022 MASTER MODULE WITH GPRS (6MF2802\\-2AA00\\): All versions prior to v16\\.20### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) An undocumented debug port uses hard\\-coded default credentials. If this port is enabled by a privileged user, an attacker aware of the credentials could access an administrative debug shell on the affected device.[CVE\\-2021\\-45033](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-45033)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) The web server of the affected system allows access to logfiles and diagnostic data generated by a privileged user. An unauthenticated attacker could access the files by knowing the corresponding download links.[CVE\\-2021\\-45034](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-45034)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Messner of Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to [v16\\.20 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109805670)  . As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information about these vulnerabilities, see Siemens\u2019 security advisory [SSA\\-324998](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-324998.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
