Schneider Electric\u2019s security updates for Version 10.6 and Version 11.0 are available at the following location with a user account:\nhttps://wdnresource.wonderware.com/tracking/confirmdownload.aspx?id=3001&url=https://wdnresource.wonderware.com/support/patchfixes/1/WW-ITAA2014P01-LFSEC104.zip&rme=https://wdnresource.wonderware.com/support/patchfixes/1/WW-ITAA2014P01-LFSEC104.txt\nSchneider Electric has released a security bulletin titled \u201cInTouch Access Anywhere Server Security Vulnerability, LFSEC00000104\u201d to announce the security update, which is available at the following location:\nhttps://gcsresource.invensys.com/support/docs/_SecurityBulletins/Security_Bulletin_LFSEC00000104.pdf\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\n",
