A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Kimiya, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Delta Electronics recommends users update to the latest version. Users can obtain the update by contacting Delta Electronics\u2019 corresponding FAE (Field Application Engineer) or solution center. Delta Electronics also recommends the following:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Only use project files from trusted sources.* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  .
