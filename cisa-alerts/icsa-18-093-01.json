MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nSiemens recommends that users upgrade License Management System (LMS) to version 2.1 SP4 (2.1.681) or newer. To do so, users should follow the instructions at https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109479834 or contact the local Siemens representative or Siemens customer support.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nNOTE: Users using Desigo CC MP2.1 or older need to upgrade ALM Manager before applying the update to LMS.\nSiemens has released the following advisory:\nhttps://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-727467.pdf\nNCCIC recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
