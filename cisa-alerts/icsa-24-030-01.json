EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Emerson\nEquipment: Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, GC1500XA\nVulnerabilities: Command Injection, Improper Authentication, Improper Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to run arbitrary commands, access sensitive information, cause a denial-of-service condition, and bypass authentication to acquire admin capabilities.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Emerson Rosemount Gas Chromatographs are affected:\n\nGC370XA: Version 4.1.5 and all prior revisions\nGC700XA: Version 4.1.5 and all prior revisions\nGC1500XA: Version 4.1.5\u00a0and all prior revisions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nIn Emerson Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, and GC1500XA products, an unauthenticated user with network access could execute arbitrary commands in root context from a remote computer.\nCVE-2023-46687\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nIn Emerson Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, and GC1500XA products, an authenticated user with network access could run arbitrary commands from a remote computer.\nCVE-2023-49716\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nIn Emerson Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, and GC1500XA products, an unauthenticated user with network access could bypass authentication and acquire admin capabilities.\nCVE-2023-51761\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nIn Emerson Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, and GC1500XA products, an unauthenticated user with network access could obtain access to sensitive information or cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2023-43609\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy, Chemical\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVera Mens of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to Emerson.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEmerson recommends end users update the affected products' firmware. For update information, contact\u00a0Emerson Tech Support. Emerson recommends end users continue to use current cybersecurity industry best practices, and in the event such infrastructure is not implemented within an end user's network, the user should take action to ensure the affected product is connected to a well-protected network and not connected to the Internet. For more information, refer to the\u00a0Emerson Security\u00a0web page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJanuary 30, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
