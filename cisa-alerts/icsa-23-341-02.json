RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could expose authorized users to clickjacking attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-411L are affected:\n\nR118: V0 - V3\nR119: V0 - V4\nR120: V0 - V5\nR121: V0 - V2\nR122: V0 - V2\nR123: V0 - V2\nR124: V0 - V2\nR125: V0 - V2\nR126: V0 - V3\nR127: V0 - V1\nR128: V0\nR129: V0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021\nAn Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames in the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-411L could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform clickjacking-based attacks against an authenticated and authorized user.\nCVE-2023-2265\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSushant Mane, Parul Sindhwad, Imran Jamadar, and Dr. Faruk Kazi of CoE-CNDS Lab, VJTI, Mumbai, India reported this vulnerability to Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchweitzer Engineering Laboratories has distributed patches to appropriate asset owners. Please refer to their\u00a0security advisory\u00a0for more information.\nSchweitzer Engineering Laboratories also recommends users see product Instruction Manual Appendix A dated 20230830 for more details.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
