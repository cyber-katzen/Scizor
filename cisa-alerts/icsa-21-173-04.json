EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  CODESYS, GmbH* **Equipment:**  CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit* **Vulnerability:**  OS Command Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow the control programmer to call additional OS functions from the PLC logic utilizing the SysFile system library.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS CODESYS reports all runtime systems for Linux based on a CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit 32\\-bit full prior Version 2\\.4\\.7\\.55 are affected.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC\\-based devices to operate as programmable industrial controllers. Control programs can access local or remote input/output (I/O) locations, communication interfaces such as serial ports or sockets, and local system functions such as the file system, real\\-time clock, and other OS functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to call additional OS functions via the SysFile system library.[CVE\\-2021\\-30187](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-30187)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sergey Fedonin and Ivan Kurnak, of Positive Technologies reported this vulnerability to CODESYS.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- CODESYS GmbH has released CODESYS Runtime Toolkit 32\\-bit full Version 2\\.4\\.7\\.55 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for the affected CODESYS products. Please visit the [CODESYS update area](https://www.codesys.com/download)  for more information on how to obtain software updates. As part of a security strategy, CODESYS recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure, ensuring they are not accessible from outside.* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks.* Use VPN (virtual private network) tunnels if remote access is required.* Activate and apply user management and password features.* Use encrypted communication links.* Limit access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.* Protect both development and control system operations by using up to date virus detecting solutions. For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the [CODESYS Security Whitepaper](https://customers.codesys.com/fileadmin/data/customers/security/CODESYS-Security-Whitepaper.pdf)  .
