[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity AdvisoryIncreased Truebot Activity Infects U.S. and Canada Based Networks================================================================= Release Date July 06, 2023 Alert Code AA23\\-187A Related topics:[Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/malware-phishing-and-ransomware)  ,### SUMMARY The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC), and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to cyber threat actors leveraging newly identified Truebot malware variants against organizations in the United States and Canada. As recently as May 31, 2023, the authoring organizations have observed an increase in cyber threat actors using new malware variants of Truebot (also known as [Silence.Downloader](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.silence \"Silence\")  ). Truebot is a botnet that has been used by malicious cyber groups like [CL0P Ransomware Gang](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-158a \"#StopRansomware: CL0P Ransomware Gang Exploits CVE-2023-34362 MOVEit Vulnerability\")  to collect and exfiltrate information from its target victims. Previous Truebot malware variants were primarily delivered by cyber threat actors via malicious phishing email attachments; however, newer versions allow cyber threat actors to also gain initial access through exploiting CVE\\-2022\\-31199\u2014(a remote code execution vulnerability in the Netwrix Auditor application), enabling deployment of the malware at scale within the compromised environment. Based on confirmation from open\\-source reporting and analytical findings of Truebot variants, the authoring organizations assess cyber threat actors are leveraging both phishing campaigns with malicious redirect hyperlinks and CVE\\-2022\\-31199 to deliver new Truebot malware variants. The authoring organizations recommend hunting for the malicious activity using the guidance outlined in this CSA, as well as applying vendor patches to Netwrix Auditor (version 10\\.5\u2014see Mitigations section below).\\[ [1](https://bishopfox.com/blog/netwrix-auditor-advisory \"Netwrix Auditor Advisory\")  ] Any organization identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) within their environment should urgently apply the incident responses and mitigation measures detailed in this CSA and report the intrusion to CISA or the FBI.

See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section below for cyber threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques.* #### **Initial Access and Execution** In recent months, open source reporting has detailed an increase in Truebot malware infections, particularly cyber threat actors using new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and delivery methods.\\[ [2](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/breaking-the-silence-recent-truebot-activity/ \"Breaking the silence - Recent Truebot activity\")  ] Based on the nature of observed Truebot operations, the primary objective of a Truebot infection is to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised host(s) for financial gain \\[ [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\")  ].* Phishing:\t+ Cyber threat actors have historically used malicious phishing emails as the primary delivery method of Truebot malware, which tricks recipients into clicking a hyperlink to execute malware. Cyber threat actors have further been observed concealing email attachments (executables) as software update notifications \\[\t [T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1189/ \"Drive-by Compromise\") \t ] that appear to be legitimate \\[\t [T1204\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1204/002/ \"User Execution: Malicious File\") \t ], \\[\t [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1566/002/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\") \t ]. Following interaction with the executable, users will be redirected to a malicious web domain where script files are then executed. Note: Truebot malware can be hidden within various, legitimate file formats that are used for malicious purposes \\[\t [T1036\\.008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/008/ \"Masquerading: Masquerade File Type\") \t ].\\[\t [3](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/06/12/a-truly-graceful-wipe-out/ \"A Truly Graceful Wipe Out\") \t ]* Exploitation of CVE\\-2022\\-31199:\t+ Though phishing remains a prominent delivery method, cyber threat actors have shifted tactics, exploiting, in observable manner, a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE\\-2022\\-31199\\) in Netwrix Auditor \\[\t [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \t ]\u2014software used for on\\-premises and cloud\\-based IT system auditing. Through exploitation of this CVE, cyber threat actors gain initial access, as well as the ability to move laterally within the compromised network \\[\t [T1210](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1210/ \"Exploitation of Remote Services\") \t ].![Figure 1: CVE-2022-3199 Delivery Method for Truebot](/sites/default/files/styles/ckeditor_medium/public/2023-07/Figure%201%20-%20CVE-2022-3199%20Delivery%20Method%20for%20Truebot.jpg?itok=VzHVn3Ux)*Figure 1: CVE\\-2022\\-31199 Delivery Method for Truebot*  Following the successful download of the malicous file, Truebot renames itself and then loads [FlawedGrace](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0383/ \"FlawedGrace\")  onto the host. Please see the FlawedGrace section below for more information on how this remote access tool (RAT) is used in Truebot operations. After deployment by Truebot, FlawedGrace is able to modify registry \\[ [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1112/ \"Modify Registry\")  ] and [print spooler](https://www.papercut.com/blog/print_basics/printer-spooling-what-is-it-and-how-to-fix-it/ \"Printer spooling: what is it and how to fix it?\")  programs \\[ [T1547\\.012](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1547/012/ \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Print Processors\")  ] that control the order that documents are loaded to a print queue. FlawedGrace manipulates these features to both escalate privilege and establish persistence. During FlawedGrace\u2019s execution phase, the RAT stores encrypted payloads \\[ [T1027\\.009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1027/009/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads\")  ] within the registry. The tool can create scheduled tasks and inject payloads into `msiexec[.]exe`  and `svchost[.]exe`  , which are command processes that enable FlawedGrace to establish a command and control (C2\\) connection to `92.118.36[.]199`  , for example, as well as load dynamic link libraries (DLLs) \\[ [T1055\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1055/001/ \"Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection\")  ] to accomplish privilege escalation. Several hours post initial access, Truebot has been observed injecting [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\")  beacons into memory \\[ [T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1055/ \"Process Injection\")  ] in a dormant mode for the first few hours prior to initiating additional operations. Please see the Cobalt Strike section below for more information on how this remote access tool (RAT) is used in Truebot operations.#### **Discovery and Defense Evasion** During the first stage of Truebot\u2019s execution process, it checks the current version of the operating system (OS) with `RtlGetVersion`  and processor architecture using `GetNativeSystemInfo`  \\[ [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1082/ \"System Information Discovery\")  ].\\[ [4](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar23-187a \"MAR-10445155-1.v1 Truebot Activity Infects U.S. and Canada Based Networks\")  ] **Note:**  This variant of Truebot malware is designed with over one gigabyte (GB) of junk code which functions to hinder detection and analysis efforts \\[ [T1027\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1027/001/)  ]. Following the initial checks for system information, Truebot has the capability to enumerate all running processes \\[ [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1057/ \"Process Discovery\")  ], collect sensitive local host data \\[ [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1005/ \"Data from Local System\")  ], and send this data to an encoded data string described below for second\\-stage execution. Based on IOCs in table 1, Truebot also has the ability to discover software security protocols and system time metrics, which aids in defense evasion, as well as enables synchronization with the compromised system\u2019s internal clock to facilitate scheduling tasks \\[ [T1518\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1518/001/ \"Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery\")  ]\\[ [T1124](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1124/ \"System Time Discovery\")  ]. Next, it uses a `.JSONIP`  extension, (e.g., `IgtyXEQuCEvAM.JSONIP`  ), to create a thirteen character globally unique identifier (GUID)\u2014a 128\\-bit text string that Truebot uses to label and organize the data it collects \\[ [T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/ \"Masquerading\")  ]. After creating the GUID, Truebot compiles and enumerates running process data into either a base64 or unique hexadecimal encoded string \\[ [T1027\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1027/001/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Binary Padding\")  ]. Truebot\u2019s main goal is identifying the presence of security debugger tools. However, the presence of identified debugger tools does not change Truebot\u2019s execution process\u2014the data is compiled into a base64 encoded string for tracking and defense evasion purposes \\[ [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1082/ \"System Information Discovery\")  ]\\[ [T1622](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1622/ \"Debugger Evasion\")  ].#### **Data Collection and Exfiltration** Following Truebot\u2019s enumeration of running processes and tools, the affected system\u2019s computer and domain name \\[ [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1082/ \"System Information Discovery\")  ]\\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ], along with the newly generated GUID, are sent to a hard\\-coded URL in a `POST`  request (as observed in the user\\-agent string). **Note:**  A user\\-agent string is a customized HTTP request that includes specific device information required for interaction with web content. In this instance, cyber threat actors can redirect victims to malicious domains and further establish a C2 connection. The `POST`  request functions as means for establishing a C2 connection for bi\\-lateral communication. With this established connection, Truebot uses a second obfuscated domain to receive additional payloads \\[ [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\")  ], self\\-replicate across the environment \\[ [T1570](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1570/ \"Lateral Tool Transfer\")  ], and/or delete files used in its operations \\[ [T1070\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1070/004/ \"Indicator Removal: File Deletion\")  ]. Truebot malware has the capability to download additional malicious modules \\[ [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\")  ], load shell code \\[ [T1620](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1620/ \"Reflective Code Loading\")  ], and deploy various tools to stealthily navigate an infected network.#### **Associated Delivery Vectors and Tools** Truebot has been observed in association with the following delivery vectors and tools:##### ***Raspberry Robin (Malware)*** Raspberry Robin is a wormable malware with links to other malware families and various infection methods, including installation via USB drive \\[ [T1091](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1091/ \"Replication Through Removable Media\")  ].\\[ [5](https://redcanary.com/blog/raspberry-robin/ \"Raspberry Robin gets the worm early\")  ] Raspberry Robin has evolved into one of the largest malware distribution platforms and has been observed deploying Truebot, as well as other post\\-compromise payloads such as IcedID and Bumblebee malware.\\[ [6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/27/raspberry-robin-worm-part-of-larger-ecosystem-facilitating-pre-ransomware-activity/ \"Raspberry Robin worm part of larger ecosystem facilitating pre-ransomware activity\")  ] With the recent shift in Truebot delivery methods from malicious emails to the exploitation of CVE\\-2022\\-31199, a large number of Raspberry Robin infections have leveraged this exploitable CVE.\\[ [2](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/breaking-the-silence-recent-truebot-activity/ \"Breaking the silence - Recent Truebot activity\")  ]##### [***Flawed Grace***](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0383/ \"FlawedGrace\")***(Malware)*** FlawedGrace is a remote access tool (RAT) that can receive incoming commands \\[ [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\")  ] from a C2 server sent over a custom binary protocol \\[ [T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1095/ \"Non-Application Layer Protocol\")  ] using port 443 to deploy additional tools \\[ [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\")  ].\\[ [7](https://www.telsy.com/flawedgrace-rat/ \"FlawedGrace RAT\")  ] Truebot malware has been observed leveraging (and dropping) FlawedGrace via phishing campaigns as an additional payload \\[ [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1566/002/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\")  ].\\[ [8](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2023/06/carbon-blacks-truebot-detection.html \"Carbon Black\u2019s TrueBot Detection\")  ] **Note:**  FlawedGrace is typically deployed minutes after Truebot malware is executed.##### [***Cobalt Strike***](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\")***(Tool)*** Cobalt Strike is a popular remote access tool (RAT) that cyber threat actors have leveraged\u2014in an observable manner\u2014for a variety of post\\-exploitation means.

Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.2. Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.3. Provision new account credentials.4. Reimage compromised host.5. Report the compromise to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center ( [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\")  or 888\\-282\\-0870\\) or contact your local FBI [field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\")  . State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to MS\\-ISAC ( [SOC@cisecurity.org](mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org \"Report to MS-ISAC\")  or 866\\-787\\-4722\\).### **MITIGATIONS** CISA and the authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the below mitigations, including mandating [phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\")  for all staff and services. For additional best practices, see CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  (CPGs). The CPGs, developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are a prioritized subset of IT and OT security practices that can meaningfully reduce the likelihood and impact of known cyber risks and common TTPs. Because the CPGs are a subset of best practices, CISA and co\\-sealers recommend software manufacturers implement a comprehensive information security program based on a recognized framework, such as the NIST [Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework \"Cybersecurity Framework\")  (CSF).* Apply patches to CVE\\-2022\\-31199* Update Netwrix Auditor to [version 10\\.5](https://bishopfox.com/blog/netwrix-auditor-advisory \"Netwrix Auditor Advisory\") Netwrix recommends using their Auditor application only on internally facing networks. System owners that don't follow this recommendation, and use the application in externally facing instances, are at increased risk to having CVE\\-2022\\-31199 exploited on their systems. Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:* **Implementing application controls to manage and control execution of software**  , including allowlisting remote access programs.\t+ Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation. See the National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Information sheet, [Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180334/-1/-1/0/Enforce%20Signed%20Software%20Execution%20Policies%20-%20Copy.pdf \"ENFORCE SIGNED SOFTWARE EXECUTION POLICIES\")  , and additional guidance below:* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services**  . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[ [CPG 2\\.W](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ]:\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\t+ Apply phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).\t+ Log RDP login attempts.* **Disable command\\-line and scripting activities and permissions**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.N](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* Restrict the use of PowerShell by using Group Policy, and only grant to specific users on a case\\-by\\-case basis.

Logs from Windows PowerShell prior to version 5\\.0 are either non\\-existent or do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities \\[ [CPG 1\\.E, 2\\.S, 2\\.T](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Enable enhanced PowerShell logging**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.T, 2\\.U](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].\t+ PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and possible IOCs of a cyber threat actor\u2019s PowerShell use.\t+ Ensure PowerShell instances, using the latest version, have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).\t+ The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log and the PowerShell Operational Log. The authoring organizations recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.* **Configure the Windows Registry to require User Account Control (UAC) approval for any PsExec operations**  requiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories**  for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[ [CPG 4\\.C](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Audit user accounts**  with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) \\[ [CPG 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:\t+ **Place domain admin accounts in the protected users\u2019 group** \t to prevent caching of password hashes locally.\t+ **Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016** \t (Refer to\t [Microsoft: Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage \"Microsoft: Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard\") \t for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\t+ **Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts** \t .* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.A, 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ]. For example, the Just\\-in\\-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the [Zero Trust](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Feb/25/2002588479/-1/-1/0/CSI_EMBRACING_ZT_SECURITY_MODEL_UOO115131-21.PDF \"Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model\")  model). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory (AD) level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task. In addition, CISA, FBI, MS\\-ISAC, and CCCS recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:* **Disable File and Printer sharing services**  . If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.* **Implement a recovery plan**  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).* **Maintain offline backups of data**  and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization minimizes the impact of disruption to business practices as they can retrieve their data \\[ [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Require all accounts**  with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) **to comply**  with [National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\")  for developing and managing password policies.\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters \\[\t [CPG 2\\.B](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \t ].\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\t [CPG 2\\.C](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \t ].\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\t [CPG 2\\.G](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \t ].\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\t**Note:** \t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication**  for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems \\[ [CPG 2\\.H](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date**  . Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Organizations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to 48 hours of vulnerability disclosure. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet\\-facing systems \\[ [CPG 1\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Segment networks**  to prevent the spread of ransomware.

To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections, as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[ [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software**  on all hosts.* **Disable unused ports**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.V](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Consider adding an email banner to emails**  received from outside your organization \\[ [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable**  (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[ [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  ].### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 5\\-13\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4.
