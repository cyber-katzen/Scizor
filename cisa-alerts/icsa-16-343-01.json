[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryMoxa MiiNePort Session Hijack Vulnerabilities============================================= Last Revised December 08, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-343\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Aditya Sood has identified vulnerabilities in Moxa\u2019s MiiNePort. Moxa has produced new firmware editions to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Moxa reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of MiiNePort:* MiiNePort E1 versions prior to 1\\.8,* MiiNePort E2 versions prior to 1\\.4, and* MiiNePort E3 versions prior to 1\\.1IMPACT------ An attacker may be able to gain user\\-level access to the target system by exploiting these vulnerabilities. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Moxa is a Taiwan\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, the UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil. The affected product, MiiNePort, is a serial device server module. According to Moxa, MiiNePort is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLSCWE\\-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264\\.html, web site last accessed December 08, 2016\\.

Moxa recommends installing these new firmware editions:* MiiNePort E1 Series, Edition 1\\.8 [http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type\\=support\\&id\\=1214](http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type=support&id=1214)* MiiNePort E2 Series, Edition 1\\.4 [http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type\\=support\\&id\\=263](http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type=support&id=263)* MiiNePort E3 Series, Edition 1\\.1 [http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type\\=support\\&id\\=2058](http://www.moxa.com/support/download.aspx?type=support&id=2058) ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
