EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC CP 1543-1\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation, Improper Privilege Management\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-16-327-01 Siemens SIMATIC CP 1543-1 Vulnerabilities that was published November 22, 2016, on the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to elevate privileges on the affected devices or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the SIMATIC CP 1543-1 communication processor:\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC CP 1543-1 (6GK7543-1AX00-0XE0): All versions prior to v2.0.28\nSIPLUS NET CP 1543-1 (6AG1543-1AX00-2XE0): All versions prior to v2.0.28\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nUsers with elevated privileges to TIA-Portal and project data on the engineering station could possibly get privileged access on affected devices.\nCVE-2016-8561 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nUnder special conditions, it may be possible to write SNMP variables on Port 161/UDP that should be read-only and should only be configured with TIA-Portal. A write to these variables could reduce the availability or cause a denial of service.\nCVE-2016-8562 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nThese vulnerabilities were coordinated directly with Siemens by SOGETI and Agence nationale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information (ANSSI).\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions.:\n\nSIMATIC CP 1543-1: Update to v2.0.28 or later version\u00a0\nSIPLUS NET CP 1543-1: Update to v2.0.28 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-672373\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n",
