EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Mitsubishi Electric\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0MELSOFT iQ AppPortal\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0HTTP Request Smuggling, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a malicious attacker to make unidentified impacts such as authentication bypass, information disclosure, denial-of-service, or bypass IP address authentication.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Mitsubishi Electric products and versions are affected:\u00a0\n\nMELSOFT iQ AppPortal (SW1DND-IQAPL-M): v1.00A to 1.29F\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0INCONSISTENT INTERPRETATION OF HTTP REQUESTS ('HTTP REQUEST/RESPONSE SMUGGLING') CWE-444\u00a0\nMELSOFT iQ AppPortal: v1.00A to 1.29F contains a flaw that could result in unidentified impacts such as authentication bypass, information disclosure, or a denial-of-service condition in Apache HTTP Server used by VisualSVN Server.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-26377\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345\u00a0\nMELSOFT iQ AppPortal: v1.00A to 1.29F contains a flaw that could result in IP address authentication bypass in the Apache HTTP Server used by VisualSVN Server.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-31813\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMitsubishi Electric reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends downloading and applying update\u00a0version 1.32J\u00a0or later software.\u00a0\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users apply the following workarounds or mitigation measures to minimize the risk:\u00a0\n\nDisable mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp in the VisualSVN Server settings if possible.\u00a0\nWhen a PC with the product installed needs access to the internet, use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access.\u00a0\nUse a PC with the product installed within a local area network (LAN) and use a firewall, etc. to minimize connection to the network and restrict access only from trusted networks and hosts.\u00a0\nMinimize user privilege for the product users.\u00a0\nInstall antivirus software on the computer where the product is used.\u00a0\n\nUsers should contact Mitsubishi Electric for assistance, if needed.\u00a0\nFor specific update instructions and additional details see the\u00a0Mitsubishi Electric advisory. \u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
