Vanderbilt has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of Siemens-branded IP cameras built by Vanderbilt Industries:\n\nCCMW3025: All versions prior to 1.41_SP18_S1,\nCVMW3025-IR: All versions prior to 1.41_SP18_S1,\nCFMW3025: All versions prior to 1.41_SP18_S1,\nCCPW3025: All versions prior to 0.1.73_S1,\nCCPW5025: All versions prior to 0.1.73_S1,\nCCMD3025-DN18: All versions prior to v1.394_S1,\nCCID1445-DN18: All versions prior to v2635,\nCCID1445-DN28: All versions prior to v2635,\nCCID1445-DN36: All versions prior to v2635,\nCFIS1425: All versions prior to v2635,\nCCIS1425: All versions prior to v2635,\nCFMS2025: All versions prior to v2635,\nCCMS2025: All versions prior to v2635,\nCVMS2025-IR: All versions prior to v2635,\nCFMW1025: All versions prior to v2635, and\nCCMW1025: All versions prior to v2635.\n\nIMPACT\nA successful exploit of this vulnerability may allow the attacker to obtain administrative credentials.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nVanderbilt Industries acquired the SIEMENS IP Cameras business in June 2015 and released updates for the affected camera models under the SIEMENS brand.\nThe SIEMENS-branded IP-based CCTV cameras portfolio includes a range of megapixel cameras in various configuration and mounting options. According to Vanderbilt, these products are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, and Government Facilities. Vanderbilt estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html, web site last accessed November 17, 2016.\n\nAn attacker with network access to the web server could obtain administrative credentials by sending certain requests.\nCVE-2016-9155NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9155, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

For links to the new versions for each of the affected models, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-284765 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nSiemens recommends that users operate the devices within trusted networks and protect network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens also recommends enabling authentication on the web server.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
