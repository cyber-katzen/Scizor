[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryVanderbilt Industries Siemens IP CCTV Cameras Vulnerability=========================================================== Last Revised November 17, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-322\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Siemens reports that there is a vulnerability in Siemens\\-branded IP cameras from Vanderbilt Industries. Vanderbilt has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of Siemens\\-branded IP cameras built by Vanderbilt Industries:* CCMW3025: All versions prior to 1\\.41\\_SP18\\_S1,* CVMW3025\\-IR: All versions prior to 1\\.41\\_SP18\\_S1,* CFMW3025: All versions prior to 1\\.41\\_SP18\\_S1,* CCPW3025: All versions prior to 0\\.1\\.73\\_S1,* CCPW5025: All versions prior to 0\\.1\\.73\\_S1,* CCMD3025\\-DN18: All versions prior to v1\\.394\\_S1,* CCID1445\\-DN18: All versions prior to v2635,* CCID1445\\-DN28: All versions prior to v2635,* CCID1445\\-DN36: All versions prior to v2635,* CFIS1425: All versions prior to v2635,* CCIS1425: All versions prior to v2635,* CFMS2025: All versions prior to v2635,* CCMS2025: All versions prior to v2635,* CVMS2025\\-IR: All versions prior to v2635,* CFMW1025: All versions prior to v2635, and* CCMW1025: All versions prior to v2635\\.IMPACT------ A successful exploit of this vulnerability may allow the attacker to obtain administrative credentials. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Vanderbilt Industries acquired the SIEMENS IP Cameras business in June 2015 and released updates for the affected camera models under the SIEMENS brand. The SIEMENS\\-branded IP\\-based CCTV cameras portfolio includes a range of megapixel cameras in various configuration and mounting options. According to Vanderbilt, these products are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, and Government Facilities. Vanderbilt estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIAL **SCWE\\-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522\\.html, web site last accessed November 17, 2016\\.** An attacker with network access to the web server could obtain administrative credentials by sending certain requests. CVE\\-2016\\-9155NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-9155, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 17, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- Vanderbilt has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability. For links to the new versions for each of the affected models, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-284765 at the following location:<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> Siemens recommends that users operate the devices within trusted networks and protect network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens also recommends enabling authentication on the web server. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
