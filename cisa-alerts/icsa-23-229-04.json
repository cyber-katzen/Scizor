EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Walchem\nEquipment: Intuition 9\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to download and export sensitive data or grant an attacker direct login to a device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Intuition 9, a water treatment controller, are affected:\u00a0\n\n\nIntuition 9: versions prior to v4.21\n\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nWalchem Intuition 9 firmware versions prior to v4.21 are missing authentication for some of the API routes of the management web server. This could allow an attacker to download and export sensitive data.\nCVE-2023-38422 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nWalchem Intuition 9 firmware versions prior to v4.21 are vulnerable to improper authentication. Login credentials are stored in a format that could allow an attacker to use them as-is to login and gain access to the device.\nCVE-2023-32202 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNoam Moshe of Claroty Research - Team82 reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWalchem recommends upgrading all Intuition 9 firmware versions to v4.21 or later. The upgrade can be downloaded from the Walchem website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities have been reported to CISA at this time.\n",
