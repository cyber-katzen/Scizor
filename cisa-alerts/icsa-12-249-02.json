This alert detailed a vulnerability report of \u201chard-coded\u201d credentials and improper access controls in the WAGO I/O System 758 product line.\nResearcher Reid Wightman of Digital Bond released these vulnerabilities without coordination with ICS-CERT or WAGO. After coordination with the researcher and the vendor, ICS-CERT determined that the improper authentication vulnerability is found in a third-party component used in multiple WAGO products. ICS-CERT is also coordinating this vulnerability with 3-S Smart Software Solutions, the third-party supplier. ICS-CERT will update an advisory with additional information from 3S as it becomes available.\nWAGO has confirmed that its I/O System 758 products are configured with default operating system credentials. These credentials are disclosed, but WAGO provided no information on how to change the default passwords. WAGO has released a procedure with additional documentation on how to change the default operating system passwords in Models 758-874, 758-875, and 758-876. WAGO has also released a best security practices document that makes recommendations to its customers on how to best secure its industrial control system (ICS) products.\nThese vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits are known to exist.\nAffected Products\nThe following WAGO products are affected:\n\nI/O System 758, Model 758-870,\nI/O System 758, Model 758-874,\nI/O System 758, Model 758-875, and\nI/O System 758, Model 758-876.\n\nImpact\nAttackers are able to exploit these vulnerabilities by using the default credentials to gain unauthorized administrative access to the systems.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nAccording to WAGO\u2019s Web site, WAGO is an international company based in Germany. They operate production facilities in Germany, Switzerland, Poland, China, and India. WAGO maintains offices worldwide.\nAccording to WAGO, its products are deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, building automation, electric generation, transportation, and others. WAGO estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nUse of Hard-Coded PasswordCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html, CWE-259: Use of Hard-Coded Password, Web site last accessed September 05, 2012.\nThe operating system software of the WAGO I/O System 758 product line uses three user accounts with default passwords and no method to change these passwords. An attacker could use the default password to gain administrative control through the Telnet service of the systemleading to a loss of integrity, loss of confidentiality, or loss of availability.\nCVE-2012-3013 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).\nImproper AuthenticationCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html, CWE-287: Improper Authentication, Web site last accessed September 05, 2012.\nWAGO IPCs offer the 3-S Smart Software Solutions CoDeSys runtime to program the IPC similar to a programmable logic controller. The CoDeSys software allows unauthenticated connections to the server to run arbitrary commands. This could allow possible remote code execution. A separate advisory with a CVE number and CVSS score will be published by ICS-CERT for this vulnerability as more information becomes available.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities could be remotely exploited.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nWAGO has developed a procedure for the I/O System 758, Models 758-874, 758-875, and 758-876 that allows users to change passwords for their default operating system accounts. The WAGO Security Settings Application Note discusses changing the Web-based Management passwords as well as the Linux console passwords and list security recommendations for their customers. This procedure does not provide instructions to change the default passwords on the I/O System 758, Model 758-870 as it is no longer being produced. WAGO has released a cybersecurity notification\u00a0 to its customers that details the best security settings and practices for its ICS products.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
