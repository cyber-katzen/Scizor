OSIsoft has produced a new version of Data Archive (Version 3\\.4\\.395\\.64\\) to mitigate these issues.\n \n\n\n\n Some of these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n OSIsoft reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions:\n \n\n\n* All versions of the PI Data Archive prior to Version 3\\.4\\.395\\.64\\.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n An attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities could create a denial\\-of\\-service condition or allow remote code execution on the Windows OS running this software.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n The issues were rated by OSIsoft using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)CVSS Calculator, https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?adv\\&calculator\\&version\\=2, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\. as follows:\n \n\n\n* 21 high (CVSS: 6\\.8\\-10\\),\n* 27 medium (CVSS: 3\\.4\\-6\\.7\\), and\n* 8 low (CVSS: 0\\-3\\.3\\).\n\n\n\n The high\\-level security issues that are addressed in PI Data Archive 2015 include:\n \n\n\n* CWE\\-20CWE\\-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\\.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\.: Improper Input Validation (6 issues),\n* CWE\\-250CWE\\-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250\\.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\.: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (3 issues),\n* CWE\\-200CWE\\-200: Information Exposure, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200\\.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\.: Information Exposure (1 issue),\n* CWE\\-476CWE\\-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400\\.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\.: NULL Pointer Dereference / Denial of Service (13 issues), and\n* CWE\\-384CWE\\-384: Session Fixation, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384\\.html, web site last accessed August 13, 2015\\.: Session Management (2 issues).\n\n\n\n These security\\-related issues were discovered in PI Data Archive 2012 as part of OSIsoft\u2019s SDL process.\n \n\n\n### VULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\n\n#### EXPLOITABILITY\n\n\n\n Some of these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\n#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n OSIsoft recommends that users upgrade to Data Archive 3\\.4\\.395\\.64 released June 25, 2015\\.\n \n\n\n\n Users may download the latest software version from the following web site:\n \n\n\n\n https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Downloads/All\\-Downloads/PI\\-Server/PI\\-Data\\-Archive/All\\-Installation\\-Kits\n \n\n\n\n Users may download release notes for the latest software version from the following web site:\n \n\n\n\n https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Downloads/All\\-Downloads/PI\\-Server/PI\\-Data\\-Archive/Release\\-Notes\n \n\n\n\n For more information regarding this vulnerability and the recommended mitigation plan, please see OSIsoft\u2019s security bulletin titled \u201cAdvisory: PI Server 2015 Multiple Security Updates\u201d at the following location:\n \n\n\n\n https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/\n \n\n\n\n Users may also visit the OSIsoft technical support web site: https://techsupport.osisoft.com/\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n OSIsoft is a US\\-based company that maintains its headquarters in San Leandro, California, with operations globally.\n \n\n\n\n According to OSIsoft, Data Archive is the core server technology used in the PI System for real time data storage and distribution of instrument data. The PI System uses this core server technology to manage and enhance stored instrument data for retrieval, analysis, and visualization. According to OSIsoft, PI Asset Framework is deployed in several critical infrastructure sectors. OSIsoft estimates that these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nHELPFUL DOCUMENTATION\n---------------------\n\n\n\n Severity Matrix is as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n| Low CVSS 0\\-3\\.3 | Medium CVSS 3\\.4\\-6\\.7 | High CVSS 6\\.8\\-10 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n\n NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/).\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* OSIsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-15-225-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
