[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SPCanywhere App Vulnerabilities======================================= Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-064\\-05OVERVIEW-------- Karsten Sohr, Bernhard Berger, and Kai Hillmann from the TZI\\-Bremen, Kim Schlyter, Seyton\u00a0Bradford, and Richard Warren from FortConsult, and Stefan Schuhmann have identified vulnerabilities in the Siemens SPCanywhere mobile application. Siemens has produced a new mobile application called SPC Connect that mitigates this vulnerability. Some of these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely; others require local access.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SPCanywhere versions are affected:* SPCanywhere Android Application: All versions, and* SPCanywhere iOS Application: All versions.IMPACT------ An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities may be able to capture or modify privileged information, inject code, or bypass access control. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. The affected product, SPCanywhere is a mobile application that allows users to access Siemens SPC intrusion alarm systems remotely via mobile phone. It allows users to view and control several sites, enable or disable SPC intrusion alarm systems, open doors, control outputs, and check the status of the installation. According to Siemens, SPCanywhere is deployed primarily in building automation. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATACWE\\-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311\\.html, web site last accessed March 05, 2015\\.

The new solution fixes all of the vulnerabilities listed above. \u00a0Siemens strongly recommends that all users migrate to the new solution. For a smooth transition, SPCanywhere will continue to be available in the mobile application stores for a few more months. It will then be removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The new app SPC Connect for Android can be obtained via Google\u2019s Play Store:[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\\=com.siemens.spcconnect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siemens.spcconnect)  The new app SPC Connect for iOS can be obtained via Apple\u2019s App Store:<https://itunes.apple.com/app/id948318844> Further information on the new solution SPC Connect can be found here:<http://www.spcconnect.com> Registered users can obtain the new controller firmware version from:<https://is.spiap.com/products/intrusion/spc/centrales.html> For more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-185226 at the following location:<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.2.
