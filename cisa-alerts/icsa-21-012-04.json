MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has published a [security advisory](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  and released an update to Version SE2021MP2 or later for Solid Edge and recommends users [update to the latest version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  (login required). Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Siemens recommends limiting opening of untrusted files from unknown sources in Solid Edge.* Applying a defense\\-in\\-depth concept can help to reduce the probability untrusted code is run on the system. Siemens recommends applying the [defense\\-in\\-depth](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  concept. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and follow the recommendations in the product manual. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA\\-979834](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
