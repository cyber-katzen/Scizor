EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Red Lion\nEquipment: FlexEdge Gateway, DA50A, DA70A running Crimson\nVulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to truncate passwords configured by the Crimson configuration tool which could create weaker than intended credentials.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Red Lion products are affected:\n\nCrimson: v3.2.0053.18 or prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF NULL BYTE OR NUL CHARACTER CWE-158\nThe Crimson 3.2 Windows-based configuration tool allows users with administrative access to define new passwords for users and to download the resulting security configuration to a device. If such a password contains the percent (%) character, invalid values will be included, potentially truncating the string if a NUL is encountered. If the simplified password is not detected by the administrator, the device might be left in a vulnerable state as a result of more-easily compromised credentials. Note that passwords entered via the Crimson system web server do not suffer from this vulnerability.\nCVE-2023-5719\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAlexander Ratelle of Hepburn Engineering Inc, reported this vulnerability to Red Lion.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRed Lion recommends updating the Crimson configuration tool to version 3.2.0063 or later by using the automatic update feature or visiting the\u00a0Red Lion website.\nAny existing or new accounts created should refrain from using the percent (%) character in the configured password in versions 3.2.0053.18 or below.\nFor more information refer to Red Lion's security advisory\u00a0RLCSIM-2023-04.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
