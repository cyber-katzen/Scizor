The CGI script is a Pulse Secure file, maliciously modified to siphon login credentials to a file stored in the /tmp directory on the compromised Pulse Secure device. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.\nFor a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise, see: MAR-10334057-3.v1.stix.\nSubmitted Files (1)\nb1d8fe6806fb8539a3d059ca5a3abfbf4797ca862fc28f67b5091db5c2edce51 (OrphanFile-58641)\n\nFindings\n\nb1d8fe6806fb8539a3d059ca5a3abfbf4797ca862fc28f67b5091db5c2edce51\nTags\ncredential-harvestertrojan\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nOrphanFile-58641\n\n\nSize\n109043 bytes\n\n\nType\nPerl script text executable\n\n\nMD5\n41fdce8fc6d724cc9b9d7fc2706e5039\n\n\nSHA1\n86b344e5f5bb6087b3bdf57ab2cec474c4ec1f51\n\n\nSHA256\nb1d8fe6806fb8539a3d059ca5a3abfbf4797ca862fc28f67b5091db5c2edce51\n\n\nSHA512\n6c818570d067a670d987d61142773ccb29ab8deba0a45d58d540672ba02472dad6d894a5e5f1b5c98f4baf1ce0446a9e6b8b6f569b751130124c14f7c3db955e\n\n\nssdeep\n768:XfTsQR8rYZ8HPGK9P97HfHq/RgktsBOBxrce/6ZRc7egTrR+5x/yQ8AVHj9KqTcE:uzD26x6/J7/T1eaQ8AVHj9vTcGGP0\n\n\nEntropy\n4.712459\n\n\n\nAntivirus\nNo matches found.\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nDescription\nThis CGI script is a Pulse Secure file, maliciously modified by the attacker to siphon login credentials to a file named \"dswebserver.statementcounters\", stored in the /tmp directory of the compromised Pulse Secure device. The malicious code starts from \"my $uf=\" and ends at \"close (*FN);\" (Figure 1 and 2).\nScreenshots\n \n\nFigure 1 - Screenshot of the malicious code added by the attacker to store login credentials.\n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Screenshot of the malicious code added by the attacker to store login credentials.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.

A Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) is intended to provide organizations with malware analysis in a timely manner. In most instances this report will provide initial indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\nWhat is a MAR? A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is intended to provide organizations with more detailed malware analysis acquired via manual reverse engineering. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\nCan I edit this document?
