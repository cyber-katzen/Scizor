Summary      Description     CISA received one Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for analysis. The CGI script is a Pulse Secure file, maliciously modified to siphon login credentials to a file stored in the /tmp directory on the compromised Pulse Secure device. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.     For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise, see:  [MAR\\-10334057\\-3\\.v1\\.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10334057.r3.v1.WHITE.stix.xml)   .

Description     This CGI script is a Pulse Secure file, maliciously modified by the attacker to siphon login credentials to a file named \"dswebserver.statementcounters\", stored in the /tmp directory of the compromised Pulse Secure device. The malicious code starts from \"my $uf\\=\" and ends at \"close (\\*FN);\" (Figure 1 and 2\\).     Screenshots        **Figure 1 \\-**   Screenshot of the malicious code added by the attacker to store login credentials.         **Figure 2 \\-**   Screenshot of the malicious code added by the attacker to store login credentials.       Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
