EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\n\nATTENTION: Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: (BD) Becton, Dickinson and Company\nEquipment: Alaris Gateway Workstation\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nExploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized arbitrary code execution, which could allow an attacker to view and edit device status and configuration details as well as cause devices to become unavailable. The vendor has stated the affected products are not sold in the United States.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of BD\u2019s Alaris Gateway Workstation are affected:\nFor the Alaris Gateway Workstation Web Browser User Interface vulnerability:\n\n1.0.13\n1.1.3 Build 10\n1.1.3 MR Build 11\n1.1.5\n1.1.6\n\nThis does not impact the latest firmware Versions 1.3.2 and 1.6.1\nFor the Alaris Gateway Workstation Dangerous File Upload vulnerability:\n\n1.1.3 Build 10\n1.1.3 MR Build 11\n1.3.0 Build 14\n1.3.1 Build 13\n\nThis does not impact the latest firmware Versions 1.3.2 and 1.6.1\nAdditionally, this notification applies to the following products using software Version 2.3.6 and below:\n\nAlaris GS\nAlaris GH\nAlaris CC\nAlaris TIVA\n\nOnly software versions for 2.3.6 and below are impacted. Software Version 2.3.6 was released in 2006. These pumps were previously sold under the Asena brand. This does not apply to Alaris Medley devices.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe web browser user interface on the Alaris Gateway Workstation does not prevent an attacker with knowledge of the IP address of the Alaris Gateway Workstation terminal to gain access to the status and configuration information of the device.\nCVE-2019-10962 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThe application does not restrict the upload of malicious files during a firmware update.\nCVE-2019-10959 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Europe, Asia\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nElad Luz of CyberMDX reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nBD recommends the following mitigations and compensating controls in order to reduce risk associated with these vulnerabilities.\nFor the Alaris Gateway Workstation Web Browser User Interface vulnerability:\n\nBD recommends using the latest firmware, Version 1.3.2 or 1.6.1\nUsers should ensure only appropriate associates have access to their network\nUsers should isolate their network from untrusted systems\n\nFor the Alaris Gateway Workstation Dangerous File Upload vulnerability:\n\nBD recommends users block the SMB protocol\nUsers should segregate their VLAN network\nUsers should ensure only appropriate associates have access to the network.\n\nBD is currently assessing additional remediation efforts, including an adjustment to restrict the SMB protocol.\nFor more information on BD\u2019s product security and vulnerability management, contact BD\u2019s Product Security Office at:\nhttps://www.bd.com/en-us/support/product-security-and-privacy/product-security-bulletins\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all medical devices and/or systems.\nLocate medical devices behind firewalls and isolate them where possible.\nRestrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.\nApply defense-in-depth strategies.\nDisable any unnecessary accounts, protocols and services.\nWhere additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA at the following location:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
