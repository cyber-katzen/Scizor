A malicious attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain information, modify information, and cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-14521 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMashav Sapir of Claroty reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigations:\n--------- Begin Update K Part 1 of 1 ---------\u00a0\nRefer to the Mitsubishi Electric website for details on available patches and countermeasures.\n--------- End Update K Part 1 of 1 ---------\u00a0\nDownload the latest version of each software product and update it.\u00a0\nRefer to the manual for help to update affected products.\nFor users of a product that has not released a fixed version or who cannot immediately update the product, Mitsubishi Electric recommends taking the following mitigation measures to minimize risk:\n\nIf a \u201cFile Name Warning\u201d message is displayed when starting Windows, take appropriate measures according to the instructions in the message (such as changing a file name) and then install or operate the products.\nOperate the products under an account that does not have administrator privileges.\nInstall an antivirus software in computers using the products.\nRestrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary and ensure they are not accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the network.\nUse virtual private network (VPN) when remote access is required.\n\nAdditional information about the vulnerabilities or Mitsubishi Electric's compensating control is available by contacting a Mitsubishi Electric representative.\u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
