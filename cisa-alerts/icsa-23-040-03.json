A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [SENSITIVE COOKIE IN HTTPS SESSION WITHOUT 'SECURE' ATTRIBUTE CWE\\-614](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html)** System Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15 are vulnerable during a cross\\-site scripting attack. This could allow an attacker to access cookies and take control of an affected system.[CVE\\-2022\\-21940](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21940)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Johnson Controls, Inc. reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Johnson Controls recommends users take the following actions to mitigate the vulnerabilities.* Update SCT version 14 with patch 14\\.2\\.3* Update SCT version 15 with patch 15\\.0\\.3* Contact your local Johnson Controls office or Authorized Building Control Specialists (ABCS)* For more detailed mitigation instructions, please see [Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI\\-PSA\\-2022\\-07 v1](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions/security-advisories) CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.
