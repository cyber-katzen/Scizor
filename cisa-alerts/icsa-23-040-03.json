EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Johnson Controls\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0\u00a0System Configuration Tool\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Sensitive Cookie Without \u2018HttpOnly\u2019 Flag, Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to access cookies and take over the user's session.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of System Configuration Tool (SCT) are affected:\u00a0\n\nSystem Configuration Tool (SCT) version 14: Versions prior to 14.2.3\u00a0\nSystem Configuration Tool (SCT) version 15: Versions prior to 15.0.3\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0SENSITIVE COOKIE WITHOUT 'HTTPONLY' FLAG CWE-1004\u00a0\nSystem Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15 are vulnerable during a cross-site scripting attack. This could allow an attacker to access cookies and take control of an affected system.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-21939\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0SENSITIVE COOKIE IN HTTPS SESSION WITHOUT 'SECURE' ATTRIBUTE CWE-614\u00a0\nSystem Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15 are vulnerable during a cross-site scripting attack. This could allow an attacker to access cookies and take control of an affected system.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-21940\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Ireland\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc. reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends users take the following actions to mitigate the vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n\nUpdate SCT version 14 with patch 14.2.3\u00a0\nUpdate SCT version 15 with patch 15.0.3\u00a0\nContact your local Johnson Controls office or Authorized Building Control Specialists (ABCS)\u00a0\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see\u00a0Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2022-07 v1\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
