They have issued \u201cService Bulletin 462\u201d and a letter to users to inform them of the availability of free upgrades (firmware Version 17Q2.1) to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nOPW recommends that users upgrade all affected systems even if they are already protected from exploitation by running off-line or located on a protected network.\nOPW has released instructions telling users how to update to the newest firmware version. For specific step-by-step instructions on how to save settings, backup database, and install the new firmware, see the upgrade procedure (M00-20-4438) at the following location:\nhttp://www.opwglobal.com/docs/libraries/manuals/electronic-systems/opw-fms-manuals/m00-20-4438-integra-software-upgrade.pdf?sfvrsn=14\nMore information can also be found in the configuration guide:\nhttp://www.opwglobal.com/opw-fms/tech-support/manuals-how-to-videos/technical-manuals\nFor additional assistance, users and distributors may call the technical service line at 877-OPW-TECH (877-679-8324). OPW has also dedicated an additional phone number specifically for addressing this issue: 312-244-0632. Users may also email FMSOrders@DoverFS.com or contact their commercial district manager.\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\n\nAn attacker may create an application user account to gain administrative privileges.\nCVE-2017-12733 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\n\nThe application is vulnerable to injection of malicious SQL queries via the input from the client.\nCVE-2017-12731 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nSemen Rozhkov of Kaspersky Lab discovered these vulnerabilities. OPW hired a third party testing firm to validate that the firmware upgrade resolved the security issues.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Energy, Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: United States\n",
