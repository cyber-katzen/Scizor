They have issued \u201cService Bulletin 462\u201d and a letter to users to inform them of the availability of free upgrades (firmware Version 17Q2\\.1\\) to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n OPW recommends that users upgrade all affected systems even if they are already protected from exploitation by running off\\-line or located on a protected network.\n \n\n\n\n OPW has released instructions telling users how to update to the newest firmware version. For specific step\\-by\\-step instructions on how to save settings, backup database, and install the new firmware, see the upgrade procedure (M00\\-20\\-4438\\) at the following location:\n \n\n\n\n[http://www.opwglobal.com/docs/libraries/manuals/electronic\\-systems/opw\\-fms\\-manuals/m00\\-20\\-4438\\-integra\\-software\\-upgrade.pdf?sfvrsn\\=14](http://www.opwglobal.com/docs/libraries/manuals/electronic-systems/opw-fms-manuals/m00-20-4438-integra-software-upgrade.pdf?sfvrsn=14) \n\n\n\n\n More information can also be found in the configuration guide:\n \n\n\n\n[http://www.opwglobal.com/opw\\-fms/tech\\-support/manuals\\-how\\-to\\-videos/technical\\-manuals](http://www.opwglobal.com/opw-fms/tech-support/manuals-how-to-videos/technical-manuals) \n\n\n\n\n For additional assistance, users and distributors may call the technical service line at 877\\-OPW\\-TECH (877\\-679\\-8324\\). OPW has also dedicated an additional phone number specifically for addressing this issue: 312\\-244\\-0632\\. Users may also email\n [FMSOrders@DoverFS.com](mailto:FMSOrders@DoverFS.com) \n or contact their commercial district manager.\n \n\n\n\n NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n----------------------\n\n\n\n[MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE\\-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n An attacker may create an application user account to gain administrative privileges.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-12733](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12733) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
