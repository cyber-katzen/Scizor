EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\u200bCVSS v3 7.5\n\u200bATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n\u200bVendor: Hitachi Energy\n\u200bEquipment: RTU500 series\n\u200bVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\n\u200bSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a buffer overflow and reboot of the product.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\u200bHitachi Energy reports these vulnerabilities affect the following RTU500 series products:\n\n\u200bRTU500 series CMU: Firmware versions 13.3.1\u201313.3.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\u200bA vulnerability exists in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function included in certain versions of the RTU500 series product. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the HCI 60870-5-104 is configured with IEC 62351-5 support and the CMU contains the license feature \u2018Advanced security\u2019 which must be ordered separately. If these preconditions are fulfilled, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the RTU500, causing the targeted RTU500 CMU to reboot. The vulnerability is caused by a missing input data validation, which eventually, if exploited, could cause an internal buffer to overflow in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function.\n\u200bCVE-2022-2502 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2 \u200b STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\u200bA vulnerability exists in HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function included in certain versions of the RTU500 series product. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the HCI 60870-5-104 is configured with support for IEC 62351-3. After session resumption interval is expired, an RTU500 initiated update of session parameters could cause an unexpected restart due to a stack overflow.\n\u200bCVE-2022-4608 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\u200bCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\n\u200bCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u200bCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\n\u200bHitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\n\u200bHitachi Energy recommends users update to CMU Firmware versions 13.3.3 or 13.4.1.\n\u200bThe reported vulnerabilities affect only the RTU500 series with HCI IEC 60870-5-104 and IEC62351-5 or IEC 62351-5 configured and enabled. A possible mitigation is to disable the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function or its IEC 62351-3 and IEC 62351-5 features if they are not used. By default, the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 and its IEC 62351-3 or IEC 62351-5 support are disabled.\n\u200bHitachi Energy recommends the following general mitigations:\n\n\u200bRecommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network.\n\u200bPhysically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\n\u200bEnsure process control systems have no direct connections to the internet and are separated from other networks via a firewall system with minimal exposed ports.\n\u200bDo not use process control systems for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.\n\u200bScan portable computers and removable storage media for malware prior connection to a control system.\n\u200bEnforce proper password policies and processes.\n\n\u200bFor more information, see Hitachi Energy\u2019s Security Advisory: 8DBD000121.\n\u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\u200bCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\n\u200bAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\u200bOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\u200bNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\n",
