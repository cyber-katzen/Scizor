CIMPLICITY 9.5 removed the drivers from the product.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 3 ----------\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the device that the attacker is accessing to crash; a buffer overflow condition may allow arbitrary remote code execution.\nMITIGATION\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 --------\nGE has released CIMPLICITY software Version 9.5 and they recommend that users update to that version or the latest version. The Series 90 TCP/IP communications support has been deprecated and users are encouraged to use the \u201cconvert to triplex\u201d application tool, which has been available since CIMPLICITY Version 6.1, to obtain communication support if needed. Documentation and information on procedures, as well as the upgrade to Version 9.5, can be located at the following location (login required):\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/CC_Contact\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 3 --------\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\nA function reads a packet to indicate the next packet length. The next packet length is not verified, allowing a buffer overwrite that could lead to an arbitrary remote code execution.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nCVE-2017-12732 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nRESEARCHER\nDavid Atch of CyberX reported the vulnerability to ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Boston, Massachusetts\n",
