EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Teamcenter* **Vulnerabilities:**  Command Injection, Infinite Loop2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to command injection and denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Teamcenter, a product lifecycle management software, are affected:* Teamcenter v12\\.4: All versions prior to v12\\.4\\.0\\.15* Teamcenter v13\\.0: All versions prior to v13\\.0\\.0\\.10* Teamcenter v13\\.1: All versions prior to v13\\.1\\.0\\.10* Teamcenter v13\\.2: All versions prior to v13\\.2\\.0\\.9* Teamcenter v13\\.3: All versions prior to v13\\.3\\.0\\.5* Teamcenter v14\\.0: All versions prior to v14\\.0\\.0\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND (\u2019COMMAND INJECTION\u2019) CWE\\-77](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html) The affected product is vulnerable to command injection, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2022\\-34660](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34660)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE\\-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html) The affected product is vulnerable to an attack that causes the product to enter an infinite loop and use CPU cycles. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-34661](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34661)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Han Lee from Apple Information Security reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Harden the application\u2019s host to prevent local access by untrusted or unauthorized personnel.* Limit access to port 4544/tcp to known, trusted IP addresses with a firewall. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-759952](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-759952.pdf)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
