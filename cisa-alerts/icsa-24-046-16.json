EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: FactoryTalk Service Platform\nVulnerability: Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow malicious users with basic user group privileges to receive administrator group privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports that the following versions of FactoryTalk Service Platform are affected:\n\nFactoryTalk Service Platform: versions prior to v2.74\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions CWE-279\nA privilege escalation vulnerability exists in FactoryTalk\u00ae Service Platform (FTSP). If exploited, a malicious user with basic user group privileges could potentially sign into the software and receive FTSP Administrator Group privileges. A threat actor could potentially read and modify sensitive data, delete data and render the FTSP system unavailable.\nCVE-2024-21915\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation encourages users with the affected software to apply the risk mitigations, if possible. Additionally, they encourage customers to implement\u00a0Rockwell Automation suggested security best practices\u00a0to minimize the risk of vulnerability.\nFor more information about this issue, please see\u00a0the advisory on the Rockwell Automation security page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
