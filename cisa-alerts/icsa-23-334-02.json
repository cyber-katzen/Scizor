EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Yokogawa\nEquipment: STARDOM FCN/FCJ\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition to the FCN/FCJ controller by sending a specially crafted packet.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Yokogawa STARDOM FCN/FCJ, a network control system, are affected:\n\nSTARDOM FCN/FCJ: versions R1.01 through R4.31\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nThis vulnerability may allow to a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition to the FCN/FCJ controller by sending a crafted packet. While sending the packet, the maintenance homepage of the controller could not be accessed. Therefore, functions of the maintenance homepage, changing configuration, viewing logs, etc. are not available. But the controller's operation is not stopped by the condition.\nCVE-2023-5915\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRoman Ezhov of Kaspersky reported this vulnerability to Yokogawa.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nYokogawa has released the following mitigations for users to implement:\n\nBy using the packet filter function* of the FCN/FCJ controller, only allow connection from trusted hosts.\nTake measures against the network so that an attacker cannot send a malicious packet.\n\nYokogawa strongly recommends all users to establish and maintain a full security program, not only for the vulnerability identified in this YSAR. Security program components are: Patch updates, Anti-virus, Backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewall, etc. Yokogawa can assist in setting up and running the security program continuously. For considering the most effective risk mitigation plan, as a starting point, Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment.\n*Revision up FCN/FCJ basic software to R4.20 or later for using the function.\nMore details can also be found in Yokogawa's security advisory report number\u00a0YSAR-23-0003.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
