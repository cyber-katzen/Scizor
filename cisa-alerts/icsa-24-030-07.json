MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommend users using the affected software to apply the risk mitigations, if possible:\n\nUpgrade to\u00a0CODESYS version 3.5.19.2\u00a0which has been released to mitigate these issues.\nAdditionally, we encourage the user to implement our suggested\u00a0security best practices\u00a0to minimize risk of the vulnerability.\n\nUsers can use\u00a0Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization\u00a0to generate more environment-specific prioritization.\nAdditional information can be found in the\u00a0CODESYS Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
