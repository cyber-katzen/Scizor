If an adversary issues a PROGRAM AREA WRITE command to a specific memory region, they could overwrite the password. This may lead to disabling UM protections or setting a non-ASCII password (non-keyboard characters) and preventing an engineer from viewing or modifying the user program.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0811\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSam Hanson of Dragos reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOMRON has released the following countermeasures for users to implement:\u00a0\n\nEnable the hardware switch to prohibit writing UM (DIP switch on front panel of the CPU Unit)\u00a0\nSet UM read protection password and \u201cProhibit from overwriting to a protected program \u201coption.\u00a0\n\nIf the countermeasures cannot be applied, OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures:\u00a0\nSecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access:\u00a0\n\nIf the following products and versions are used, the risk of attacks by an attacker via the network can be reduced by taking the following measures.\u00a0\n\nEnable the FINS write protection function.\u00a0\nSelect the Protect by IP Address\u00a0\n\n\nMinimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that untrusted devices will be unable to access them. \u00a0\nImplement firewalls (by shutting down unused communications ports, limiting communications hosts, limiting access to FINS port (9600)) and isolate them from the IT network.\u00a0\nUse a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.\u00a0\nUse strong passwords and change them frequently.\u00a0\nInstall physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems and equipment.\u00a0\nScan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them to systems and devices.\u00a0\nEnforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems and equipment whenever possible.\u00a0\nAnti-virus protection\u00a0\n\nProtect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation and maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.\u00a0\n\n\nData input and output protection\u00a0\n\nValidation processing such as backup and range check to cope with unintentional modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.\u00a0\n\n\nData recovery\u00a0\n\nPeriodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor more information, see Omron\u2019s Security Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
