[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryGE Healthcare Imaging and Ultrasound Products============================================= Last Revised December 08, 2020 Alert Code ICSMA\\-20\\-343\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  GE Healthcare* **Equipment:**  GE Imaging and Ultrasound Products* **Vulnerabilities:**  Unprotected Transport of Credentials, Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could occur if an attacker gains access to the healthcare delivery organization\u2019s (HDO) network. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain access to affected devices in a way that is comparable with GE (remote) service user privileges. A successful exploitation could expose sensitive data such as a limited set of patient health information (PHI) or could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code, which might impact the availability of the system and allow manipulation of PHI.3\\.

MITIGATIONS--------------- GE has identified mitigations for specific products and releases and will take proactive measures to ensure proper configuration of the product firewall protection and change default passwords on impacted devices where possible. GE recommends users refer to the G [E Healthcare Product Security Portal](https://www.gehealthcare.com/en-US/security)  for more details on mitigations and how proactive actions may apply to affected devices. In addition to the product specific recommendations, GE recommends utilizing clinical network security best practices. Suggested clinical best practices include:* Ensure proper segmentation of the local hospital/clinical network and create explicit access rules based on source/destination IP/port for all connections, including those used for remote support. Specific ports to consider may include those used for TELNET, FTP, REXEC, and SSH* Utilize IPSec VPN and explicit access rules at the Internet edge before forwarding incoming connections to the local hospital/clinical network. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
