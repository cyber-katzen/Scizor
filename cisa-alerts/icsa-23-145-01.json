EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Moxa* **Equipment:**  MXsecurity Series* **Vulnerabilities:**  Command Injection and Use of Hard\\-Coded Credentials2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized user to bypass authentication or to execute arbitrary commands on the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Moxa reports these vulnerabilities affect the following MXsecurity Series:* MXsecurity Series: Software v1\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [COMMAND INJECTION CWE\\-77](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)** A remote attacker, who has gained authorization privileges, could execute arbitrary commands on the device.[CVE\\-2023\\-33235](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33235)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)** An attacker could bypass authentication for web\\-based application programmable interfaces (APIs).[CVE\\-2023\\-33236](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-33236)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Simon Janz, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Moxa has developed a solution to address these vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to [software v1\\.0\\.1 or higher](https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-network-infrastructure/network-management-software/mxsecurity-series?viewmode=0#resources)  . Users are encouraged to visit Moxa\u2019s security advisory [MPSA\\-230301](https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/security-advisory/mxsecurity-command-injection-and-hardcoded-credential-vulnerabilities)  for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.
