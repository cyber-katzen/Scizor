EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: MicroLogix 1100/1400\nVulnerability: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to trick a legitimate user into using an untrusted website. If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to a loss of sensitive information, such as authentication credentials.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following MicroLogix controllers:\u00a0\n\nMicroLogix 1400: Versions 21.007 and prior\nMicroLogix 1100: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021\nThe X-Frame-Options header is not configured in the HTTP response, which could allow clickjacking attacks.\nCVE-2022-2179 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPawan V. Sable and Pranita Binnar from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation encourages those using the affected software to implement the mitigations below to minimize risk. Additionally, Rockwell Automation encourages users to combine risk mitigations with security best practices (also provided below) to deploy a defense-in-depth strategy.\n\nDisable the web server where possible (this component is an optional feature and disabling it will not disrupt the intended use of the device).\nConfigure firewalls to disallow network communication through HTTP/Port 80\n\nIf applying the mitigations noted above are not possible, please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s Knowledgebase article QA43240 Security Best Practices.\nFor more information, please see the industrial security advisory from Rockwell Automation.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
