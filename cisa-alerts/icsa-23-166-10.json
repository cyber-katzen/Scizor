A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe iconv feature in the GNU C library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.\nCVE-2019-25013 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nA use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.\nCVE-2020-1752 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.0 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe GNU C library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.\nCVE-2020-10029 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated.

This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.\nCVE-2021-35942 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.15\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nIn librt in the GNU C library (aka glibc) through 2.34, sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/mq_notify.c mishandles certain NOTIFY_REMOVED data, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

MITIGATIONS\nSiemens is preparing updates and recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nOnly build and run applications from trusted sources.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT: https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories.\u00a0\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-831302 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\n",
