A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The iconv feature in the GNU C library (aka glibc or libc6\\) through 2\\.32, when processing invalid multi\\-byte input sequences in the EUC\\-KR encoding, may have a buffer over\\-read.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2019\\-25013](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-25013) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A use\\-after\\-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2\\.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2\\.32\\.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-1752](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1752) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl\\-96/e\\_rem\\_pio2l.c.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-10029](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10029) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

An off\\-by\\-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1\\. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-3999](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3999) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens is preparing updates and recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:\n \n\n\n* Only build and run applications from trusted sources.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\n <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>\n .\n \n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT:\n <https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>\n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-831302 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-831302.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-831302.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\n* Refer to\n [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) \n for more information on avoiding email scams.\n* Refer to\n [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) \n for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
