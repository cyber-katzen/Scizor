MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens is preparing updates and recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:* Only build and run applications from trusted sources. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> .
