Network Vision has produced a new version that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following IntraVue software versions are affected:\n\nIntraVue, all Windows versions prior to Version 2.3.0a14.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an affected server.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nNetwork Vision is a US-based company headquartered in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\nThe affected product, IntraVue, is a software package for network visualization. According to Network Vision, IntraVue is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Network Vision estimates that these products are used globally with a significant portion in North America and Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nOS COMMAND INJECTIONCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html, web site last accessed February 26, 2015.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary operating system commands on an affected server system.\nCVE-2015-0977NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0977, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed February 26, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nNetwork Vision has released a new version of the IntraVues software that mitigates the code injection vulnerability. It is recommended that the new version be applied as soon as possible. Users who have software support contracts with Network Vision can upgrade to the newest version at no cost. For more information, please contact Network Vision:\nToll Free (US): (877) 499-8100\nPhone: (978) 499-7800\nEmail: help@intravue.net\nAdditional mitigations could be implemented as interim prevention measures until the new version is applied. The following mitigations could be used to help limit the impact of the code injection vulnerability; however, the following suggestions may not be appropriate for all environments. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nIsolate the vulnerable system from the Internet and untrusted systems; however, if connectivity is required, use a VPN solution and implement network monitoring.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nImplement a runtime policy to prevent the use of any command that does not appear in a whitelist of allowable commands.\nUtilize good design practices that include network segmentation; use of DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic; and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems.\nIf possible, create isolated accounts using lowest privileges to accomplish minimum required tasks.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
