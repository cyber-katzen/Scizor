EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: GOT2000 series and GT SoftGOT2000\nVulnerability: Missing Synchronization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMitsubishi Electric reports this vulnerability affects the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function of following products:\n\nGOT2000 models GT27, GT25, GT23: All communication driver versions between 01.19.000 and 01.39.010. These versions are affected when using the \u201cMODBUS/TCP Slave, Gateway\u201d communication driver.\nGT SoftGOT2000: All versions between 1.170C and 1.256S. These versions are affected when configured to use \u201cMODBUS/TCP Slave\u201d communication.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING SYNCHRONIZATION CWE-820\nA malicious attacker can stop the communication function of products by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting to and from the MODBUS/TCP communication port on GOT, which may cause a denial-of-service condition. Restart of hardware and software is required to recover.\nCVE-2021-20592 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nParul Sindhwad and Dr. Faruk Kazi of COE-CNDS Lab, VJTI reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users upgrade to the following versions:\n\nGOT2000 models GT27, GT25, GT23: Update communication driver to version 01.40.000 or later (Fixed communication driver is included in GT Designer3 Version1(GOT2000) Version 1.260W or later)\nGT SoftGOT2000: Update to Version 1.26W or later\n\nFor specific update instructions and additional details see the Mitsubishi Electric advisory.\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigations to minimize the risk of this vulnerability:\n\nWhen connecting the products to the Internet, use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access.\nUse the products within the LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.\nInstall antivirus software on your computer that can access the product.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
