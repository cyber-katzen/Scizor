EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Emerson\nEquipment: OpenBSI\nVulnerabilities: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\nCISA is aware of a public report, \u201cOT:ICEFALL,\u201d that details vulnerabilities found in multiple operational technology (OT) vendors. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide notice of reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations to reduce risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause remote code execution, change controller configuration, or cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of OpenBSI, a set of network communication services, are affected:\n\nOpenBSI: Versions 5.9 SP3 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327\nThe affected product was found to store credentials in an insecure local file. This could allow an attacker with local access to the system to compromise these stored credentials.\nCVE-2022-29959 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nThe affected product was found to have hardcoded cryptographic keys, which could allow an attacker with local access to the filesystem to elevate their privileges.\nCVE-2022-29960 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Chemical, Life Sciences, Water and Wastewater\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDaniel dos Santos and Jos Wetzels from Forescout Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFor CVE-2022-29959, Emerson recommends not using the OpenBSI \"User Management Tool\" to manage RTU credentials; this utility is no longer supported and will be removed from future versions. To remove the OpenBSI \u201cUser Management Tool\u201d from a current installation, Emerson recommends users:\n\nTake backups of the information from the SecUsers.ini file securely if the tool has already been used.\nDelete the SecUser.ini file.\nDelete the UserMngtTool.exe executable from the OpenBSI folder.\n\nCVE-2022-29960\u2014DES (Data Encryption Standard) with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used to protect system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDevices running OpenBSI and RTUs should never be exposed to the internet. Users should also ensure network security; see OpenBSI Utilities Manual D301414x012 Section 6.1 Configuring OpenBSI Security.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
