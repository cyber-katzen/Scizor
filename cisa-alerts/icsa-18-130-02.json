TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Arena, simulation software for manufacturing, are affected:* Arena versions 15\\.10\\.00 and prior.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) A use after free vulnerability caused by processing specially crafted Arena Simulation Software files may cause the software application to crash, potentially losing any unsaved data.[CVE\\-2018\\-8843](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8843)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Critical Manufacturing* **Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location:**  Wisconsin, USA### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Ariele Caltabiano, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation encourages affected users to upgrade to the latest version of Arena software, v15\\.10\\.01 or later, which can be obtained from (login required):<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073588> NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.
