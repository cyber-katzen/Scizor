[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryEcava IntegraXor================ Last Revised December 19, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-353\\-03### **CVSS v3 5\\.3****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Ecava**Equipment:**  IntegraXor**Vulnerabilities:**  SQL InjectionAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following version of IntegraXor, a web SCADA/HMI solution, is affected:* Ecava IntegraXor v 6\\.1\\.1030\\.1 and prior.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the database or generate an error in the database log.MITIGATION---------- Ecava recommends that users of affected IntegraXor versions update to version 6\\.1\\.1215\\.0 or newer, a download for which can be found at the following location:[https://www.integraxor.com/download\\-scada/](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.integraxor.com_download-2Dscada_&d=DwMFaQ&c=54IZrppPQZKX9mLzcGdPfFD1hxrcB__aEkJFOKJFd00&r=zE5lG3CZZIbdBvT6slVAzQ&m=Vig9iCGIdkliZHkU6BzskOnIx5BXik_qNrue1_PQnaw&s=9SyDEenHd_4H1mOZRw4RAOxfNInG0cETw6b3WCKnrPI&e=)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The SQL Injection vulnerability has been identified, which attacker can leverage to disclose sensitive information from the database.[CVE\\-2017\\-16733](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-16733)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
