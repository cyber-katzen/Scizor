EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Honeywell\nEquipment: NOTI-FIRE-NET Web Server (NWS-3)\nVulnerabilities: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay, Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker bypassing web server authentication methods.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Notifier Web Server (NWS) are affected:\n\nVersion 3.50 and earlier\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\nThe Honeywell Fire Web Server\u2019s authentication may be bypassed by a capture-replay attack from a web browser.\nCVE-2020-6972 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, which allows an attacker to bypass access to restricted directories.\nCVE-2020-6974 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR: Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nGjoko Krstikj reported these vulnerabilities to Honeywell.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHoneywell has released a firmware update package (login required) for all affected products listed above.\u00a0\nFor additional details please see Honeywell Security Notification SN 2020-02-04 01\nHoneywell recommends users with affected products take the following steps to protect themselves:\n\nUpdate NWS-3 firmware per the security notification.\nIsolate system from the Internet or create additional layers of defense by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ.\nIf remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located.\nAlways use strong passwords on installations to prevent unauthorized access\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
