EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Inductive Automation\nEquipment: Ignition\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-147-01 Inductive Automation Ignition (Update A) that was published June 2, 2020, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3.\u00a0RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information and perform remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Inductive Automation Ignition are affected:\n\nInductive Automation Ignition 7 Gateway versions prior to 7.9.14\nInductive Automation Ignition 8 Gateway versions prior to 8.0.10\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected product lacks proper authentication required to query the server.\nCVE-2020-12004 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data.\nCVE-2020-10644 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nThe affected product is vulnerable to the handling of serialized data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data.\nCVE-2020-12000 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nSensitive information can be obtained through the handling of serialized data. The issue results from the lack of proper authentication required to query the server.\nCVE-2020-14479 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nPedro Ribeiro, Radek Domanski, Chris Anastasio (muffin), and Steven Seeley (mr_me) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nInductive Automation recommends upgrading the Ignition software to v8.0.10\nFor those running v7.9.x, it is recommended to upgrade the Ignition software to v7.9.14\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nPlease note CVE-2020-14479 does not have a fix in place. Induction Automation plans to correct this vulnerability in future product versions.\nIt is recommended to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only clients and servers with a legitimate procedural relationship should be permitted to communicate with the service. This can be done in various ways, most notably with firewall rules/allow listing.\nFor more information regarding software and patches, please refer to the specified version in Inductive Automation\u2019s release notes.\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
