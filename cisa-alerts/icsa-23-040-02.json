Ltd\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0XBC-DN32U\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Improper Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) information, cause users to lose communication with the PLC, modify PLC code, obtain credentials, and create a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of XBC-DN32U, a PLC performance module, is affected:\u00a0\n\nXBC-DN32U: Operating System Version 01.80\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 is missing authentication to perform critical functions to the PLC. This could allow an attacker to change the PLC's mode arbitrarily.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22803\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 is missing authentication to create users on the PLC. This could allow an attacker to create and use an account with elevated privileges and take control of the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22804\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 has improper access control to its read prohibition feature. This could allow a remote attacker to remotely set the feature to lock users out of reading data from the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22805\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 transmits sensitive information in cleartext when communicating over its XGT protocol. This could allow an attacker to gain sensitive information, such as user credentials.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22806\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 does not properly control access to the PLC over its internal XGT protocol. An attacker could control and tamper with the PLC by sending packets to the PLC over its XGT protocol.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-22807\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\u00a0\nLS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 is missing authentication for its deletion command. This could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0102\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0ACCESS OF MEMORY LOCATION AFTER END OF BUFFER CWE-788\u00a0\nIf an attacker were to access memory locations of LS ELECTRIC XBC-DN32U with operating system version 01.80 outside of the communication buffer, the device could stop operating. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0103\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0South Korea\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHeeA Go, JinYoung Kim, JeongHoon Bae, HyeokJong Yun and YiJoon Jung of the hellOT team reported CVE-2023-22803 and CVE-2023-22804 to CISA. HeeA Go of Dankook University reported CVE-2023-22805, CVE-2023-22806, CVE-2023-22807, CVE-2023-0102, CVE-2023-0103 to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nLS ELECTRIC is developing mitigations (to be released tentatively by the end of 2023) and recommends users follow the provided workarounds to reduce the risk of exploitation:\u00a0\n\nRestrict communication to the PLC to only trusted IP addresses and trusted devices by enabling the \u201cHost Table\u201d option in the configuration window of the PLC.\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0\n",
