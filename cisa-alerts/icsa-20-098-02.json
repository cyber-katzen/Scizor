MITIGATIONS--------------- GE Digital CIMPLICITY v11\\.0, released January 2020, contains mitigation for this local privilege escalation vulnerability. GE Digital recommends all users upgrade to GE CIMPLICITY v11\\.0 or newer. Other recommendations may mitigate issues, but only installing the most current version will fully address the issue. To obtain the latest version of this product, please contact a [GE Digital representative](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/CC_Contact)  . GE Digital provides guidance for users to secure systems, and advises that users running CIMPLICITY adhere to the Secure Deployment Guide found on [GE Digital\u2019s customer center](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Documentation/CIMPLICITY-Secure-Deployment-Guide2)  (requires logon). CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Exercise principles of least privilege.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
