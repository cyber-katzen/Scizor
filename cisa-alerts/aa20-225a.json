System owners and administrators should review any configuration change prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.* Include warning banners for all emails external to the organization.* Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. See [Protecting Against Malicious Code](/news-events/news/protecting-against-malicious-code)  .* Ensure systems have the latest security updates. See [Understanding Patches and Software Updates](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006)  .* Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.* Restrict users' permissions to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators\u2019 group unless required.* Enforce a strong password policy. See [Choosing and Protecting Passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002)  .* Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. See [Using Caution with Email Attachments](/news-events/news/using-caution-email-attachments)  .* Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations that is configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.* Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.* Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).* Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.* Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).* Scan all software downloaded from the internet prior to executing.* Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
