RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, control of the robot, and a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMiR reports the vulnerabilities affect the following products:\u00a0\n\nMiR100, MiR200, MiR250, MiR500, MiR1000 in MiR Robot Software versions prior to 2.10.2.1\nMiR Fleet in MiR Fleet Software versions prior to 2.10.2.1\u00a0\n\nNOTE: the MiR Hook and Shelf Carrier are not affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nAn authenticated local attacker with an account on the MiR robot operating system can exploit a Linux kernel vulnerability to perform privilege escalation to root or cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2017-7184 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190\nA handler in the Linux kernel prior to Version 4.11 allows local users to cause a denial-of-service condition or other unspecified impact(s) via use of a large value.\nCVE-2017-18255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nTwo APIs to the Robot Operating System (ROS) used in MiR robots were accessible from both wired and wireless network interfaces. Using these APIs, an attacker could take control of the robot, cause a denial-of-service condition, and exfiltrate data over the web interface.\nCVE-2020-10271 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nRobot Operating System (ROS) default packages are used, which expose the computational graph without any authentication. This could allow an attacker with access to the internal wireless and wired networks to take control of the robot.\nCVE-2020-10272 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nAn attacker with physical access to the hard drive, or an attacker with a local account on the robot operating system could extract sensitive data.\nCVE-2020-10273 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nMiR robots shipped before June 2020 had default passwords set for the SICK safety PLC. An attacker with access to the internal network of the robot could use the default credentials to manipulate the safety PLC, effectively disabling the emergency stop function.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-10276 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nMiR robots ship with the option to boot from a connected USB drive. The ability to boot from USB is an insecure default configuration that is changeable by integrators. Integrators are informed and instructed in writing to evaluate disabling USB boot. If left enabled, an attacker with physical access to the robot could abuse this functionality to manipulate or exfiltrate data stored on the robot\u2019s hard drive.\nCVE-2020-10277 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe lack of a BIOS password is an insecure default configuration, changeable by integrators. Integrators are informed and instructed in writing to evaluate BIOS protection.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-10278 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nMiR software versions prior to v2.8.3 contain system configurations with insecure defaults, allowing an authorized local attacker with access to the robot operating system (ROS) to perform privilege escalation or cause denial-of-service.\nCVE-2020-10279 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0FAILURE TO HANDLE INCOMPLETE ELEMENT CWE-239\nThe Apache server on Port 80 hosting the web interface is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition when an attacker spams incomplete HTTP headers, effectively blocking the access to the dashboard.\nCVE-2020-10280 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Denmark\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVictor Mayoral Vilches of Alias Robotics reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMiR recommends users upgrade affected products to the latest version. New software versions can be found on the MiR Distributor portal (login required).\nFor more information, refer to MiR\u2019s security advisories page.\nMiR instructs customers to explicitly change default credentials upon configuring the robots, including default SSID and password to the WiFi access point.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
