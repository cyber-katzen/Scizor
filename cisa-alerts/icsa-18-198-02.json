EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.0\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/Low skill level to exploit/Public exploits are available\nVendor: WAGO\nEquipment: e!DISPLAY Web-Based-Management (WBM)\nVulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, and Incorrect Permissions for Critical Resource\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the user, execute code within the user\u2019s browser, place malicious files within the filesystem, and replace existing files to allow privilege escalation.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of WAGO e!DISPLAY, an HMI, running firmware FW 01 are affected:\n\n762-3000,\n762-3001,\n762-3002, and\n762-3003\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nAuthenticated and unauthenticated users can send specially crafted requests to the web server, which allows code injection within the WBM. The code will be rendered and/or executed within the user\u2019s browser.\nCVE-2018-12981 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThis vulnerability allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the file system with the permissions of the web server.CVE-2018-12980 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nWeak permissions allow an authenticated user to overwrite critical files by abusing the unrestricted file upload in the WBM.CVE-2018-12979 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nT. Weber of SEC Consult reported these vulnerabilities to CERT@VDE, who reported them to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWAGO recommends affected users update to the latest firmware (FW 02). Contact WAGO support for update files and specific instructions.\nWAGO also recommends the following mitigations:\n\nUpdate the device to the latest firmware.\nRestrict network access to the device.\nDo not directly connect the device to the Internet.\nRestrict the number of users with access to the device to a minimum.\nChange the default passwords of devices.\nDo not install software from untrusted sources.\nDo not open websites or follow links from untrusted sources.\n\nWAGO has published a security advisory that can be viewed here:\nhttps://www.wago.com/medias/SA-WBM-2018-004.pdf\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
