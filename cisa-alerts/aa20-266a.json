See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/) \n frameworks for all referenced threat actor techniques.* \n\n\n\n\n This product was written by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with contributions by the\n [Multi\\-State Information Sharing \\& Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC)](https://www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA has observed a notable increase in the use of LokiBot malware by malicious cyber actors since July 2020\\. Throughout this period, CISA\u2019s EINSTEIN Intrusion Detection System, which protects federal, civilian executive branch networks, has detected persistent malicious LokiBot activity. LokiBot uses a credential\\- and information\\-stealing malware, often sent as a malicious attachment and known for being simple, yet effective, making it an attractive tool for a broad range of cyber actors across a wide variety of data compromise use cases.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n LokiBot\u2014also known as Lokibot, Loki PWS, and Loki\\-bot\u2014employs Trojan malware to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other credentials.\n \n\n\n* The malware steals credentials through the use of a keylogger to monitor browser and desktop activity (\n *Credentials from Password Stores* \n \\[\n [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1555/) \n ]).\n\t+ (\n\t *Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers* \n\t \\[\n\t [T1555\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1555/003) \n\t ])\n\t+ (\n\t *Input Capture: Keylogging* \n\t \\[\n\t [T1056\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/001) \n\t ])\n* LokiBot can also create a backdoor into infected systems to allow an attacker to install additional payloads (\n *Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features* \n \\[\n [T1546\\.008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1546/008/) \n ]).\n* Malicious cyber actors typically use LokiBot to target Windows and Android operating systems and distribute the malware via email, malicious websites, text, and other private messages (\n *User Execution: Malicious File* \n \\[\n [T1204\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/002/) \n ]). See figure 1 for enterprise techniques used by LokiBot.\n\n\n\n![]()\n \u200b\n \n\n\n\n*Figure 1: MITRE ATT\\&CK enterprise techniques used by LokiBot* \n\n\n\n\n Since LokiBot was first reported in 2015, cyber actors have used it across a range of targeted applications, including the following.\n \n\n\n* **February 2020:** \n Trend Micro identified cyber actors using LokiBot to impersonate a launcher for Fortnite\u2014a popular video game.\\[\n [1](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/lokibot-impersonates-popular-game-launcher-and-drops-compiled-c-code-file/) \n ]\n* **August 2019:** \n FortiGuard SE researchers discovered a malspam campaign distributing LokiBot information\\-stealing payloads in spearphishing attack on a U.S. manufacturing company.\\[\n

\n ]\n* **August 2019:** \n Trend Micro researchers reported LokiBot malware source code being hidden in image files spread as attachments in phishing emails.\\[\n [3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lokibot-information-stealer-now-hides-malware-in-image-files/) \n ]\n* **June 2019:** \n Netskope uncovered LokiBot being distributed in a malspam campaign using ISO image file attachments.\\[\n [4](https://www.securityweek.com/lokibot-and-nanocore-malware-distributed-iso-image-files) \n ]\n* **April 2019:** \n Netskope uncovered a phishing campaign using malicious email attachments with LokiBot malware to create backdoors onto infected Windows systems and steal sensitive information.\\[\n [5](https://www.netskope.com/blog/lokibot-nanocore-iso-disk-image-files) \n ]\n* **February 2018:** \n Trend Micro discovered CVE\\-2017\\-11882 being exploited in an attack using Windows Installer service to deliver LokiBot malware.\\[\n [6](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/b/attack-using-windows-installer-msiexec-exe-leads-lokibot.html) \n ]\n* **October 2017:** \n SfyLabs identified cyber actors using LokiBot as an Android banking trojan that turns into ransomware.\\[\n [7](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lokibot-android-banking-trojan-turns-into-ransomware-when-you-try-to-remove-it/) \n ]\n* **May 2017:** \n Fortinet reported malicious actors using a PDF file to spread a new LokiBot variant capable of stealing credentials from more than 100 different software tools.\\[\n [8](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-loki-variant-being-spread-via-pdf-file) \n ]\n* **March 2017:** \n Check Point discovered LokiBot malware found pre\\-installed on Android devices.\\[\n [9](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/03/10/preinstalled-malware-targeting-mobile-users/) \n ]\n* **December 2016:** \n Dr.Web researchers identified a new LokiBot variant targeting Android core libraries.\\[\n [10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/loki-trojan-infects-android-libraries-and-system-process-to-get-root-privileges/) \n ]\n* **February 2016:** \n Researchers discovered the LokiBot Android Trojan infecting the core Android operating system processes.\\[\n [11](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/android-malware-variants/lokibot) \n ]\n\n\n### MITRE ATT\\&CK Techniques\n\n\n\n According to MITRE,\n

territorial government, private sector users, and network administrators consider applying the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n \n\n\n* Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. See\n [Protecting Against Malicious Code](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST18-271) \n .\n* Keep operating system patches up to date. See\n [Understanding Patches and Software Updates](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006) \n .\n* Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use\n [strong passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) \n or Active Directory authentication.\n* Enforce multi\\-factor authentication. See\n [Supplementing Passwords](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012) \n for more information.\n* Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators\u2019 group unless required.\n* Enforce a strong password policy. See\n [Choosing and Protecting Passwords](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) \n .\n* Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
