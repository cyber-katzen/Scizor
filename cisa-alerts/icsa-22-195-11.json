RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a user to open a malicious DWG file that could lead to the application crashing or to an arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Drawing SDK, a professional SDK platform, are affected:\n\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28807): All versions prior to 2023.2\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28808): All versions prior to 2023.3\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28809): All versions prior to 2023.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nOpen Design Alliance Drawings SDK is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to rendering of .DWG files after they are opened in the recovery mode. This allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-28807 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nOpen Design Alliance Drawings SDK is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to reading .DWG files in the recovery mode. This allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-28808 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nOpen Design Alliance Drawings SDK is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to reading .DWG files with invalid vertex number in the recovery mode. This allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-28809 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOpen Design Alliance recommends the following:\n\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28807): Update to version 2023.2 or later\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28808): Update to version 2023.3 or later\nDrawing SDK (CVE-2022-28809): Update to version 2023.3 or later\n\nFor additional information, please refer to Open Design Alliance Security Advisories.\nSee the following links for more information and mitigations on ICS devices that use Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK:\n\nSiemens Security Advisory SSA-429204\n\n\u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
