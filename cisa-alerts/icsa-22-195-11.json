EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Open Design Alliance* **Equipment:**  Drawings SDK* **Vulnerability:**  Out\\-of\\-Bounds Read2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a user to open a malicious DWG file that could lead to the application crashing or to an arbitrary code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Drawing SDK, a professional SDK platform, are affected:* Drawing SDK (CVE\\-2022\\-28807\\): All versions prior to 2023\\.2* Drawing SDK (CVE\\-2022\\-28808\\): All versions prior to 2023\\.3* Drawing SDK (CVE\\-2022\\-28809\\): All versions prior to 2023\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK is vulnerable to an out\\-of\\-bounds read due to rendering of .DWG files after they are opened in the recovery mode. This allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-28807](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-28807)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK is vulnerable to an out\\-of\\-bounds read due to reading .DWG files in the recovery mode. This allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-28808](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-28808)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
