EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: HID Global\nEquipment: Reader Configuration Cards\nVulnerability: Improper Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read the credential and device administration keys from a configuration card. Those keys could be used to create malicious configuration cards or credentials.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following HID products are affected:\n\nHID iCLASS SE reader configuration cards: All versions\nOMNIKEY Secure Elements reader configuration cards: All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nSensitive data can be extracted from HID iCLASS SE reader configuration cards. This could include credential and device administrator keys.\nCVE-2024-23806\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHID Global reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHID Global recommends the following mitigations to reduce the risk:\n\n\nElite Key and Custom Key customers that have kept their configuration cards secure should continue to be vigilant and restrict access to those cards. To exploit this vulnerability, a reader must be physically close to or in possession of the configuration cards to communicate with the card and extract information.\n\n\nAdministrators should plan to securely destroy unneeded configuration cards.\n\n\nCustomers using the HID standard key, and other customers who are concerned their keys may be compromised should consider steps to update the readers and credentials with new keys. To assist in this effort, HID will be introducing a free upgrade to the Elite Key program. Contact your HID representative for more information at\u00a0https://www.hidglobal.com/support.\n\n\nHID has also provided additional steps users can take steps to harden their readers to prevent malicious configuration changes.\niCLASS SE Readers\n\niCLASS SE Readers using firmware version 8.6.0.4 or higher can use the HID Reader Manager application to prevent the readers from accepting configuration changes from Configuration Cards.\n\tIf you need assistance, or if the reader firmware has not been updated to 8.6.0.4 or higher, contact HID Technical Support.\n\nHID OMNIKEY Readers, OMNIKEY Secure Elements, iCLASS SE Reader Modules, iCLASS SE Processors\n\nContact HID to receive a \"Shield Card\" that will prevent further configuration changes using reader configuration cards.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 6, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
