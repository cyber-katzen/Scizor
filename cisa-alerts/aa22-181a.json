These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of the Treasury, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are releasing this CSA to provide information on MedusaLocker ransomware. Observed as recently as May 2022, MedusaLocker actors predominantly rely on vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access victims\u2019 networks. The MedusaLocker actors encrypt the victim's data and leave a ransom note with communication instructions in every folder containing an encrypted file. The note directs victims to provide ransomware payments to a specific Bitcoin wallet address. MedusaLocker appears to operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model based on the observed split of ransom payments. Typical RaaS models involve the ransomware developer and various affiliates that deploy the ransomware on victim systems. MedusaLocker ransomware payments appear to be consistently split between the affiliate, who receives 55 to 60 percent of the ransom; and the developer, who receives the remainder.\u00a0\nDownload the PDF version of this report: pdf, 633 kb\n\nTechnical Details\n\nMedusaLocker ransomware actors most often gain access to victim devices through vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations [T1133]. Actors also frequently use email phishing and spam email campaigns\u2014directly attaching the ransomware to the email\u2014as initial intrusion vectors [T1566].\nMedusaLocker ransomware uses a batch file to execute PowerShell script invoke-ReflectivePEInjection [T1059.001]. This script propagates MedusaLocker throughout the network by editing the EnableLinkedConnections value within the infected machine\u2019s registry, which then allows the infected machine to detect attached hosts and networks via Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and to detect shared storage via Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol.\u00a0\nMedusaLocker then:\u00a0\n\nRestarts the LanmanWorkstation service, which allows registry edits to take effect.\u00a0\nKills the processes of well-known security, accounting, and forensic software.\u00a0\nRestarts the machine in safe mode to avoid detection by security software [T1562.009].\nEncrypts victim files with the AES-256 encryption algorithm; the resulting key is then encrypted with an RSA-2048 public key [T1486].\u00a0\nRuns every 60 seconds, encrypting all files except those critical to the functionality of the victim\u2019s machine and those that have the designated encrypted file extension.\u00a0\nEstablishes persistence by copying an executable (svhost.exe or svhostt.exe) to the %APPDATA%\\Roaming directory and scheduling a task to run the ransomware every 15 minutes.\u00a0\nAttempts to prevent standard recovery techniques by deleting local backups, disabling startup recovery options, and deleting shadow copies [T1490].\n\nMedusaLocker actors place a ransom note into every folder containing a file with the victim's encrypted data. The note outlines how to communicate with the MedusaLocker actors, typically providing victims one or more email address at which the actors can be reached. The size of MedusaLocker ransom demands appears to vary depending on the victim\u2019s financial status as perceived by the actors.\u00a0\n\u2003\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n\n\nEncrypted File

Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides.\nInstall, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.\nInstall updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as possible.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or unrecognized accounts.\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.\u00a0\nDisable unused ports.\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\nDisable hyperlinks in received emails.\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA).\nUse National Institute of\u00a0Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies:\n\nUse longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length.\nStore passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\nAdd password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\nAvoid reusing passwords.\nImplement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.\nDisable password \u201chints\u201d.\nRefrain from requiring password changes unless there is evidence of password compromise.\u00a0Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords and no longer require\u00a0regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\n\nOnly use secure networks; avoid using public Wi-Fi networks.\nConsider installing and using a virtual private network (VPN) to establish secure remote connections.\nFocus on cybersecurity awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, such as ransomware and phishing scams.\n\n\u00a0\nResources\n\nStopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\nResource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide\nNo-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment\n\nReporting\n\nTo report an incident and request technical assistance, contact CISA at Central@cisa.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870, or FBI through a local field office.\u00a0\nFinancial Institutions must ensure compliance with any applicable Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including suspicious activity reporting obligations.
