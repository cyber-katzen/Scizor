[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric SoMachine HVAC Unsafe ActiveX Control Vulnerability====================================================================== Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-196\\-03OVERVIEW-------- Andrea Micalizzi discovered an unsafe ActiveX control vulnerability in Schneider Electric\u2019s SoMachine software. He reported this vulnerability to ZDI who then reported it to NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT. Schneider Electric has produced a patch to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Schneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:* SoMachine HVAC\\-Application Version 2\\.0\\.2 and previous.IMPACT------ An exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Schneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and it maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide. The affected product, SoMachine, is software for developing, configuring, and commissioning a machine in a single software environment, including logic, motion control, HMI, and related network automation functions. According to Schneider Electric, SoMachine is deployed in the Commercial Facilities sector. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### UNSAFE ACTIVEX CONTROL MARKED SAFE\\-FOR\\-SCRIPTING CWE\\-623: Unsafe ActiveX Control Marked Safe For Scripting, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/623\\.html , web site last accessed July 14, 2016\\. An ActiveX control is intended for restricted use, but it has been marked as safe\\-for\\-scripting.

This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L , web site last accessed July 14, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- Schneider Electric has released a patch that resolves the vulnerability. Schneider Electric\u2019s patch is available at the following location:[http://www.schneider\\-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SoMachine%20HVAC%20\\-%20Programming%20Software%20for%20Modicon%20M171\\-M172%20Logic%20Controllers](http://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SoMachine%20HVAC%20-%20Programming%20Software%20for%20Modicon%20M171-M172%20Logic%20Controllers)  Schneider Electric\u2019s security notice SEVD\\-2016\\-161\\-01 is available at the following location:[http://download.schneider\\-electric.com/files?p\\_Doc\\_Ref\\=SEVD\\-2016\\-161\\-01](http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2016-161-01)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
