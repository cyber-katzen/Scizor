Exploits that target the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 --------\nThe following mGuard versions are affected:\n\nmGuard firmware Versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1\n\nmGuard firmware versions prior to 8.0.0 whether running on Innominate, Phoenix Contact, or other brands of devices are NOT affected.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 4 ----------\nIMPACT\nmGuard firmware Versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1 use the OpenSSL cryptographic library and transport layer security (TLS) implementation Version 1.0.1, which is known to be vulnerable to the HeartBleed vulnerability.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 4 --------\nInnominate is a German-based company that sells products worldwide through its international partners. Innominate was acquired by Phoenix Contact in 2008.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 4 ----------\nThe affected products, the mGuard family of products, are industrial security routers. They can be found in many critical infrastructure sectors, including Communications, Healthcare and Public Health, and Critical Manufacturing.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\n\nBecause of the unpredictable memory layout of HTTPS communication, it is possible that the private key of the mGuard web graphic user interface could be disclosed. An attacker could use this key to impersonate the authenticated user and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.\nCVE-2014-0160NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160, web site last accessed April 15, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nAll users of the affected mGuard firmware Versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1 should upgrade to mGuard firmware Version 8.0.2. Innominate recommends users update SSL keys on the affected products after upgrade. The mGuard firmware Version 8.0.2 provides a combined function to replace both the HTTPS and SSH keys.\nFor more information regarding this vulnerability and specific instructions on how to install the latest firmware version, please see the Innominate Security Advisory published April 11, 2014, at the following location:\nhttp://www.innominate.com/data/downloads/software/innominate_security_advisory_20140411_001_en.pdf\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 --------\nPhoenix Contact branded devices are not vulnerable to this issue, as they are using mGuard firmware Version 7.5 that is not affected by HeartBleed. Only mGuard firmware Versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1 are affected. Phoenix Contact has posted the 8.0.2 firmware patch release on its web site:\nhttps://www.phoenixcontact.com/mguardsecurity\n--------- End Update A Part 4 of 4 ----------\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
