EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.0\n\nVendor: Omron\nEquipment: CX-Supervisor\nVulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Out-Of-Bounds Read, Use-After-Free, Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-18-290-01 Omron CX-Supervisor that was published October 17, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code under the context of the application, corrupt objects, and force the application to read a value outside of an array.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CX-Supervisor are affected:\n\nCX-Supervisor Versions 3.4.1.0 and prior.\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nWhen processing project files and tampering with a specific byte, memory corruption may occur within a specific object.\nCVE-2018-17905 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nWhen processing project files and tampering with the value of an offset, an attacker can force the application to read a value outside of an array.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17907 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nWhen processing project files the application fails to check if it is referencing freed memory, which may allow an attacker to execute code in under the context of the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17909 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT TYPE VERSION OR CAST CWE-704\nA type confusion vulnerability exists when processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-17913 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nMat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, Esteban Ruiz (mr_me) of Source Incite, Ariele Caltabiano (kimiya) of 9SG Security Team, and b0nd @garage4hackers working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\n5. MITIGATIONS\nOmron has released Version 3.4.2 of CX-Supervisor to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of CX-Supervisor at the following location:\nhttps://www.myomron.com/index.php?action=kb&article=1709\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
