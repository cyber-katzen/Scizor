EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Crestron\nEquipment: TSW-X60 and MC3\nVulnerabilities: OS Command Injections, Improper Access Control, Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution with escalated system privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products and versions are affected:\n\nTSW-X60, all versions prior to 2.001.0037.001; and\nMC3, all versions prior to 1.502.0047.001\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\nThis vulnerability may allow unauthenticated remote code execution via a Bash shell service in Crestron Toolbox Protocol (CTP). This vulnerability only affects TSW-X60 devices.\nCVE-2018-11228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\nThe vulnerability may allow unauthenticated remote code execution via command injection in Crestron Toolbox Protocol (CTP). This vulnerability only affects TSW-X60 devices.\nCVE-2018-11229 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe devices are shipped with authentication disabled, and there is no indication to users that they need to take steps to enable it. When compromised, the access to the CTP console is left open.\nCVE-2018-10630 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nThe passwords for special sudo accounts may be calculated using information accessible to those with regular user privileges. Attackers could decipher these passwords, which may allow them to execute hidden API calls and escape the CTP console sandbox environment with elevated privileges.\nCVE-2018-13341 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Government Facilities, Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJackson Thuraisamy, working with Security Compass, reported some of these vulnerabilities to Crestron. In addition, Ricky \u201cHeadlessZeke\u201d Lawshae, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCrestron recommends users upgrade their devices to the newest firmware located at:\nTSW-X60 (login required) \u2013 https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Software-Firmware/Firmware/Touchpanels/TSW-560-TSW-760-TSW-1060/2-001-0040-01\nMC3 (login required) \u2013 https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Software-Firmware/Firmware/3-Series-Processors/MC3/1-502-0047-001\nCrestron also recommends users refer to Crestron\u2019s Online Help for more information about these and other vulnerabilities (Article #5471). Information for hardening devices is available in Article #5571.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
