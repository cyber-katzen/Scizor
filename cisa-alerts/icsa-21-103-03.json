EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: JTEKT Corporation\nEquipment: TOYOPUC products\nVulnerability: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user to stop Ethernet communications between devices from being established.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of these TOYOPUC product series are affected:\n\nTOYOPUC-PC10 Series:\nPC10G-CPU TCC-6353: All versions\nPC10GE TCC-6464: All versions\nPC10P TCC-6372: All versions\nPC10P-DP TCC-6726: All versions\nPC10P-DP-IO TCC-6752: All versions\nPC10B-P TCC-6373: All versions\nPC10B TCC-1021: All versions\nPC10B-E/C TCU-6521: All versions\nPC10E TCC-4737: All versions\n\nTOYOPUC-Plus Series:\n\nPlus CPU TCC-6740: All versions\nPlus EX TCU-6741: All versions\nPlus EX2 TCU-6858: All versions\nPlus EFR TCU-6743: All versions\nPlus EFR2 TCU-6859: All versions\nPlus 2P-EFR TCU-6929: All versions\nPlus BUS-EX TCU-6900: All versions\n\nTOYOPUC-PC3J/PC2J Series:\n\nFL/ET-T-V2H THU-6289: All versions\n2PORT-EFR THU-6404: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESOURCE SHUTDOWN OR RELEASE CWE-404\nIf Ethernet communication of the affected product is left in an open state by an attacker, Ethernet communications cannot be established with other devices, depending on the settings of the link parameters.\nCVE-2021-27458 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni from Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJTEKT Corporation recommends users to use the following workaround:\n\nAccess the link parameter screen of either \u201cEthernet\u201d or \u201cEthernet (32Port).\u201d\nAccess the Timer setting by clicking on the \u201cTimers\u201d button.\nSet \u201cNon-Reception timer\u201d to \u201cEnable\u201d in the \u201cTimers\u201d section.\nAfter setting the link parameter, connect a computer and a PLC with a USB cable and write the link parameter.\nAfter the writing is completed, perform a reset/start or power-on again.\nAfter reset/start or power-on, the parameter changes take effect.\nWhen \u201cNon-Reception timer\u201d is set to \u201cEnabled,\u201d the connection that was not closed correctly can be reset after the set time has elapsed and a connection can communicate with a device that should be connected.\n\nRequests for additional information can be sent to JTEKT Corporation at JJP_PSIRT@jtekt.co.jp\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
