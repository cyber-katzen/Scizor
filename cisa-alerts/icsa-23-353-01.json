EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3\u00a07.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Subnet Solutions Inc.\nEquipment:\u00a0PowerSYSTEM Center\nVulnerability:\u00a0Unquoted Search Path or Element\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker achieving arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation through the unquoted service path.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PowerSYSTEM Center, a multi-function management platform, are affected:\n\nPowerSYSTEM Center: 2020 v5.0.x through 5.16.x\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0UNQUOTED SEARCH PATH OR ELEMENT CWE-428\nSubnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center versions 2020 v5.0.x through 5.16.x contain a vulnerability that could allow an authorized local user to insert arbitrary code into the unquoted service path and escalate privileges.\nCVE-2023-6631\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKelly Stich of Subnet Solutions Inc. reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSubnet Solutions recommends users upgrade to PowerSYSTEM Center versions 2020 Update 17 or later. To obtain this software, contact Subnet Solution's\u00a0Customer Service.\nAdditionally, Subnet Solutions recommends users apply Application Allowlisting on PowerSYSTEM Center Device Communication Server (DCS) hosts to ensure only trusted executables are able to be run.\nIf unable to apply PowerSYSTEM Center 2020 Update 17, Subnet Solutions recommends users mitigate risk by logging in to the DCS as administrator, opening the Registry Editor, navigating to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services, locating all pscagent.* entries, and modifying the ImagePath key by enclosing it within double quotes (\"). Restart computer when complete.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nDecember 19, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
