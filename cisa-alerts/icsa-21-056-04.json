EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ProSoft Technology\nEquipment: ICX35-HWC-A and ICX35-HWC-E\nVulnerability: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to change the current user\u2019s password and alter device configurations.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ProSoft Technology products, industrial cellular gateways, are affected:\n\nICX35-HWC-A: Versions 1.9.62 and prior\nICX35-HWC-E: Versions 1.9.62 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264\nChanging the password on the module webpage does not require the user to type in the current password first. Thus, the password could be changed by a user or external process without knowledge of the current password.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-22661 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMaxim Rupp reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nProSoft Technology recommends users update the product\u2019s firmware to Version 1.10.30\nFor additional information, see ProSoft\u2019s security bulletin pertaining to this issue.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
