SmartLog Diabetes Management Software. i-SENS has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability. Mark Cross has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SmartLog Diabetes Management Software versions are affected:\n\nSmartLog Diabetes Management Software, Version 2.4.0 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nExploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authorized local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nBACKGROUND\ni-SENS\u00a0is a South Korea-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, China, Germany, Peru, India, and Chile.\nThe affected product, SmartLog Diabetes Management Software, is software for patients to track and monitor personal blood glucose levels by connecting their blood glucose meters via USB to a computer. According to i-SENS,\u00a0SmartLog Diabetes Management Software is deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sector. i-SENS estimates that these products are distributed and used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH OR ELEMENTCWE-428: Uncontrolled Search Path or Element, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/428.html, web site last accessed September 7, 2017.\n\nAn uncontrolled search path element vulnerability has been identified which could be exploited by placing a specially crafted DLL file in the search path. If the malicious DLL is loaded prior to the valid DLL, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system. This vulnerability does not affect the connected blood glucose monitor and would not impact delivery of therapy to the patient.\nCVE-2017-13993NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-13993, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed September 7, 2017.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the specially crafted, malicious DLL file.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill level could exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\ni-SENS produced an update for the SmartLog Diabetes Management Software, Version 2.4.1, which was released to the i-SENS website on September 1, 2017.
