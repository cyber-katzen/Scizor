RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated user to gain root privileges on the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PanelView 5510, an HMI, are affected:\n\nAll versions manufactured before March 13, 2019, that have never been updated to v4.003, v5.002, or later.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nA remote, unauthenticated threat actor with access to an affected PanelView 5510 Graphic Display, upon successful exploit, may boot-up the terminal and gain root-level access to the device\u2019s file system.\nCVE-2019-10970 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, Transportation, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation reports users using PanelView 5510 with manufacturing dates prior to March 13, 2019, are encouraged to update to an available revision that addresses the associated risk.\nFor PanelView 5510 using v4, apply v4.003 or later and for PanelView 5510 using v5, apply v5.002 or later. Updates are available at:\nhttps://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=5510&crumb=112 (login required)\nRockwell Automation\u00a0also recommends applying the following specific mitigations:\n\nBlock all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to Ports 2222 and 44818/TCP and UDP using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances.\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/anti-malware programs, and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\n\nFor more information see Rockwell Automation security advisory 1088080 found at:\nhttp://www.rockwellautomation.com/knowledgebase (login required)\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
