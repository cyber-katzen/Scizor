KMC Controls has produced new firmware to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Maxim Rupp has tested the new firmware to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nKMC Controls reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products:\n\nBAC-5051E routers, firmware versions prior to E0.2.0.2\n\nIMPACT\nAn unauthorized user can exploit these vulnerabilities to read the configuration of the target device.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nKMC Controls is based in the United States.\nThe affected products, BAC-5051E routers, are used in building automation systems. According to KMC Controls, BAC-5051E routers are used in Commercial Facilities. KMC Controls estimates that these products are used in the Americas, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERYCWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html, web site last accessed June 07, 2016.\n\nAn unauthorized user can use a CSRF attack to read configuration data from a file.\nCVE-2016-4494NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4494, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed June 07, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nKMC Controls has released firmware Version E0.2.0.2 for the BAC-5051E router to add additional security for web-based access to the router\u2019s configuration pages. KMC Controls recommends that all BAC-5051E routers be upgraded to this version. Users can obtain the latest version of the firmware in the KMC Controls partner portal (requires a login).\nhttps://partners.kmccontrols.com/user/login\nAccording to KMC Controls, the BAC-5051E router is not intended to be a public facing Internet device. For best security, install the router behind a firewall inside a site\u2019s intranet network. KMC Controls has also sent a copy of its technical bulletin to users. A copy of this bulletin can be found on KMC Controls\u2019 web site in the service bulletin section.\nICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In addition, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
