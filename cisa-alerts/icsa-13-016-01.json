This vulnerability was reported to Schneider Electric by security researcher Arthur Gervais.\nThe SESU is a centralized update mechanism for updating Schneider Electric software on Windows PC. Schneider Electric has updated the SESU client as of January 2013, which adds the use of HTTPS to resolve this vulnerability.This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAccording to Schneider Electric, the following products and versions are affected by use of the SESU mechanism:\n\nUnity Pro, V5.0 L, M, S, XL,\nUnity Pro, V6.0 L, M, S, XL,\nUnity Pro, V6.1 L, M, S, XL,\nUnity Pro, V0 L, M, S, XL, XLS,\nVijeo Designer V6.0.x, V6.1.0.x, V5.0.0.x, V5.1.0.x,\nVijeo Designer Opti V6.0.x, V5.1.0.x, V5.0.0.x,\nWeb Gate Client Files V5.1.x,\nIDS V1.0, V2.0,\nPowerSuite 2.5,\nSmart Widget Acti 9 V1.0.0.0,\nSmart Widget H8035 V1.0.0.0,\nSmart Widget H8036 V1.0.0.0,\nSmart Widget PM201 V1.0.0.0,\nSmart Widget PM710 V1.0.0.0,\nSmart Widget PM750 V1.0.0.0,\nSoMachine V1.2.1,\nSpacail.pro V1.0.0.x, and\nSESU V1.0.x, V1.1.x\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessfully exploiting this vulnerability could result in arbitrary code execution.Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization.ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric is a manufacturer and integrator of energy management equipment and software. According to Schneider Electric, their products are used in energy, industry, and building automation worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nAuthenticated Communications RiskCWE-287: Improper Authentication, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html, CWE-287, Improper Authentication, Web site last accessed January 16, 2013.\nSchneider Electric software on the customer PC uses the SESU service as the mechanism of communication with the Schneider Electric central update server in order to receive periodic software updates. The SESU client on the customer PC does not check the authenticity of the origin. By redirecting messages to Port 80/TCP on an unauthorized source, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system that could result in loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality.\nCVE-2013-0655NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0655, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report.

A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits exist that target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a medium skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSchneider Electric has produced a customer notificationSchneider Electric Customer Notification, http://www2.schneider-electric.com/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/viewer-news.page?c_filepath=/templatedata/Content/News/data/en/local/cybersecurity/general_information/2013/01/20130109_advisory_of_vulnerability_affecting_schneider_electric_s_software_upda.xml, Web site last accessed January 16, 2012.\u00a0 that contains mitigations to resolve this vulnerability. According to Schneider Electric, in order to resolve the vulnerability with the software server, Schneider Electric has taken the following actions:\n\nThe SESU server has been updated to the latest version. Currently, both HTTP and HTTPS are supported in parallel. HTTPS does ensure signed communication.\nThe new SESU client has been updated as of January 2013 to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. The new version of the SESU Client will be made available to customers for distribution via the SESU mechanism in January 2013.\nCustomers can also use an updated software product CD that will contain the updated SESU client, when the CD becomes available. Contact your local support desk for details.\nWhile both HTTP and HTTPS SESU client functionality is supported currently, several months after starting to update the SESU clients (May 2013) the HTTP port of the SESU server will be disabled. This means that only HTTPS will be supported during SESU client updates from that time forward, which mitigates this current vulnerability.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0 ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
