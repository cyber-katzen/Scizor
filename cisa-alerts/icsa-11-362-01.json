Currently, the exploit code allows an attacker to bind a shell for remote access.\nAccording to the report, exploitation of this vulnerability requires a specially crafted ZIP file to be opened using the affected application.\nScadaTEC has produced a patch that resolves this vulnerability for all affected products and versions. ICS-CERT has validated that these patches fully resolve the vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAccording to ScadaTEC, the following product versions are affected:\n\nScadaPhone V5.3.11.1230 and prior\nModbusTagServer V4.1.1.81 and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution on the targeted human\u2011machine interface (HMI) system. Currently, the exploit code allows an attacker to bind a shell for remote access. However simple modifications to this exploit code could result in additional impacts to systems running affected versions of the products.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to ScadaTEC, ScadaPhone is a notification application that alerts owners and operators concerning the condition of their supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems; it can also write values to the SCADA system.\nScadaTEC\u2019s ModbusTagServer is an OPC server that communicates directly with field devices and makes data available to OPC clients.\nAccording to ScadaTEC, both products are used primarily in the Water Sector but are also used in the Critical Manufacturing and Chemical Sectors in the United States and Australia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nThe published exploit takes advantage of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Abbrevia 3.05 Beta versions.Abbrevia is an open-source compression toolkit. The buffer overflow vulnerability has been fixed in the current version (4.0): http://sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia/, website last accessed December 20, 2011. Abbrevia is a ZIP file handling component that was incorporated into the affected ScadaTEC products.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by using the application to open a specially crafted ZIP file. The buffer overflow causes the program to crash or possibly allows arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2011-4535http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4535. NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE website report. This website will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.  has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploits are known that specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would require moderate skill.\nMITIGATION\nScadaTEC has produced a patch that resolves this vulnerability. ScadaTEC recommends this update be applied to all systems running affected versions of the ScadaPhone and ModbusTagServer.\nTo obtain the patch, customers should contact ScadaTEC directly for download information by calling their support number: 775-348-7336.\nIn addition to applying the available patch, ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, website last accessed December 15, 2011. for more information on avoiding e-mail scams\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, website last accessed December 20, 2011. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
