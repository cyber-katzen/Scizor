MITIGATIONS\nEclipse recommends users apply the\u00a0latest CycloneDDS patches.\neProsima recommends users apply the latest Fast DDS patches.\nCISA reached out to Gurum Networks but did not respond to requests for coordination. Users should contact GurumNetworks for assistance.\nOCI recommends users update to Version 3.18.1 of OpenDDS or later.\nRTI recommends users apply the available patches for these issues. A patch is available on the RTI customer portal or by contacting RTI Support. Also, contact RTI Support for mitigations, including how to use RTI DDS Secure to mitigate against the network amplification issue defined by CVE-2021-38487\nTwin Oaks Computing recommends users apply CoreDX DDS Version 5.9.1 or later, which can be downloaded on the Twin Oaks website (login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
