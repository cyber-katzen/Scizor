This advisory addresses a vulnerability that originates within, and affects the implementation of, the DDS standard. In addition, this advisory addresses other vulnerabilities found within the DDS implementation. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide early notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-21\\-315\\-02 Multiple Data Distribution Service (DDS) Implementations that was published November 11, 2021, to the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.3\\.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Eclipse recommends users apply the [latest CycloneDDS patches](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cyclonedds)  . eProsima recommends users apply the [latest Fast DDS patches](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS)  . CISA reached out to Gurum Networks but did not respond to requests for coordination. Users should [contact GurumNetworks](mailto:contact@gurum.cc)  for assistance. OCI recommends users update to [Version 3\\.18\\.1](https://opendds.org/)  of OpenDDS or later. RTI recommends users apply the available patches for these issues. A patch is available on the [RTI customer portal](https://support.rti.com/s/login/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F)  or by contacting RTI Support. Also, contact [RTI Support](mailto:support@rti.com)  for mitigations, including how to use RTI DDS Secure to mitigate against the network amplification issue defined by [CVE\\-2021\\-38487](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38487)  Twin Oaks Computing recommends users apply CoreDX DDS Version 5\\.9\\.1 or later, which can be downloaded on the [Twin Oaks website](http://www.twinoakscomputing.com/coredx/download)  (login required). CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
