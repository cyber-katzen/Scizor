EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: EKI-1524-CE, EKI-1522-CE, EKI-1521-CE\nVulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the session.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Advantech serial device servers are affected:\n\nEKI-1524-CE series: versions 1.24 and prior\nEKI-1522-CE series: versions 1.24 and prior\nEKI-1521-CE series: versions 1.24 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Cross-Site Scripting CWE-79\nAdvantech EKI-1524, EKI-1522, EKI-1521 devices through version 1.21 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can be triggered by authenticated users in the device name field of the web-interface.\nCVE-2023-4202\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0Cross-Site Scripting CWE-79\nAdvantech EKI-1524, EKI-1522, EKI-1521 devices through version 1.24 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can be triggered by authenticated users in the ping tool of the web-interface.\nCVE-2023-4203\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThese vulnerabilities were discovered during research by R. Haas, A. Resanovic, T. Etzenberger, M. Bineder at St. Plten UAS, supported and coordinated by CyberDanube.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech recommends users upgrade to the latest version available (currently v1.26) as shown below:\n\nEKI-1521-CE\nEKI-1522-CE\nEKI-1524-CE\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
