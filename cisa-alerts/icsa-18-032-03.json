[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGemalto Sentinel License Manager================================ Last Revised February 08, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-032\\-03### **CVSS v3 9\\.9****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Gemalto**Equipment:**  Sentinel License Manager**Vulnerability:**  Null Pointer Dereference, Buffer Overflows, Improper Access ControlAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Sentinel License Manger services are affected:* All HASP SRM, Sentinel HASP, and Sentinel LDK products prior to Sentinel LDK RTE 7\\.55IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, rendering the Sentinel LDK License Manager service unavailable.MITIGATION---------- Gemalto recommends users who have Sentinel LDK run\\-time environment (RTE) Version 2\\.10 through Version 7\\.54 update to Sentinel LDK RTE component Version 7\\.6, or the latest version. The update was available as of July 2017 and can be found at the following location:<https://sentinelcustomer.gemalto.com/sentineldownloads/> For more information about these vulnerabilities, users can contact customer support at:<https://supportportal.gemalto.com/csm> Or visit the vendor\u2019s customer portal at:[http://safenet.gemalto.com/technical\\-support/security\\-updates/](http://safenet.gemalto.com/technical-support/security-updates/%20) [http://sentinel.gemalto.com/technical\\-support/security\\-updates\\-sm/](http://sentinel.gemalto.com/technical-support/security-updates-sm/)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, NCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
