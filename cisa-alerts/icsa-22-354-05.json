EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Industrial Automation\nEquipment: 4G Router DX-3021\nVulnerabilities: Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated user to add files, delete files, or change file permissions.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nDelta reports this vulnerability affects the following 4G Routers:\u00a0\n\nDX-3021L9 versions prior to V1.24\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\nThe webserver in Delta DX-3021 versions prior to 1.24 is vulnerable to command injection through the network diagnosis page. This vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated user to add files, delete files, and change file permissions.\nCVE-2022-4616 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nParul Sindhwad, Anurag M. Chevendra, Dr. Faruk Kazi from CoE-CNDS Lab, VJTI, Mumbai, India reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta fixed this vulnerability and released a new patch, which is available on the Delta download center.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a low attack complexity.\n",
