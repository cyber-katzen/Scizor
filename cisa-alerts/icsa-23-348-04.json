EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.6\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: LOGO! and SIPLUS LOGO! Products\nVulnerability: Improper Protection against Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EM-FI)\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an electromagnetic fault injection, which would allow an attacker to dump and debug the firmware including memory manipulation.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nLOGO! 12/24RCE (6ED1052-1MD08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 12/24RCEo (6ED1052-2MD08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 24CE (6ED1052-1CC08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 24CEo (6ED1052-2CC08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 24RCE (6ED1052-1HB08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 24RCEo (6ED1052-2HB08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 230RCE (6ED1052-1FB08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nLOGO! 230RCEo (6ED1052-2FB08-0BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCE (6AG1052-1MD08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCEo (6AG1052-2MD08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 24CE (6AG1052-1CC08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 24CEo (6AG1052-2CC08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 24RCE (6AG1052-1HB08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 24RCEo (6AG1052-2HB08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 230RCE (6AG1052-1FB08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\nSIPLUS LOGO! 230RCEo (6AG1052-2FB08-7BA1): Versions v8.3 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC FAULT INJECTION (EM-FI) CWE-1319\nAffected devices are vulnerable to an electromagnetic fault injection. This could allow an attacker to dump and debug the firmware, including the manipulation of memory. Further actions could allow to inject public keys of custom created key pairs which are then signed by the product Certificate Authority (CA). The generation of a custom certificate allows communication with, and impersonation of, any device of the same version.\nCVE-2022-42784\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe vulnerability is related to the specific hardware architecture of the LOGO! V8.3 BM. Siemens has released new hardware versions with the LOGO! V8.4 BM product family for several affected devices in which the vulnerability is fixed and the Product CA private key is rotated. Siemens is working on new hardware versions for the SIPLUS devices to address this issue further. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nUse HTTPS communication only in trusted networks without unknown network devices.\nIf possible, connect the Base Module directly with LOGO! Soft Comfort and the Web Browser.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-844582 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nDecember 14, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
