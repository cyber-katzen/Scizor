A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nA remote attacker sending specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data, which may cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-27827 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture,\n\tWater and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the following products:\n\nSIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels: Update to v17 or later\nTIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v2.2 or later\nSIMATIC NET CP 1545-1: Update to v1.1 or later\n\n--------- Begin Update D Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIPLUS S7-1200 CP 1243-1 (6AG1243-1BX30-2AX0): Update to v3.3.46 or later\nSIPLUS S7-1200 CP 1243-1 RAIL (6AG2243-1BX30-1XE0): Update to v3.3.46 or later\n\n--------- End Update D Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC CP 1243-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (6GK7243-1BX30-0XE0): Update to v3.3.46 or later\nSIMATIC NET CP 1243-8 IRC (6GK7243-8RX30-0XE0): Update to v3.3.46 or later\nSINUMERIK ONE MCP: Update to v2.0.1 or later. Please contact a Siemens representative for information on how to obtain the update.\u00a0\nSIMATIC NET CP 1543-1: Update to v3.0 or later\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nDisable LLDP protocol support on Ethernet port. This will potentially disrupt the network visibility.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nPlease see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-941426 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
