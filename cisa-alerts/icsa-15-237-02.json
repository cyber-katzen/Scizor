EasyIO has produced a patch to mitigate this vulnerability. Maxim\u00a0Rupp has tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following EasyIO-30P-SF controllers are affected:\n\nAll EasyIO-30P-SF controllers running firmware prior to build v0.5.21, and\nAll EasyIO-30P-SF controllers running firmware prior to build v2.0.5.21\n\nThis controller is used in a number of Direct Digital Control (DDC) controller products associated with DDC systems from many users worldwide.\nICS-CERT has created a supplementSupplement to ICSA-15-237-02 EasyIO-30P-SF Hard-Coded Credential Vulnerability, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-237-02-Supplement, web site last accessed September 24, 2015. to this advisory that contains a list of nine OEM products that encompass the EasyIO-30P-SF controller. This supplement will be updated as new patch information is received without updating this advisory.\nIMPACT\nExploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker complete access to the controller.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nEasyIO is a Malaysia-based company that markets its controller products worldwide.\nThe affected product, EasyIO-30P-SF, is a 32-bit controller that is used in a number of DDC systems worldwide. According to EasyIO, affected controller units are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. EasyIO markets these products worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUSE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORDCWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html, web site last accessed August 25, 2015.\n\nThe EasyIO-30P-SF controller has a hard-coded credential vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to have complete access to the controller.\nCVE-2015-3974NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3974, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed August 25, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nEasyIO has produced a patch to mitigate this vulnerability. Maxim Rupp has tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nEasyIO has deployed the new patch to all nine OEM vendors to allow them to update their respective products.\nThese vendors are: Accutrol LLC, Bar-Tech Automation Pty Ltd, Infocon/EasyIO, Honeywell Automation India, Johnson Controls Group, SyxthSENSE, Transformative Wave Technologies, LLC, Tridium Asia Pacific Ltd, and Tridium Europe.\nEach vendor has its own method and location for the end users to obtain information on how to receive and install this patch. In some cases, the OEM vendors prefer to be part of the patch process to ensure correct configurations and to minimum unnecessary downtime.\nThese mitigation plans may be found in the ICS-CERT advisory supplement titled Supplement to ICSA-15-237-02 EASYIO-30P-SF Hard-Coded Credential Vulnerability.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (www.ics-cert.org).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
