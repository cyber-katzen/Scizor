An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41660 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\u00a0\n4.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nThe affected products contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing a CGM file. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41661 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected products contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing a CGM file. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41662 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\u00a0\n4.2.5\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nThe affected applications contain a use-after-free vulnerability that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted CGM files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41663 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.6\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected application contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially triggered while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41664 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide \u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nNafiez and Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\u00a0\n5.
