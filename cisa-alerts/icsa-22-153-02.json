EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 10\\.0**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor:** \n Illumina\n* **Equipment:** \n Local Run Manager (LRM)\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Path Traversal, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Improper Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n\n\n2\\. UPDATED INFORMATION\n-----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-22\\-153\\-02 Illumina Local Run Manager that was published June 22, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an unauthenticated malicious actor to take control of the affected product remotely and take any action at the operating system level. An attacker could impact settings, configurations, software, or data on the affected product and interact through the affected product with the connected network..\n \n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following devices and instruments using LRM software are affected:\n   \n\n  \n\n Illumina In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) devices:\n \n\n\n* NextSeq 550Dx: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n* MiSeq Dx: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n\n\n\n Researcher Use Only (ROU) instruments:\n \n\n\n* NextSeq 500 Instrument: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n* NextSeq 550 Instrument: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n* MiSeq Instrument: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n* iSeq 100 Instrument: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n* MiniSeq Instrument: LRM Versions 1\\.3 to 3\\.1\n\n\n### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 4\\.2\\.1\n [EXECUTION WITH UNNECESSARY PRIVILEGES CWE\\-250](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)\n\n\n\n LRM utilizes elevated privileges.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Illumina has developed a software patch to protect against the remote exploitation of these vulnerabilities and is actively working to provide a permanent software fix for current and future instruments.\n \n\n\n\n For instruments connected to the Internet, the software patch is\n [available for download](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/illumina-local-run-manager-1.0.html) \n .\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A: Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Illumnia has released the following hashes for the Local Run Manager in its latest software patch:\n   \n\n  \n\n Filename: LocalRunManagerSecurityPatch.msi\n \n\n\n* SHA\\-512: 52b5cfdc462b10011027e94f184c2f0da25b0b1363fddb7fa5793938d11f976259a7f73e77c2fd157f560439ec3df70446aa561b586dc8ef94db2ed95fcce841\n* SHA\\-256: 595b724f1c5b4bac446001400b38b748b4ef05520b5489ea4711a2a4289e721a\n* SHA\\-1: 25e523031b3bd818d4bba1017c534c735f650e23\n* MD5: 4552a1130947b95ac18be4335c1447f5\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A: Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n For affected products not connected to the Internet, Illumina has developed other options for the installation of the software patch. Please contact Illumina Tech Support at\n [techsupport@illumina.com](mailto:techsupport@illumina.com) \n to obtain information about these options.\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Illumina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-22-153-02) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2022-1518", "CVE-2022-1517", "CVE-2022-1521", "CVE-2022-1524", "CVE-2022-1519"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-22-153-02", "title": "Illumina Local Run Manager (Update A) | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "7b2f4e7ee6472f3c71d257a461b9d378a91237fe111e58a9a68b4dae443b8b84"}
