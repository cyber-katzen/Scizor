A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Daniel dos Santos and Jos Wetzels of Forescout Technologies reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Phoenix Contact has provided the following mitigations and workarounds:* Phoenix Contact classic line industrial controllers are developed and designed for the use in closed industrial networks using a defense\\-in\\-depth approach focusing on network segmentation and communication robustness. In such an approach, users are protected against attacks, (especially from the outside) by a multi\\-level perimeter, including firewalls as well as dividing the plant into OT zones by using firewalls. This concept is supported by organizational measures in the production plant as part of a security management system. To accomplish security here measures are required at all levels. Ensure that the logic is always transferred or stored in protected environments. This is valid for data in transmission as well as data in rest.* Connections between the engineering tools and the controller must always be in a locally protected environment or protected by VPN for remote access.* Project data should not send as a file via email or other transfer mechanisms without additional integrity and authenticity checks.* Project data should be saved in protected environments only.* Customers using Phoenix Contact classic line controllers are recommended to operate the devices in closed networks or protected with a suitable firewall as intended.[Measures to protect devices based on classic control technology](https://dam-mdc.phoenixcontact.com/asset/156443151564/74777de2d270be4cb4828ee57173dbd0/Application-note_110637_en_00.pdf)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
