EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Omron* **Equipment:**  CX\\-One* **Vulnerabilities:**  Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Type Confusion2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed. In addition, a buffer overflow condition may allow remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of CX\\-One, an Automation Software Suite, are affected:* CX\\-One Versions 4\\.60 and prior, including the following applications:\t+ CX\\-Protocol Versions 2\\.02 and prior\t+ CX\\-Server Versions 5\\.0\\.28 and prior\t+ CX\\-Position Versions 2\\.52 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-822](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/822.html) The affected product may allow an attacker to supply a pointer to arbitrary memory locations, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2020\\-27259](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27259)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) The affected product is vulnerable to a stack\\-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2020\\-27261](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27261)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE\\-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html) This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code due to the lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data, which can result in a type\\-confusion condition.[CVE\\-2020\\-27257](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27257)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER rgod, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Omron has released an updated version of CX\\-One to address the reported vulnerabilities.
