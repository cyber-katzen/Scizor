EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely / low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment: SICAM Q100\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Session Fixation, Improper Input Validation\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take over the session of a logged in user or to inject custom code.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SICAM Q100 products:\u00a0\n\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA31-2AA1): prior to V2.50\u00a0\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA01-2AA1): prior to V2.50\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0SESSION FIXATION CWE-384\u00a0\nAffected devices do not renew the session cookies after login/logout, and also accept user-defined session cookies. An attacker could overwrite the stored session cookie of a user. After the victim logs in, the attacker is given access to the user's account through the activated session.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43398 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAffected devices do not properly validate the Language-parameter in requests to the web interface on port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43439 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAffected devices do not properly validate the RecordType-parameter in requests to the web interface on port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43545 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAffected devices do not properly validate the EndTime-parameter in requests to the web interface on port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-43546 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\u00a0\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to V2.50 or a later version. \u00a0\nSiemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nRestrict access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only\u00a0\n\nOperators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\u00a0\nSiemens recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, operators may use an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances. Siemens recommends prior validation of any security update before application and recommends trained staff supervise the update process in the target environment.\u00a0\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN) and advises configuring the environment according to operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Recommended security guidelines can be found at Siemens' website.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact Siemens ProductCERT.\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-570294 in HTML and CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
