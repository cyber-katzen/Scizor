UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-257-16 Siemens SIPROTEC 5 that was published September 14, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to cause a denial-of-service condition by sending maliciously crafted web requests.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP050: All versions prior to v8.80\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP100: All versions prior to v8.80\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP200: All versions\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP300: All versions prior to v8.80\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nReceived web packets are not properly processed. An unauthenticated remote attacker with access to any of the Ethernet interfaces could send specially crafted packets to force a restart of the target device.\nCVE-2021-37206 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nYuriy Strela from GAI NetConsult GmbH reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends applying updates where available:\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP050: Update to v8.80 or later version\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP100: Update to v8.80 or later version\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP300: Update to v8.80 or later version\n\nFor remaining products, Siemens has identified the following specific workaround and mitigation users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nBlock access to Port 4443/TCP, such as with an external firewall.\n\nOperators of critical power systems (e.g., TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. Therefore, Siemens recommends operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid\u2019s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised users configure the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for Digital Grid Products. in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\u00a0\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-500748\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
