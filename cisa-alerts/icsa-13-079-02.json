WinCC stores user passwords for WebNavigator in an MS SQL database. If an attacker can successfully log into the WinCC database server, these\u00a0 passwords can be extracted. This would allow an attacker access to all functions and privileges of all WinCC users.[CVE\\-2013\\-0678](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0678)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P))  .#### Improper AuthorizationCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285\\.html, CWE\\-285: Improper Authorization, Web site last visited March 20, 2013\\. WinCC provides too many rights to several users in the database. Users with low privileges could read password fields allowing an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.[CVE\\-2013\\-0676](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0676)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N))  .#### Relative Path TraversalCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23\\.html, CWE\\-23: Relative Path Traversal, Web site last visited March 20, 2013\\. The WinCC Web server could return sensitive data if certain file names and paths are queried, e.g., via URL parameters. However, the user needs to be authenticated on the Web server to exploit this vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to browse the file system via URL manipulation and extract sensitive information.[CVE\\-2013\\-0679](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0679)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N))  .#### Buffer OverflowCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, CWE\\-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Web site last visited March 20, The WinCC Web server requires users to install ActiveX component RegReader to use certain WinCC functions. RegReader does not properly check the length of parameters; a malicious site can trigger a buffer overflow with possible remote code execution in the context of the user\u2019s browser. This could allow the attacker to cause a crash or to execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2013\\-0674](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0674)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P))  .#### Improper AuthorizationCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285\\.html, CWE\\-285: Improper Authorization, Web site last visited March 20, 2013\\. The WinCC Web server can allow a legitimate user to parse project files insecurely. If a legitimate user opens a manipulated project, sensitive data can be transmitted via the network or a DoS condition can occur.[CVE\\-2013\\-0677](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0677)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P))  .#### Buffer OverflowCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, CWE\\-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Web site last visited March 20, 2013\\. The WinCC central communications component (CCEServer) is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow that can be triggered over the network. By sending a specially crafted packet to a dynamically assigned port, an attacker can generate a DoS condition against WinCC.[CVE\\-2013\\-0675](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0675)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C))  .### Vulnerability Details#### Exploitability These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.#### Existence of Exploit No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.#### Difficulty An attacker with a low to medium skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.Mitigation---------- Siemens has produced a software updates that resolves these vulnerabilities.
