EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Scada-LTS\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Scada-LTS\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Cross-site Scripting\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow loss of sensitive information and execution of arbitrary code.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Scada-LTS, an open-source HMI, are affected:\u00a0\n\nScada-LTS Versions 2.7.4 and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\u00a0\nScada-LTS versions 2.7.4 and prior are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This could allow a remote attacker to craft malicious URLs that may execute arbitrary code in an authenticated user\u2019s browser and print sensitive information.\u00a0\nCVE-2015-1179\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Open-source Project\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHunter Wodzenski reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nScada-LTS has fixed this vulnerability and Scada-LTS users are recommended to upgrade to\u00a0version 2.7.4.1 or later.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
