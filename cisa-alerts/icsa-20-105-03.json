EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Triangle MicroWorks\nEquipment: SCADA Data Gateway\nVulnerabilities: Stacked-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-Bounds Read, Type Confusion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nThese vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and disclose on affected installations of Triangle Microworks SCADA Data Gateway with DNP3 Outstation channels. Authentication is not required to exploit these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SCADA Data Gateway software are affected:\n\n2.41.0213 through 4.0.122\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers cause a denial-of-service condition due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data, prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2020-10615 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Only applicable to installations using DNP3 Data Sets.\nCVE-2020-10613 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Only applicable to installations using DNP3 Data Sets.\nCVE-2020-10611 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nIncite Team of Steven Seeley and Chris Anastasio, and Tobias Scharnowski, Niklas Breitfeld, and Ali Abbasi working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nTriangle Microworks recommends users update to Version 4.0.123\nPlease contact Triangle MicroWorks support for additional details.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
