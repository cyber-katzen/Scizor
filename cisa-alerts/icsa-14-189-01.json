Yokogawa has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nYokogawa reports that the vulnerability affects the following products:\n\nCENTUM CS 1000 all revisions,\nCENTUM CS 3000 R3.09.50 or earlier,\nCENTUM CS 3000 Entry Class R3.09.50 or earlier,\nCENTUM VP R5.03.20 or earlier,\nCENTUM VP Entry Class R5.03.20 or earlier,\nExaopc R3.72.00 or earlier,\nB/M9000CS R5.05.01 or earlier, and\nB/M9000 VP R7.03.01 or earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nYokogawa is a company based in Japan that maintains offices on several continents, including North and Central America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nCENTUM VP is an integrated production control system.\nExaopc is an OPC server for data access, alarms and events, historical data access, batch information, and a security interface for CENTUM series process control systems.\nB/M9000CS and B/M9000 VP are quality control systems for use in the pulp and paper industry.\n\nAccording to Yokogawa, these products are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and others. Yokogawa estimates that these systems are deployed worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nBUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed July 08, 2014.\n\nThe \u201cBKFSim_vhfd.exe\u201d service, started when running the \u201cFCS/Test Function\u201d for extended virtual testing, listens by default on Port 20010 (TCP and UDP). By sending a specially crafted packet to the Port 20010/UDP, it\u2019s possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the CENTUM user.\nCVE-2014-3888NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3888, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C , web site last accessed July 08, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nYokogawa provides patch software for the latest revisions of the affected products. This vulnerability can be corrected by installing the patch software. The computer must be rebooted to activate the patch software. If the system uses earlier versions of the software than the ones for which the software patches are provided, Yokgawa recommends that users upgrade to the latest revisions/versions and then apply the software patches.\nFor details about individual countermeasures by the affected product, please refer to \u201cYSAR-14-0002E: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in CENTUM systems and Exaopc\u201d on the Yokogawa Security Advisory Report website:\nhttp://www.yokogawa.com/dcs/security/ysar/dcs-ysar-index-en.htm\nYokogawa strongly suggests all customers to introduce appropriate security measures not only for the vulnerabilities identified but also to the overall systems.\nFor questions related to this vulnerability or how to obtain the patch software, please contact Yokogawa service department at the following web address for more details:\nhttps://plus.yokogawa.co.jp/gw/gw.po?c-id=000498\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
