For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Brownfield Connectivity Client\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0OS Command Injection, Improper Certificate Validation, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Siemens Brownfield Connectivity Client products:\u00a0\n\nBrownfield Connectivity Client: All versions prior to V2.15\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nThe c_rehash script does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters, and command injection is possible as a result.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-1292\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\u00a0\nUnder certain circumstances, the command line Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) \u00a0verify function reports successful verification when verification fails. The incorrect successful response is accompanied by error messages showing the failure, despite the successful result.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-1343\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327\u00a0\nWhen using the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite, which is disabled by default, a malicious cyber actor can modify data in transit due to an incorrect use of the AAD data as the MAC key in OpenSSL 3.0. However, the malicious cyber actor is unable to decrypt any communication.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-1434\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER RESOURCE SHUTDOWN OR RELEASE CWE-404\u00a0\nThe OpenSSL version improperly reuses memory when decoding certificates or keys. This could lead to process termination and a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-1473\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an update for Brownfield Connectivity Client and recommends updating to V2.15 or later versions. Users should\u00a0contact Siemens customer support\u00a0to obtain the update.\u00a0\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security is available on the\u00a0Siemens website.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-953464 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users to protect themselves from social engineering attacks. \u00a0\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
