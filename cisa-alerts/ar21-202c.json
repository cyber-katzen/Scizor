Summary      Description     CISA received four (4\\) files related to a Pulse Secure Perl Common Gateway Interface (CGI) exploit.       Three (3\\) of the files (DSUpgrade.pm, tnchcupdate.cgi and healthcheck.cgi) are webshells that have been modified. The primary purpose of these modifications is to provide a remote operator command and control (C2\\) access to a compromised device.       The last file (dsclslog) is a Linux command line utility designed to remove access or event log files. This analysis is derived from malicious files found on Pulse Connect Secure devices.

Analysis of this patched\\-in code indicates it will leverage the sed command to inject a malicious webshell into the Pulse Secure system file /pkg/do\\-install (Figure 1\\). The purpose of the injected webshell is to accept a parameter named \"id\" from within an incoming web application post. The webshell will then process the data provided within the \"id\" parameter as an operating system command by executing it locally utilizing the system() function.

If the system receives a POST request that match any one of the following three conditions it will trigger the malicious code. Otherwise, it defaults to the original Pulse Secure application.       Condition 1: The attacker submits a RC4 encrypted and base64 encoded shell command under the 'cert' parameter. The command is base64 decoded and RC4 decrypted before it is executed. The command's output is sent to the attacker.       Condition 2: The attacker provides input to two parameters: 'img' and 'name'. Then it calls the function (sub c), which only processes input to the 'img' parameter. The input is base64 decoded and RC4 decrypted to a file path. The associated file is read and returns to the attacker.       Condition 3: The attacker submits RC4 encrypted and base64 encoded shell commands under the 'name' parameter, leaving the parameter 'img' blank. The shell command is base64 decoded and RC4 decrypted before it is executed and the command output is RC4 encrypted and base64 encoded before sending to the attacker.       The following functions describe the encryption scheme employed by the malware (Figure 3\\).       sub r: This function generates random bytes to be used in (sub a) for encryption.       sub a: First it calls the (sub r) function to obtain a random six bytes ($k), which is prepended to the hard\\-coded passphrase ($ph) and forms the RC4 encryption key to encrypt the string ($st). The encrypted string is then base64 encoded.       sub b: First, it base64 decodes the input string. The decoded string ($s) is separated into the first six bytes ($k) and the rest without the first six bytes ($en). The first six bytes ($k) is prepended to the hard\\-coded passphrase ($ph) and forms the RC4 decryption key ($k.$ph) to decrypt the string ($en).

Description     This ELF binary is a command\\-line utility that removes the .vc1 and .vc2 of the event log file or access log file. It requires the '\\-f' argument (Figure 5\\) followed by specifying which type of log (access/event) to be removed. When no argument is provided, it prints the usage information: \"Usage:dsclslog \\-f \\[events\\|access] \\-r \\[Regex1,Regex2,Regex3,...]\".       When executed with the '\\-f' option followed by access or event, the message \"Select log file:/home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc0\" will be displayed on the console.       It copies the content of /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc0 into /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc1 and the content of /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc1 into /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc2\\. This results in three log files containing the same .vc0 contents.       Then it executes the following move 'mv' and remove 'rm' commands, resulting in removing log files ending with .vc1 and .vc2, leaving only the .vc0\\. The purpose of this operation could be anti\\-forensic by removing the access or event log files at the choice of the attacker.       \\-\\-Begin commands removing log files\\-\\-     mv /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc2 /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc0     rm /home/runtime/logs/log.\\[access/event].vc1     \\-\\-End commands removing log files\\-\\-       The message \"Clearlog success!\" is displayed after the operation.

Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
