MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Updated versions of MDT AutoSave and AutoSave for System Platform (A4SP) were developed to address these vulnerabilities as follows:\n \n\n\n* MDT AutoSave 6\\.x version: Version 6\\.02\\.06 (Released January 2021\\)\n* MDT AutoSave 7\\.x version: Version 7\\.05 (Released December 2020\\)\n* A4SP 4\\.x version: Version 4\\.01 (Released June 2021\\)\n* A4SP 5\\.x version: Version 5\\.01 (Released May 2021\\)\n\n\n\n For more information about these vulnerabilities, and to obtain and install the new versions, please contact\n [MDT Software customer support](https://www.mdt-software.com/mdt-customer-support/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n .
