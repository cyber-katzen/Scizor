[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryOSIsoft PI ProcessBook and PI ActiveView======================================== Last Revised July 11, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-192\\-05### **CVSS v3 High****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  OSIsoft**Equipment:**  PI ProcessBook and PI ActiveView**Vulnerability:**  Using components with known vulnerabilitiesAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- OSIsoft reports that the vulnerability affects the following PI products:* PI ProcessBook 2015 R2 (3\\.6\\.0\\) and earlier, and* PI ActiveView 2015 R2 (3\\.6\\.0\\) and earlier.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to remotely access arbitrary code.MITIGATION---------- OSIsoft recommends that users upgrade installations to PI ProcessBook 2015 R2 SP1 (3\\.6\\.1\\) and PI ActiveView 2015 R2 SP1 (3\\.6\\.1\\). The upgrade removes the vulnerable components and installs Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) 7\\.1, which is backwards compatible, to maintain scripting capabilities. The upgrade does not completely remove all VBA 6\\.5 components in case other applications utilize them. If no Microsoft Office or third\\-party programs require VBA 6\\.5, remove it after the upgrade. For more information about this vulnerability, how to obtain the new version, or how to install the new version, please see OSIsoft\u2019s alert, AL00321, on their web site at the following location:<https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00321> NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW---------------------- Affected versions contain a third\\-party component which contains a vulnerability.
