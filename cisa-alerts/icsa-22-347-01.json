MITIGATIONS--------------- ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend updating the ICONICS Suite software with the [latest security patches when available](https://iconics.force.com/community/s/login/?language=en_US&ec=302&startURL=%2Fcommunity%2Fs%2Fresource-center%2Fsoftware-updates)  (login required). Security updates are released as critical fixes or rollup releases. ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend users take the following mitigation steps:* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from untrusted networks and hosts.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the internet.* Avoid clicking on web links in emails or opening email attachments from untrusted sources.* For systems without patches or fixes, users should:\t+ Only unpack files received from trusted sources.\t+ Protect and encrypt Pack\\&Go packages with a password to prevent modifications by untrustworthy users.\t+ Avoid unpacking a Pack\\&Go package file using a relative path (Note: this would show in the Workbench UI). Users should refer to the [ICONICS whitepaper on security vulnerabilities](https://iconics.com/About/Security/CERT)  for information on security update availability. Refer to the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-014_en.pdf)  for further details and instructions for determining installed versions. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
