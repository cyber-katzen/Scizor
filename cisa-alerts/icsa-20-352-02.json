EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: PTC\nEquipment: Kepware KEPServerEX\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Use After Free\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-352-02 PTC Kepware KEPServerEX that was published December 17, 2020, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a server crashing, a denial-of-service condition, data leakage, or remote code execution.\u00a0\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities found in Kepware KEPServerEX, a connectivity platform:\n\nKEPServerEX: v6.0 to v6.9\nThingWorx Kepware Server: v6.8 and v6.9\nThingWorx Industrial Connectivity: All versions\u00a0\nOPC-Aggregator: All versions\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nThe following products may have a vulnerable component:\u00a0\nRockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise: v6.6.504.0 and v6.9.572.0\nGE Digital Industrial Gateway Server: v7.68.804 and v7.66\nSoftware Toolbox TOP Server: All 6.x versions\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\u00a0\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. Opening a specifically crafted OPC UA message could allow an attacker to crash the server and remotely execute code.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-27265 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. Opening a specifically crafted OPC UA message could allow an attacker to crash the server and potentially leak data.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-27263 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a use after free vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to create and close OPC UA connections at a high rate that may cause a server to crash.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-27267 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nUri Katz of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to PTC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nPTC has released updates for the following products and recommends that users upgrade to the most current supported version:\u00a0\n\nKEPServerEX\n\nVersion 6.6 should upgrade to Version 6.6.362.0\nVersion 6.7 should upgrade to Version 6.7.1067.0\nVersion 6.8 should upgrade to Version 6.8.838.0\nVersion 6.9 should upgrade to Version 6.9.584.0\n\n\nThingWorx Kepware Server\n\nVersion 6.8 should upgrade to Version 6.8.839.0\nVersion 6.9 should upgrade to Version 6.9.584.0\n\n\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nThingWorx Industrial Connectivity\n\nVersion 8.4 should upgrade to Version 8.4 (6.6.362.0)\nVersion 8.5 should upgrade to Version 8.5 (6.7.1068.0)\n\n\nOPC-Aggregator\n\nVersion 6.9 should upgrade to Version 6.9.584.0\n\n\n\nPTC recommends users of the following products upgrade to the most current supported version:\n\nRockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise\n\nVersion 6.6 should upgrade to Version 6.6.550.0\nVersion 6.9 should upgrade to Version 6.9.584.0\n\n\n\nRockwell recommends users upgrade to the most current version available, depending on the base version of the affected product they are using.\u00a0\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\n\n\nGE Digital Industrial Gateway Server\n\nVersions 7.68.804 and 7.66 should update to Version 7.68.839.0\n\n\n\nThe GE Digital Security Advisory GED 20-05 can be accessed on the GE Digital Security Advisories Customer Center webpage.\n\nSoftware Toolbox TOP Server\n\nVersion 6.7 should upgrade to Version 6.7.1068.0\nVersion 6.8 should upgrade to Version 6.8.840.0\nVersion 6.9 should upgrade to Version 6.9.584.0\n\n\n\nSoftware Toolbox has released updates and recommends users update their installations.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
