This vulnerability could lead to a possible denial of service (DoS).\nGE has produced an updated product version that ICST has validated. ICST confirms that the product update resolves the reported vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products and versions are affected:\n\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY: Version 4.01 and greater, and\nProficy Process Systems with CIMPLICITY.\n\nNote: Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2014Cimplicity Versions 4.0 and prior are not affected by this vulnerability.\nIMPACT\nIf exploited, this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the CIMPLICITY built-in Web server to crash or to stop responding to requests.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to GE, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2014Cimplicity is a Client/Server based human-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) application deployed across multiple industries.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nImproper Input Validation VulnerabilityCWE-20: Improper Input Validation http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed January 08, 2013.\nA vulnerability exists in the way that the CIMPLICITY built-in Web server (CimWebServer.exe) processes incoming HTTP traffic because of insufficient input validation. The CIMPLICITY built-in Web server is not enabled by default. When enabled, it listens on Port 80 TCP by default.\nAn attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malformed HTTP requests to the listening service. The attack does not require authentication and can be conducted remotely.\nCVE-2012-4689NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4689 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE has released\u00a0a security advisory and patches\u00a0to address this issue.\nPatches for versions of CIMPLICITY prior to Version 8.0 will not be created. GE recommends customers who are unable to patch or upgrade consider the recommendations below.\nGE has provided the following workaround recommendations that eliminate the need to use the vulnerable component:\nOption 1: Disable the CIMPLICITY built-in Web server if it is not in use.\nGlobalView, WebView, and ThinView expose the existing functionality of the CIMPLICITY HMI application so that it can be viewed via a Web browser.\nIf this functionality is not required, Web-based access can be disabled by the following process:\n\nOpen CIMPLICITY Options.\nSelect the \u201cWebView/ThinView\u201d tab.\n\na. Uncheck the \u201cUse built-in Web server\u201d option.\nb. Uncheck the \u201cStart at boot time\u201d option.\n\n\nSelect the \u201cGlobalView\u201d tab (if GlobalView is installed).\n\nUncheck the \u201cUse built-in Web server\u201d option.\nUncheck the \u201cStart at boot time\u201d option.\n\n\nClick \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nOption 2: Use an alternate Web server to host GlobalView, WebView, or ThinView.\nThe CIMPLICITY built-in Web server can be replaced with a third-party Web application server such as Microsoft IIS.\nTo configure GlobalView, WebView, or ThinView to use IIS:\n\nClear the \u201cUse built-in Web server\u201d check box on the WebView/ThinView and GlobalView tabs of the CIMPLICITY Options dialog box.\nCopy the ProwlerClient.jar file from the WebPages directory of your CIMPLICITY installation to an IIS Web server directory.\nIn the WebView/ThinView or GlobalView tab of CIMPLICITY Options, click on \u201cCreate a Web Page\u201d to create an HTML file for your Web server. Use the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d button to navigate to the directory where you\u2019d like to save the page.\n\nImportant: If you would like to publish the Web page to Microsoft IIS, make sure you save the Web page to an IIS Web directory. By default, this is C:\\InetPub\\wwwroot or a subdirectory, but it could be another location depending on your IIS configuration. You can save the page by clicking the \u201cBrowse Page\u201d button and navigating to the directory or by saving the file to another location and copying it to an IIS directory later.\nThe vulnerable service (CimWebServer.exe) will still run on the system in the \u201cOption 2\u201d configuration. However, because it is no longer listening on a port that is processing HTTP traffic, the vulnerability is not exposed.\nAs with any third-party product, ensure that your IIS Web server is up to date with the latest security patches and follow any secure configuration recommendations from the vendor.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategy.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
