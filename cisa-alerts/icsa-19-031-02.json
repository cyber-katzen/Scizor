MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  IDenticard recommends users upgrade to Version 4\\.2 to address all three vulnerabilities. This software update is provided free of charge. To obtain the new software update and additional information visit [https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/8ikfxeqgdx\\-identicard\\-premi\\-sys\\-v\\-4\\-2](https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/8ikfxeqgdx-identicard-premi-sys-v-4-2)  or contact the IDenticard Technical Support Team at (800\\) 220\\-8096\\. In addition to upgrading to Version 4\\.2, CVE\\-2019\\-3908 requires users to set a new password for the backup/restore feature. For more information see the following link:[https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/s02n8lcmwg\\-backup\\-premi\\-sys\\-4\\-2\\-database\\-with\\-a\\-password](https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/s02n8lcmwg-backup-premi-sys-4-2-database-with-a-password) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  IDenticard also recommends users change the Service Database default username and password. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Restrict or monitor access to Port 9003/TCP.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
