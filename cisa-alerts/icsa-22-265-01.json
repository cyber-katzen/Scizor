A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy, Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER @rgod777, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Measuresoft recommends the following steps to remove full access to the ORCHESTRATOR service:* Open a command\\-line window (CMD) with 'run as administrator'* Use the following command to make the permission change to the ORCHESTRATOR service: sc sdset ORCHESTRATOR D:(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)* As a low\\-level user, attempt to shut down the ORCHESTRATOR service: sc stop ORCHESTRATOR. User will be denied. It will no longer be possible to edit the configuration of the service by a low\\-level user. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
