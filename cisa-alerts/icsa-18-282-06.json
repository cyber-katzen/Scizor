EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.1\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit/information related to these vulnerabilities is publicly available\nVendor: Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co., Ltd\nEquipment: XMeye P2P Cloud Server\nVulnerabilities: Predictable From Observable State, Hidden Functionality, Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to video feeds with the potential to modify settings, replace firmware, and/or execute code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll products using XMeye P2P Cloud Server are affected. Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co., Ltd acts primarily as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and sells few, if any, Xiongmai-branded products. Various vendors sell branded devices with Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co., Ltd hardware/firmware inside. Use the following methods to check the hardware/firmware:\n\nCheck if the product documentation/specifications mention the \u201cXMEye\u201d feature.\nAccess the err.htm page on the device (http://<Camera IP Address>/err.htm). Xiongmai or XMeye will be referenced.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PREDICTABLE FROM OBSERVABLE STATE CWE-341\nAn attacker may be able to use MAC addresses to enumerate potential Cloud IDs. Using this ID, the attacker can discover and connect to valid devices using one of the supported apps.\nCVE-2018-17917 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITY CWE-912\nAn attacker could use an undocumented user account \u201cdefault\u201d with its default password to login to XMeye and access/view video streams.\nCVE-2018-17919 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nNot all device communication is encrypted. This includes the XMeye service and firmware update communication. This could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on video feeds, steal XMeye login credentials, or impersonate the update server with malicious update code.\nCVE-2018-17915 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: China\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nStefan Viehb\u00f6ck on behalf of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co., Ltd has not provided mitigations for these vulnerabilities.\nNCCIC recommends taking immediate action to change the admin account password along with the undocumented \u201cdefault\u201d account password to minimize risk of exploit.\nNCCIC also recommends verifying the source of all firmware updates.\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
