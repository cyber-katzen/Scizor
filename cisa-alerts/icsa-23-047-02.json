TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE X200-4P IRT (6GK5200-4AH00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X201-3P IRT (6GK5201-3BH00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X201-3P IRT PRO (6GK5201-3JR00-2BA6): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X202-2IRT (6GK5202-2BB00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X202-2P IRT (6GK5202-2BH00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X202-2P IRT PRO (6GK5202-2JR00-2BA6): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X204IRT (6GK5204-0BA00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE X204IRT PRO (6GK5204-0JA00-2BA6): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE XF201-3P IRT (6GK5201-3BH00-2BD2): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE XF202-2P IRT (6GK5202-2BH00-2BD2): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE XF204-2BA IRT (6GK5204-2AA00-2BD2): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSCALANCE XF204IRT (6GK5204-0BA00-2BF2): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\nSIPLUS NET SCALANCE X202-2P IRT (6AG1202-2BH00-2BA3): All versions prior to V5.5.0\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\u00a0\nSCALANCE X200 IRT Products all versions prior to V5.5.0 use an SNMP agent (snmp_agent.c) in net-snmp before 5.4.1 that could allow remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service (CPU and memory consumption) via a GETBULK request with a large max-repeaters value.\u00a0\nCVE-2007-5846\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Munich, Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating the software to\u00a0v5.5.0\u00a0or later.\u00a0\nSiemens identified the following specific workaround and mitigation users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nDisable the SNMP service if possible and supported by the product.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines\u00a0for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security webpage.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-617755 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
