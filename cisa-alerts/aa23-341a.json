This advisory draws on\n [that body of information](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/ \"Disrupting SEABORGIUM\u2019s ongoing phishing operations\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n This advisory raises awareness of the spear\\-phishing techniques Star Blizzard uses to target individuals and organizations. This activity is continuing through 2023\\.\n \n\n\n\n To download a PDF version of this advisory, see\n [Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear\\-phishing Campaigns](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-Russian-FSB-cyber-actor-star-blizzard-continues-worldwide-spear-sphishing-campaigns.pdf \"Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear-phishing Campaigns\") \n .\n \n\n\n### **TARGETING PROFILE**\n\n\n\n Since 2019, Star Blizzard has targeted sectors including academia, defense, governmental organizations, NGOs, think tanks and politicians.\n \n\n\n\n Targets in the UK and US appear to have been most affected by Star Blizzard activity, however activity has also been observed against targets in other NATO countries, and countries neighboring Russia.\n \n\n\n\n During 2022, Star Blizzard activity appeared to expand further, to include defense\\-industrial targets, as well as US Department of Energy facilities.\n \n\n\n### **OUTLINE OF THE ATTACKS**\n\n\n\n The activity is typical of spear\\-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets a specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to the targets. In a spear\\-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target to have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to another target, or both.\n \n\n\n#### **Research and Preparation**\n\n\n\n Using open\\-source resources to conduct reconnaissance, including social media and professional networking platforms, Star Blizzard identifies hooks to engage their target. They take the time to research their interests and identify their real\\-world social or professional contacts \\[\n [T1589](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information\") \n ], \\[\n [T1593](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1593/ \"Search Open Websites/Domains\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Star Blizzard creates email accounts impersonating known contacts of their targets to help appear legitimate. They also create fake social media or networking profiles that impersonate respected experts \\[\n [T1585\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1585/001/ \"Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts\") \n ] and have used supposed conference or event invitations as lures.\n \n\n\n\n Star Blizzard uses webmail addresses from different providers, including Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo and Proton mail in their initial approach \\[\n [T1585\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1585/002/ \"Establish Accounts: Email Accounts\") \n ], impersonating known contacts of the target or well\\-known names in the target\u2019s field of interest or sector.\n \n\n\n\n To appear authentic, the actor also creates malicious domains resembling legitimate organizations \\[\n [T1583\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/001/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Domains\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog, but this is not exhaustive.\n \n\n\n#### **Preference for Personal Email Addresses**\n\n\n\n Star Blizzard has predominantly sent spear\\-phishing emails to targets\u2019 personal email addresses, although they have also used targets\u2019 corporate or business email addresses. The actors may intentionally use personal emails to circumvent security controls in place on corporate networks.\n \n\n\n#### **Building a Rapport**\n\n\n\n Having taken the time to research their targets\u2019 interests and contacts to create a believable approach, Star Blizzard now starts to build trust. They often begin by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will engage their targets. There is often some correspondence between attacker and target, sometimes over an extended period, as the attacker builds rapport.\n \n\n\n#### **Delivery of Malicious Link**\n\n\n\n Once trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and shares a link \\[\n [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/002/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\") \n ], apparently to a document or website of interest. This leads the target to an actor\\-controlled server, prompting the target to enter account credentials.\n \n\n\n\n The malicious link may be a URL in an email message, or the actor may embed a link in a document \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/001/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\") \n ] on\n [OneDrive, Google Drive, or other file\\-sharing platforms](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/continued-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe-observed-by-tag/ \"Continued cyber activity in Eastern Europe observed by TAG\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n Star Blizzard uses the open\\-source framework EvilGinx in their spear\\- phishing activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session cookies to successfully bypass the use of two\\-factor authentication \\[\n [T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1539/ \"Steal Web Session Cookie\") \n ], \\[\n [T1550\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1550/004/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Exploitation and Further Activity**\n\n\n\n Whichever delivery method is used, once the target clicks on the malicious URL, they are directed to an actor\\-controlled server that mirrors the sign\\-in page for a legitimate service. Any credentials entered at this point are now compromised.\n \n\n\n\n Star Blizzard then uses the stolen credentials to log in to a target\u2019s email account \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ], where they are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victim\u2019s inbox \\[\n [T1114\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1114/002/ \"Email Collection: Remote Email Collection\") \n ]. They have also set up mail\\- forwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondence \\[\n [T1114\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1114/003/ \"Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n The actor has also used their access to a victim email account to access mailing\n ~~\\-~~ \n list data and a victim\u2019s contacts list, which they then use for follow\\- on targeting. They have also used compromised email accounts for further phishing activity \\[\n [T1586\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1586/002/ \"Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts\") \n ].\n \n\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\n\n\n Spear\\-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star Blizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their success.\n \n\n\n\n Individuals and organizations from previously targeted sectors should be vigilant of the techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n In the UK you can\n [report related suspicious activity to the NCSC](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/ \"Report a Cyber Incident\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n Information on effective defense against spear\\-phishing is included in the Mitigations section below.\n \n\n\n### **MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae**\n\n\n\n This report has been compiled with respect to the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise

Use a separate password for email accounts and avoid password re\\-use across multiple services.** \n See NCSC guidance:\n [Top Tips for Staying Secure Online](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email \"Top Tips for Staying Secure Online\") \n .\n* **Use multi\\-factor authentication** \n (2\\-factor authentication/two\\-step authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC guidance:\n [Multi\\-factor Authentication for Online Services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services \"Multi-factor Authentication for Online Services\") \n and\n [Setting Up 2\\-Step Verification (2SV)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-2-step-verification-2sv \"Setting Up 2-Step Verification (2SV)\") \n .\n* **Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date:** \n Use the latest supported versions, apply security updates promptly, use anti\\-virus and scan regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC guidance:\n [Device Security Guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/policies-and-settings/antivirus-and-other-security-software \"Device Security Guidance\") \n .\n* **Exercise vigilance.** \n Spear\\-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion. You may recognize the sender\u2019s name, but has the email come from an address that you recognize? Would you expect contact from this person\u2019s webmail address rather than their corporate email address? Has the suspicious email come to your personal/webmail address\u00a0rather than your corporate one? Can you verify that the email is legitimate via another means? See NCSC guidance:\n [Phishing attacks: Defending Your Organization](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing \"Phishing attacks: Defending Your Organization\") \n and\n [Internet Crime Complaint Center(IC3\\) \\| Industry Alerts](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts \"Internet Crime Complaint Center(IC3) | Industry Alerts\") \n .\n* **Enable your email providers\u2019 automated email scanning features.** \n These are turned on by default for consumer mail providers. See NCSC guidance:\n [Telling Users to \"Avoid Clicking Bad Links\" Still Isn\u2019t Working](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/telling-users-to-avoid-clicking-bad-links-still-isnt-working \"Telling Users to \\\"Avoid Clicking Bad Links\\\" Still Isn\u2019t Working\") \n .\n* **Disable mail\\-forwarding.** \n Attackers have been observed to set up mail\\-forwarding rules to maintain visibility of target emails.
