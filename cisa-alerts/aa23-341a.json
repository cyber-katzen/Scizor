This advisory draws on that body of information.\nThis advisory raises awareness of the spear-phishing techniques Star Blizzard uses to target individuals and organizations. This activity is continuing through 2023.\nTo download a PDF version of this advisory, see\u00a0Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear-phishing Campaigns.\nTARGETING PROFILE\nSince 2019, Star Blizzard has targeted sectors including academia, defense, governmental organizations, NGOs, think tanks and politicians.\nTargets in the UK and US appear to have been most affected by Star Blizzard activity, however activity has also been observed against targets in other NATO countries, and countries neighboring Russia.\nDuring 2022, Star Blizzard activity appeared to expand further, to include defense-industrial targets, as well as US Department of Energy facilities.\nOUTLINE OF THE ATTACKS\nThe activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets a specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to the targets. In a spear-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target to have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to another target, or both.\nResearch and Preparation\nUsing open-source resources to conduct reconnaissance, including social media and professional networking platforms, Star Blizzard identifies hooks to engage their target. They take the time to research their interests and identify their real-world social or professional contacts [T1589], [T1593].\nStar Blizzard creates email accounts impersonating known contacts of their targets to help appear legitimate. They also create fake social media or networking profiles that impersonate respected experts [T1585.001] and have used supposed conference or event invitations as lures.\nStar Blizzard uses webmail addresses from different providers, including Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo and Proton mail in their initial approach [T1585.002], impersonating known contacts of the target or well-known names in the target\u2019s field of interest or sector.\nTo appear authentic, the actor also creates malicious domains resembling legitimate organizations [T1583.001].\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog, but this is not exhaustive.\nPreference for Personal Email Addresses\nStar Blizzard has predominantly sent spear-phishing emails to targets\u2019 personal email addresses, although they have also used targets\u2019 corporate or business email addresses. The actors may intentionally use personal emails to circumvent security controls in place on corporate networks.\nBuilding a Rapport\nHaving taken the time to research their targets\u2019 interests and contacts to create a believable approach, Star Blizzard now starts to build trust. They often begin by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will engage their targets. There is often some correspondence between attacker and target, sometimes over an extended period, as the attacker builds rapport.\nDelivery of Malicious Link\nOnce trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and shares a link [T1566.002], apparently to a document or website of interest. This leads the target to an actor-controlled server, prompting the target to enter account credentials.\nThe malicious link may be a URL in an email message, or the actor may embed a link in a document [T1566.001] on OneDrive, Google Drive, or other file-sharing platforms.\nStar Blizzard uses the open-source framework EvilGinx in their spear- phishing activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session cookies to successfully bypass the use of two-factor authentication [T1539], [T1550.004].\nExploitation and Further Activity\nWhichever delivery method is used, once the target clicks on the malicious URL, they are directed to an actor-controlled server that mirrors the sign-in page for a legitimate service. Any credentials entered at this point are now compromised.\nStar Blizzard then uses the stolen credentials to log in to a target\u2019s email account [T1078], where they are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victim\u2019s inbox [T1114.002]. They have also set up mail- forwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondence [T1114.003].\nThe actor has also used their access to a victim email account to access mailing-list data and a victim\u2019s contacts list, which they then use for follow- on targeting. They have also used compromised email accounts for further phishing activity [T1586.002].\nCONCLUSION\nSpear-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star Blizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their success.\nIndividuals and organizations from previously targeted sectors should be vigilant of the techniques described in this advisory.\nIn the UK you can report related suspicious activity to the NCSC.\nInformation on effective defense against spear-phishing is included in the Mitigations section below.\nMITRE ATT&CK\u00ae\nThis report has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.\n\n\n\nTactic\nID\nTechnique\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nReconnaissance\nT1593\nSearch Open Websites/Domains\nStar Blizzard uses open-source research and social media to identify information about victims to use in targeting.\n\n\nReconnaissance\nT1589\nGather Victim Identity Information\nStar Blizzard uses online data sets and open-source resources to gather information about their targets.\n\n\nResource Development\nT1585.001\nEstablish Accounts: Social Media Accounts\nStar Blizzard has been observed establishing fraudulent profiles on professional networking sites to conduct reconnaissance.\n\n\nResource Development\nT1585.002\nEstablish Accounts: Email Accounts\nStar Blizzard registers consumer email accounts matching the names of individuals they are impersonating to conduct spear-phishing activity.\n\n\nResource Development\nT1583.001\nAcquire Infrastructure: Domains\nStar Blizzard registers domains to host their phishing framework.\n\n\nResource Development\nT1586.002\nCompromise Accounts: Email Accounts\nStar Blizzard has been observed using compromised victim email accounts to conduct spear-phishing activity against contacts of the original victim.\n\n\nInitial Access\nT1078\nValid Accounts\nStar Blizzard uses compromised credentials, captured from fake log- in pages, to log in to valid victim user accounts.\n\n\nInitial Access\nT1566.001\nPhishing: Spear-phishing Attachment\nStar Blizzard uses malicious links embedded in email attachments to direct victims to their credential-stealing sites.\n\n\nInitial Access\nT1566.002\nPhishing: Spear-phishing Link\nStar Blizzard sends spear-phishing emails with malicious links directly to credential-stealing sites, or to documents hosted on a file-sharing site, which then direct victims to credential-stealing sites.\n\n\nDefense Evasion\nT1550.004\nUse Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie\nStar Blizzard bypasses multi-factor authentication on victim email accounts by using session cookies stolen using EvilGinx.\n\n\nCredential Access\nT1539\nSteal Web Session Cookie\nStar Blizzard uses EvilGinx to steal the session cookies of victims directed to their fake log-in domains.\n\n\nCollection\nT1114.002\nEmail Collection: Remote Email Collection\nStar Blizzard interacts directly with externally facing Exchange services, Office 365 and Google Workspace to access email and steal information using compromised credentials or access tokens.\n\n\nCollection\nT1114.003\nEmail Collection: Email Forwarding Rule\nStar Blizzard abuses email- forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and maintain persistent access to victim's emails, even after compromised credentials are reset.\n\n\n\nMITIGATIONS\nA number of mitigations will be useful in defending against the activity described in this advisory.\n\nUse strong passwords. Use a separate password for email accounts and avoid password re-use across multiple services. See NCSC guidance:\u00a0Top Tips for Staying Secure Online.\nUse multi-factor authentication (2-factor authentication/two-step authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC guidance:\u00a0Multi-factor Authentication for Online Services\u00a0and\u00a0Setting Up 2-Step Verification (2SV).\nProtect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date:\u00a0Use the latest supported versions, apply security updates promptly, use anti-virus and scan regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC guidance:\u00a0Device Security Guidance.\nExercise vigilance. Spear-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion. You may recognize the sender\u2019s name, but has the email come from an address that you recognize? Would you expect contact from this person\u2019s webmail address rather than their corporate email address? Has the suspicious email come to your personal/webmail address\u00a0rather than your corporate one? Can you verify that the email is legitimate via another means? See NCSC guidance:\u00a0Phishing attacks: Defending Your Organization\u00a0and Internet Crime Complaint Center(IC3) | Industry Alerts.\nEnable your email providers\u2019 automated email scanning features. These are turned on by default for consumer mail providers. See NCSC guidance:\u00a0Telling Users to \"Avoid Clicking Bad Links\" Still Isn\u2019t Working.\nDisable mail-forwarding. Attackers have been observed to set up mail-forwarding rules to maintain visibility of target emails. If you cannot disable mail-forwarding, then monitor settings regularly to ensure that a forwarding rule has not been set up by an external malicious actor.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis report draws on information derived from NCSC and industry sources.
