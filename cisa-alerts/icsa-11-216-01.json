[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryScadatec Limited Procyon Telnet Buffer Overflow=============================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-11\\-216\\-01Overview-------- ICS\\-CERT originally released Advisory ICSA\\-11\\-216\\-01P on the US\\-CERT Portal on August 04, 2011\\. This web page release was delayed to allow users sufficient time to download and install the update. ICS\\-CERT has received a report from Knud H\u00f8jgaard of the nSense Vulnerability Coordination Team concerning a vulnerability in the Scadatec Limited Procyon human\\-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) product. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to establish a connection to the Telnet daemon, bypassing proper authentication, and exploit a buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution. ICS\\-CERT has been working with nSense and Scadatec Limited to validate this vulnerability. Scadatec Limited has created a new version (V1\\.14\\) of the Procyon product that fully resolves this issue. nSense has confirmed that Procyon Version V1\\.14 successfully resolves this vulnerability.Affected Products----------------- Scadatec Limited Procyon HMI prior to Version 1\\.14\\.Impact------ Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- Procyon is an HMI product used in a variety of industrial applications that is produced by Scadatec Limited. According to Scadatec Limited, Procyon has known deployments in the UK, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. The total deployment of Procyon is not known because of distribution through third\\-party agents worldwide. Procyon is more widely distributed in manufacturing and transportation applications with a lesser presence in the laboratory, water, and chemical applications.Vulnerability Characterization------------------------------### Vulnerability Overview According to the researcher\u2019s report, the Scadatec Limited Procyon Telnet service listening on Port 23/TCP is vulnerable to a buffer overflowhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, website last accessed September 02, 2011\\. that could allow a DoS or possibly lead to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable. MITREhttp://cvemitre.org/cve/, website last accessed September 06, 2011\\. has assigned number CVE\\-2011\\-3322 to this vulnerability.### Vulnerability Details#### Exploitability This vulnerability is remotely exploitable. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted packet to Port 23/TCP that could cause a buffer overflow, resulting in an arbitrary code execution.#### Existence of Exploit No known exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### Difficulty Creating a working exploit for this vulnerability requires a low to moderate skillset.Mitigation---------- Scadatec Limited has produced a new version of the affected software available at the website listed below. Scadatec Limited has requested customers needing this new version to access this website, use the \u201cContact\u201d tab to reach the \u201cContact Us\u201d window, fill out and submit the form. This will alert Scadatec Limited to send the requester the required password to download this [new version](http://scadatec.co.uk/existing_users.html)  . After downloading the new version, Scadatec Limited recommends the following actions:* First, review the instructions in the Readme file.* Uninstall any existing version of the software.* Install the new version and run as normal. ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) provides a section for [control system security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices)  on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .
