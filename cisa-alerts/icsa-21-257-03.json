MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Schneider Electric has established a remediation plan for future versions of StruxureWare Data Center Expert to fix these vulnerabilities. Until the fix is released, users should immediately follow the security hardening guidelines found in Schneider Electric\u2019s\n [Data Center Expert Security Handbook](https://dcimsupport.ecostruxureit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039289633-Data-Center-Expert-Security-Handbook) \n to reduce the risk of exploit.\n \n\n\n\n Schneider Electric has released security advisory\n [SEVD\\-2021\\-257\\-03](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2021-257-03) \n in response to these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:\n \n\n\n* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\n* Limit software updates to only those networks where devices targeted by the software updates reside.\n* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\n* Do not allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n For more information, refer to the Schneider Electric\n [Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/) \n document.\n \n\n\n\n For more details and assistance on how to protect a user\u2019s installation, contact the local Schneider Electric representative or Schneider Electric\n [Industrial Cybersecurity Services](https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/solutions/cybersecurity/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For further information related to cybersecurity in Schneider Electric\u2019s products, visit the company\u2019s\n [cybersecurity support portal page](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/cybersecurity/overview.jsp) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) \n .
