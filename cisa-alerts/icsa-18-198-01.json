RISK EVALUATION\nAn attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user to open a specially crafted file, allowing the attacker to insert and run arbitrary code. This vulnerability requires user interaction, and the exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the affected product and loads the specially crafted file.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Panel Builder 800, an engineering tool for the process panels included in the product suite Panel 800, are affected:\n\nPanel Builder 800, all versions.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn improper input validation vulnerability has been identified, which may allow an attacker to insert and run arbitrary code on a computer where the affected product is used.\nCVE-2018-10616 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Dams, Water and Wastewater, and Food and Agriculture\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael DePlante of Leahy Center and Michael Flanders of Trend Micro, both working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to ABB. ABB reported it to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB is currently investigating this vulnerability and recommends users follow these suggestions until a corrected version is available.\nRecommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network.\nSuch practices include:\n\nConduct or reinforce cybersecurity awareness training for users of Panel Builder 800:\n\nDescribing general cybersecurity best practice recommendations for industrial control systems,\nInforming that it is possible to infect Panel Builder files with malware,\nDescribing the importance of being careful with files that are received unexpectedly and/or from unexpected sources.\n\n\nCarefully inspecting any files transferred between computers, including scanning them with up-to-date antivirus software, so that only the legitimate files are being transferred.\nUser account management, appropriate authentication and permission management using the principle of least privilege.\n\nPlease see the following cybersecurity advisory on the ABB website for more information:\nhttp://search-ext.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3BSE092089&Action=Launch\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
