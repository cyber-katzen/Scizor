Lucas Apa of IOActive discovered this vulnerability and reported it directly to Siemens. Siemens has provided mitigations and a software hotfix corrects this vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to perform a denial of service (DoS) and possibly gain access to the system via remote code execution.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of SiPass:\n\nSiPass integrated MP2.6 and earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nAttackers exploiting this vulnerability may perform a DoS attack or possibly access the system via remote code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on factors unique to deployment and configuration within each organization. ICS-CERT recommends organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens AG is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens\u2019 principal activities are in the fields of industry, energy, transportation, and healthcare.\nSiPass integrated is a Windows-based client/server system with a wide range of access control and security features. One component of SiPass integrated is SiPass server that is used for central system management.\nVULNERABILITY\u00a0CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nBUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, for acquiring http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, Web site last accessed October 31, 2012.\nBy sending a specially crafted packet to Port 4343/TCP, an attacker can cause a DoS condition with possible remote code execution. The SiPass server accepts these messages and incorrectly processes them, causing the affected conditions. No authentication is required to access this affected network port.\nCVE-2012-5409NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-5409, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has provided a software hotfix resolving the vulnerability for customers of SiPass integrated MP2.4, MP2.5, and MP2.6. Please contact Siemens customer support to acquire this hotfix. Siemens recommends customers with earlier versions of SiPass integrated to upgrade to one of the above mentioned versions. In addition, perimeter firewalls may be configured to block Port 4343/TCP to SiPass server.\nThe affected software components are implemented under the assumption of running in a protected IT environment. Siemens strongly recommends protecting systems according to common security practices.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment proior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
