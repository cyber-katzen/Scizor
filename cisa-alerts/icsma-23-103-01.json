Braun Melsungen AG\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Battery Pack SP with Wi-Fi\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code ('Eval Injection')\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a sophisticated and authenticated attacker to compromise the security of the Space communication device Battery Pack SP with Wi-Fi. An attacker could escalate privileges, view sensitive information, upload arbitrary files, and perform remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following B. Braun products are affected:\u00a0\n\nBattery pack SP with Wi-Fi (SN 138853 and higher) with software 053L000091 (global) / 054U000091 (U.S.) and 053L000092 (global) / 054U000092 (U.S.)\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF DIRECTIVES IN DYNAMICALLY EVALUATED CODE ('EVAL INJECTION') CWE-95\u00a0\nAn improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code vulnerability in the Wi-Fi Battery embedded web server versions L90/U70 and L92/U92 can be used to gain administrative access to the Wi-Fi communication module. An authenticated user, having access to both the medical device Wi-Fi network (such as a biomedical engineering staff member) and the specific B. Braun Battery Pack SP with Wi-Fi web server credentials, could gain administrative (root) access on the infusion pump communication module. This could be used as a vector to launch further attacks.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0888\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Healthcare, Public Health\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTom Johnston, a cyber security consultant, reported this vulnerability to B. Braun.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nB. Braun has released software updates to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities:\u00a0\n\nBattery pack SP with Wi-Fi: software 053L000093 (global) / 054U000093 (U.S.)\u00a0\n\nFacilities in Canada utilizing \u201cU\u201d versions of software should follow the U.S. version. \u00a0\nFacilities in Canada utilizing non-\u201cU\u201d versions (e.g. L) should follow the global version.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe infusion pumps are not directly affected. However, the interrupted network communication might prevent certain features of the device from functioning properly. Specifically, an impacted device may be unable to receive infusion orders from EMR/PDMS systems, receive a drug library update, or communicate with DoseTrac.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the\u00a0B. Braun Vulnerability Advisory.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
