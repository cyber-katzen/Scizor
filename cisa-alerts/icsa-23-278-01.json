Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.\n \n\n\n\n For more information, please visit Hitachi Energy's\n [Advisory](https://publisher.hitachienergy.com/preview?DocumentId=8DBD000165&DocumentRevisionId=B&languageCode=en&Preview=true) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n .
