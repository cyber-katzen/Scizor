MITIGATIONS\nHitachi energy recommends the following actions:\n\nAFF66X FW 03.0.02 and earlier:\n\nFor all vulnerabilities, apply mitigation strategy as described in Hitachi Energy's general mitigation factors below or update to upcoming AFF66X 04.x.xx FW when released.\n\n\nAFS66X-S, AFS660-C, AFS66X-B, AFS670-V20 devices:\n\nFor all vulnerabilities, apply mitigation strategy as described in Hitachi Energy's general mitigation factors below or update to upcoming AFS66X, AFS670-V20 7.1.08 FW when released.\nDisable HTTP/HTTPS server or restrict access to HTTP/HTTPS to trusted IP addresses.\nDisable IEC61850-MMS server or restrict access to IEC61850-MMS to trusted IP addresses.\n\n\nAFS65X, AFS67X, AFR677 devices:\n\nFor all vulnerabilities, apply mitigation strategy as described in Hitachi Energy's general mitigation factors below or update to AFS65X, AFS67X, AFR677 09.1.08 FW.\nDisable HTTP/HTTPS server or restrict access to HTTP/HTTPS to trusted IP addresses.\nDisable IEC61850-MMS server.\n\n\n\nHitachi Energy's general mitigation factors:\nSecurity practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.\nFor more information, please visit Hitachi Energy's\u00a0Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
