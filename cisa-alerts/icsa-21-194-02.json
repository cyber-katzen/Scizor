A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8\u00a0has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nM&M Software fdtCONTAINER component in versions below 3.5.20304.x and between 3.6 and 3.6.20304.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data in its project storage.\nNote: This vulnerability could cause local code execution on the engineering workstation when a malicious project file is loaded into the engineering software.\nCVE-2020-12525 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\u00a0\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nAn insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists that could cause unauthorized access to a project file protected by a password when this file is shared with untrusted sources. An attacker may bypass the password protection and be able to view and modify a project file.\nCVE-2021-22780 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n\u00a0\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nAn insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists that could cause a leak of SMTP credentials used for mailbox authentication when an attacker can access a project file.\nCVE-2021-22781 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n\u00a0\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nA missing encryption of sensitive data vulnerability exists that could cause an information leak allowing disclosure of network and process information, credentials, or intellectual property when an attacker can access a project file.\nCVE-2021-22782 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nKai Wang (Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs), Andrey Muravitsky (Kaspersky), Gal Kauffman (Armis), Nicholas Miles (Tenable), Li Wei (Friday Lab - Bolean Tech), Maxim Tumakov (Kaspersky), Kai Wang (Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group), and Artem Zinenko (Kaspersky) reported these vulnerabilities to Schneider Electric.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric provides detailed mitigation information for each of the affected products in their own advisory, for more information about these issues, please refer to the original Schneider Electric publication SEVD-2021-194-01.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
