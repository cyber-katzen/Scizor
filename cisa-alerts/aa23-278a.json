[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity AdvisoryNSA and CISA Red and Blue Teams Share Top Ten Cybersecurity Misconfigurations============================================================================= Release Date October 05, 2023 Alert Code AA23\\-278A Related topics:[Securing Networks](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/securing-networks)  , ,#### **A plea for network defenders and software manufacturers to fix common problems.**### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** The National Security Agency (NSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) to highlight the most common cybersecurity misconfigurations in large organizations, and detail the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) actors use to exploit these misconfigurations. Through NSA and CISA Red and Blue team assessments, as well as through the activities of NSA and CISA Hunt and Incident Response teams, the agencies identified the following 10 most common network misconfigurations:1. Default configurations of software and applications2. Improper separation of user/administrator privilege3. Insufficient internal network monitoring4. Lack of network segmentation5. Poor patch management6. Bypass of system access controls7. Weak or misconfigured multifactor authentication (MFA) methods8. Insufficient access control lists (ACLs) on network shares and services9. Poor credential hygiene10. Unrestricted code execution These misconfigurations illustrate (1\\) a trend of systemic weaknesses in many large organizations, including those with mature cyber postures, and (2\\) the importance of software manufacturers embracing secure\\-by\\-design principles to reduce the burden on network defenders:* Properly trained, staffed, and funded network security teams can implement the known mitigations for these weaknesses.* Software manufacturers must reduce the prevalence of these misconfigurations\u2014thus strengthening the security posture for customers\u2014by incorporating [secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\")  and tactics into their software development practices.\\[1] NSA and CISA encourage network defenders to implement the recommendations found within the [Mitigations](#_Mitigations)  section of this advisory\u2014including the following\u2014to reduce the risk of malicious actors exploiting the identified misconfigurations.* Remove default credentials and harden configurations.* Disable unused services and implement access controls.* Update regularly and automate patching, prioritizing patching of [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")  . \\[2]* Reduce, restrict, audit, and monitor administrative accounts and privileges. NSA and CISA urge software manufacturers to take ownership of improving security outcomes of their customers by embracing secure\\-by\\-design and\\-default tactics, including:* Embedding security controls into product architecture from the start of development and throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).* Eliminating default passwords.* Providing high\\-quality audit logs to customers at no extra charge.* Mandating MFA, ideally [phishing\\-resistant](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\")  , for privileged users and making MFA a default rather than opt\\-in feature.\\[3] Download the PDF version of this report: [PDF, 660 KB](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/05/2003314578/-1/-1/0/JOINT_CSA_TOP_TEN_MISCONFIGURATIONS_TLP-CLEAR.PDF \"NSA and CISA Red and Blue Teams Share Top Ten Cybersecurity Misconfigurations\") ### **TECHNICAL DETAILS****Note:**  This advisory uses the [MITRE ATT\\&CK \u00ae  for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\")  framework, version 13, and the [MITRE D3FEND\u2122](https://d3fend.mitre.org/ \"A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures\")  cybersecurity countermeasures framework.\\[4],\\[5] See the Appendix: MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques section for tables summarizing the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques, and the Mitigations section for MITRE D3FEND countermeasures. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Mapping\")  and CISA\u2019s [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\")  .\\[6],\\[7]#### ***Overview*** Over the years, the following NSA and CISA teams have assessed the security posture of many network enclaves across the Department of Defense (DoD); Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB); state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments; and the private sector:* Depending on the needs of the assessment, NSA Defensive Network Operations (DNO) teams feature capabilities from Red Team (adversary emulation), Blue Team (strategic vulnerability assessment), Hunt (targeted hunt), and/or Tailored Mitigations (defensive countermeasure development).* CISA Vulnerability Management (VM) teams have assessed the security posture of over 1,000 network enclaves. CISA VM teams include [Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA)](/sites/default/files/publications/VM_Assessments_Fact_Sheet_RVA_508C.pdf \"CYBER ASSESSMENT FACT SHEET Risk and Vulnerability Assessment\")  and CISA Red Team Assessments (RTA).\\[8] The RVA team conducts remote and onsite assessment services, including penetration testing and configuration review. RTA emulates cyber threat actors in coordination with an organization to assess the organization\u2019s cyber detection and response capabilities.* CISA Hunt and Incident Response teams conduct proactive and reactive engagements, respectively, on organization networks to identify and detect cyber threats to U.S. infrastructure. During these assessments, NSA and CISA identified the 10 most common network misconfigurations, which are detailed below. These misconfigurations (non\\-prioritized) are systemic weaknesses across many networks. Many of the assessments were of Microsoft \u00ae  Windows \u00ae  and Active Directory \u00ae  environments. This advisory provides details about, and mitigations for, specific issues found during these assessments, and so mostly focuses on these products. However, it should be noted that many other environments contain similar misconfigurations. Network owners and operators should examine their networks for similar misconfigurations even when running other software not specifically mentioned below.#### ***1\\. Default Configurations of Software and Applications*** Default configurations of systems, services, and applications can permit unauthorized access or other malicious activity. Common default configurations include:* Default credentials* Default service permissions and configurations settings##### **Default Credentials** Many software manufacturers release commercial off\\-the\\-shelf (COTS) network devices \u2014which provide user access via applications or web portals\u2014containing predefined default credentials for their built\\-in administrative accounts.\\[9] Malicious actors and assessment teams regularly abuse default credentials by:* Finding credentials with a simple web search \\[ [T1589\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1589/001 \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials\")  ] and using them \\[ [T1078\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/001 \"Valid Accounts: Default Accounts\")  ] to gain authenticated access to a device.* Resetting built\\-in administrative accounts \\[ [T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1098/ \"Account Manipulation\")  ] via predictable forgotten passwords questions.* Leveraging default virtual private network (VPN) credentials for internal network access \\[ [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\")  ].* Leveraging publicly available setup information to identify built\\-in administrative credentials for web applications and gaining access to the application and its underlying database.* Leveraging default credentials on software deployment tools \\[ [T1072](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1072/ \"Software Deployment Tools\")  ] for code execution and lateral movement. In addition to devices that provide network access, printers, scanners, security cameras, conference room audiovisual (AV) equipment, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) phones, and internet of things (IoT) devices commonly contain default credentials that can be used for easy unauthorized access to these devices as well. Further compounding this problem, printers and scanners may have privileged domain accounts loaded so that users can easily scan documents and upload them to a shared drive or email them. Malicious actors who gain access to a printer or scanner using default credentials can use the loaded privileged domain accounts to move laterally from the device and compromise the domain \\[ [T1078\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/002/ \"Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts\")  ].##### **Default Service Permissions and Configuration Settings** Certain services may have overly permissive access controls or vulnerable configurations by default. Additionally, even if the providers do not enable these services by default, malicious actors can easily abuse these services if users or administrators enable them. Assessment teams regularly find the following:* Insecure Active Directory Certificate Services* Insecure legacy protocols/services* Insecure Server Message Block (SMB) service##### *Insecure Active Directory Certificate Services* Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) is a feature used to manage Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates, keys, and encryption inside of Active Directory (AD) environments. ADCS templates are used to build certificates for different types of servers and other entities on an organization\u2019s network. Malicious actors can exploit ADCS and/or ADCS template misconfigurations to manipulate the certificate infrastructure into issuing fraudulent certificates and/or escalate user privileges to domain administrator privileges. These certificates and domain escalation paths may grant actors unauthorized, persistent access to systems and critical data, the ability to impersonate legitimate entities, and the ability to bypass security measures. Assessment teams have observed organizations with the following misconfigurations:* **ADCS servers running with web\\-enrollment enabled**  . If web\\-enrollment is enabled, unauthenticated actors can coerce a server to authenticate to an actor\\-controlled computer, which can relay the authentication to the ADCS web\\-enrollment service and obtain a certificate \\[ [T1649](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1649/ \"Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates\")  ] for the server\u2019s account. These fraudulent, trusted certificates enable actors to use adversary\\-in\\-the\\-middle techniques \\[ [T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1557/ \"Adversary-in-the-Middle\")  ] to masquerade as trusted entities on the network. The actors can also use the certificate for AD authentication to obtain a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) \\[ [T1558\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1558/001/ \"Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Golden Ticket\")  ], which they can use to compromise the server and usually the entire domain.* **ADCS templates where low\\-privileged users have enrollment rights, and the enrollee supplies a subject alternative name.**  Misconfiguring various elements of ADCS templates can result in domain escalation by unauthorized users (e.g., granting low\\-privileged users certificate enrollment rights, allowing requesters to specify a `subjectAltName`  in the certificate signing request \\[CSR], not requiring authorized signatures for CSRs, granting `FullControl`  or `WriteDacl`  permissions to users). Malicious actors can use a low\\-privileged user account to request a certificate with a particular Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and gain a certificate where the SAN matches the User Principal Name (UPN) of a privileged account.**Note:**  For more information on known escalation paths, including [PetitPotam NTLM relay techniques](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005413-mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-on-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-3612b773-4043-4aa9-b23d-b87910cd3429 \"KB5005413: Mitigating NTLM Relay Attacks on Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)\")  , see: [Domain Escalation: PetitPotam NTLM Relay to ADCS Endpoints](https://www.hackingarticles.in/domain-escalation-petitpotam-ntlm-relay-to-adcs-endpoints/ \"Domain Escalation: PetitPotam NTLM Relay to ADCS Endpoints\")  and [Certified Pre\\-Owned, Active Directory Certificate Services](https://posts.specterops.io/certified-pre-owned-d95910965cd2 \"Certified Pre-Owned\")  .\\[10],\\[11],\\[12]##### *Insecure legacy protocols/services* Many vulnerable network services are enabled by default, and assessment teams have observed them enabled in production environments. Specifically, assessment teams have observed Link\\-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT\\-NS), which are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. If these services are enabled in a network, actors can use spoofing, poisoning, and relay techniques \\[ [T1557\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1557/001/ \"Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\")  ] to obtain domain hashes, system access, and potential administrative system sessions. Malicious actors frequently exploit these protocols to compromise entire Windows\u2019 environments. Malicious actors can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a target network by responding to passing traffic, effectively poisoning the service so that target computers will communicate with an actor\\-controlled system instead of the intended one. If the requested system requires identification/authentication, the target computer will send the user\u2019s username and hash to the actor\\-controlled system. The actors then collect the hash and crack it offline to obtain the plain text password \\[ [T1110\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1110/002/ \"Brute Force: Password Cracking\")  ].##### *Insecure Server Message Block (SMB) service* The Server Message Block service is a Windows component primarily for file sharing. Its default configuration, including in the latest version of Windows, does not require signing network messages to ensure authenticity and integrity. If SMB servers do not enforce SMB signing, malicious actors can use machine\\-in\\-the\\-middle techniques, such as NTLM relay. Further, malicious actors can combine a lack of SMB signing with the name resolution poisoning issue (see above) to gain access to remote systems \\[ [T1021\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1021/002/ \"Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\")  ] without needing to capture and crack any hashes.#### ***2\\. Improper Separation of User/Administrator Privilege*** Administrators often assign multiple roles to one account. These accounts have access to a wide range of devices and services, allowing malicious actors to move through a network quickly with one compromised account without triggering lateral movement and/or privilege escalation detection measures. Assessment teams have observed the following common account separation misconfigurations:* Excessive account privileges* Elevated service account permissions* Non\\-essential use of elevated accounts##### **Excessive Account Privileges** Account privileges are intended to control user access to host or application resources to limit access to sensitive information or enforce a least\\-privilege security model. When account privileges are overly permissive, users can see and/or do things they should not be able to, which becomes a security issue as it increases risk exposure and attack surface. Expanding organizations can undergo numerous changes in account management, personnel, and access requirements. These changes commonly lead to privilege creep\u2014the granting of excessive access and unnecessary account privileges. Through the analysis of topical and nested AD groups, a malicious actor can find a user account \\[ [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\")  ] that has been granted account privileges that exceed their need\\-to\\-know or least\\-privilege function. Extraneous access can lead to easy avenues for unauthorized access to data and resources and escalation of privileges in the targeted domain.##### **Elevated Service Account Permissions** Applications often operate using user accounts to access resources. These user accounts, which are known as service accounts, often require elevated privileges. When a malicious actor compromises an application or service using a service account, they will have the same privileges and access as the service account. Malicious actors can exploit elevated service permissions within a domain to gain unauthorized access and control over critical systems. Service accounts are enticing targets for malicious actors because such accounts are often granted elevated permissions within the domain due to the nature of the service, and because access to use the service can be requested by any valid domain user. Due to these factors, kerberoasting\u2014a form of credential access achieved by cracking service account credentials\u2014is a common technique used to gain control over service account targets \\[ [T1558\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1558/003/ \"Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting\")  ].##### **Non\\-Essential Use of Elevated Accounts** IT personnel use domain administrator and other administrator accounts for system and network management due to their inherent elevated privileges. When an administrator account is logged into a compromised host, a malicious actor can steal and use the account's credentials and an AD\\-generated authentication token \\[ [T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1528/ \"Steal Application Access Token\")  ] to move, using the elevated permissions, throughout the domain \\[ [T1550\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1550/001/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material: Application Access Token\")  ]. Using an elevated account for normal day\\-to\\-day, non\\-administrative tasks increases the account\u2019s exposure and, therefore, its risk of compromise and its risk to the network. Malicious actors prioritize obtaining valid domain credentials upon gaining access to a network. Authentication using valid domain credentials allows the execution of secondary enumeration techniques to gain visibility into the target domain and AD structure, including discovery of elevated accounts and where the elevated accounts are used \\[ [T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1087/ \"Account Discovery\")  ]. Targeting elevated accounts (such as domain administrator or system administrators) performing day\\-to\\-day activities provides the most direct path to achieve domain escalation. Systems or applications accessed by the targeted elevated accounts significantly increase the attack surface available to adversaries, providing additional paths and escalation options. After obtaining initial access via an account with administrative permissions, an assessment team compromised a domain in under a business day. The team first gained initial access to the system through phishing \\[ [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\")  ], by which they enticed the end user to download \\[ [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1204 \"User Execution\")  ] and execute malicious payloads. The targeted end\\-user account had administrative permissions, enabling the team to quickly compromise the entire domain.#### ***3\\. Insufficient Internal Network Monitoring*** Some organizations do not optimally configure host and network sensors for traffic collection and end\\-host logging. These insufficient configurations could lead to undetected adversarial compromise. Additionally, improper sensor configurations limit the traffic collection capability needed for enhanced baseline development and detract from timely detection of anomalous activity. Assessment teams have exploited insufficient monitoring to gain access to assessed networks. For example:* An assessment team observed an organization with host\\-based monitoring, but no network monitoring. Host\\-based monitoring informs defensive teams about adverse activities on singular hosts and network monitoring informs about adverse activities traversing hosts \\[ [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0008/ \"Lateral Movement\")  ]. In this example, the organization could identify infected hosts but could not identify where the infection was coming from, and thus could not stop future lateral movement and infections.* An assessment team gained persistent deep access to a large organization with a mature cyber posture. The organization did not detect the assessment team\u2019s lateral movement, persistence, and command and control (C2\\) activity, including when the team attempted noisy activities to trigger a security response. For more information on this activity, see CSA [CISA Red Team Shares Key Findings to Improve Monitoring and Hardening of Networks](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-059a \"CISA Red Team Shares Key Findings to Improve Monitoring and Hardening of Networks\")  .\\[13]#### ***4\\. Lack of Network Segmentation*** Network segmentation separates portions of the network with security boundaries. Lack of network segmentation leaves no security boundaries between the user, production, and critical system networks. Insufficient network segmentation allows an actor who has compromised a resource on the network to move laterally across a variety of systems uncontested. Lack of network segregation additionally leaves organizations significantly more vulnerable to potential ransomware attacks and post\\-exploitation techniques. Lack of segmentation between IT and operational technology (OT) environments places OT environments at risk. For example, assessment teams have often gained access to OT networks\u2014despite prior assurance that the networks were fully air gapped, with no possible connection to the IT network\u2014by finding special purpose, forgotten, or even accidental network connections \\[ [T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1199/ \"Trusted Relationship\")  ].#### ***5\\. Poor Patch Management*** Vendors release patches and updates to address security vulnerabilities. Poor patch management and network hygiene practices often enable adversaries to discover open attack vectors and exploit critical vulnerabilities. Poor patch management includes:* Lack of regular patching* Use of unsupported operating systems (OSs) and outdated firmware##### **Lack of Regular Patching** Failure to apply the latest patches can leave a system open to compromise from publicly available exploits. Due to their ease of discovery\u2014via vulnerability scanning \\[ [T1595\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1595/002/ \"Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning\")  ] and open source research \\[ [T1592](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1592/ \"Gather Victim Host Information\")  ]\u2014and exploitation, these systems are immediate targets for adversaries. Allowing critical vulnerabilities to remain on production systems without applying their corresponding patches significantly increases the attack surface. Organizations should prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")  in their environments.\\[2] Assessment teams have observed threat actors exploiting many CVEs in public\\-facing applications \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\")  ], including:* CVE\\-2019\\-18935 in an unpatched instance of Telerik \u00ae  UI for ASP.NET running on a Microsoft IIS server.\\[14]* CVE\\-2021\\-44228 (Log4Shell) in an unpatched VMware \u00ae  Horizon server.\\[15]* CVE\\-2022\\-24682, CVE\\-2022\\-27924, and CVE\\-2022\\-27925 chained with CVE\\-2022\\-37042, or CVE\\-2022\\-30333 in an unpatched Zimbra \u00ae  Collaboration Suite.\\[16]##### **Use of Unsupported OSs and Outdated Firmware** Using software or hardware that is no longer supported by the vendor poses a significant security risk because new and existing vulnerabilities are no longer patched. Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems to gain unauthorized access, compromise sensitive data, and disrupt operations \\[ [T1210](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1210/ \"Exploitation of Remote Services\")  ]. Assessment teams frequently observe organizations using unsupported Windows operating systems without updates [MS17\\-010](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-verify-that-ms17-010-is-installed-f55d3f13-7a9c-688c-260b-477d0ec9f2c8 \"How to verify that MS17-010 is installed\")  and [MS08\\-67](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2008/ms08-067 \"Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067 - Critical\")  . These updates, released years ago, address critical remote code execution vulnerabilities.\\[17],\\[18]#### ***6\\. Bypass of System Access Controls*** A malicious actor can bypass system access controls by compromising alternate authentication methods in an environment. If a malicious actor can collect hashes in a network, they can use the hashes to authenticate using non\\-standard means, such as pass\\-the\\-hash (PtH) \\[ [T1550\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1550/002/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash\")  ]. By mimicking accounts without the clear\\-text password, an actor can expand and fortify their access without detection. Kerberoasting is also one of the most time\\-efficient ways to elevate privileges and move laterally throughout an organization\u2019s network.#### ***7\\. Weak or Misconfigured MFA Methods***##### **Misconfigured Smart Cards or Tokens** Some networks (generally government or DoD networks) require accounts to use smart cards or tokens. Multifactor requirements can be misconfigured so the password hashes for accounts never change. Even though the password itself is no longer used\u2014because the smart card or token is required instead\u2014there is still a password hash for the account that can be used as an alternative credential for authentication. If the password hash never changes, once a malicious actor has an account\u2019s password hash \\[ [T1111](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1111/ \"Multi-Factor Authentication Interception\")  ], the actor can use it indefinitely, via the PtH technique for as long as that account exists.##### **Lack of Phishing\\-Resistant MFA** Some forms of MFA are vulnerable to phishing, \u201cpush bombing\u201d \\[ [T1621](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1621/ \"Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation\")  ], exploitation of Signaling System 7 (SS7\\) protocol vulnerabilities, and/or \u201cSIM swap\u201d techniques. These attempts, if successful, may allow a threat actor to gain access to MFA authentication credentials or bypass MFA and access the MFA\\-protected systems. (See CISA\u2019s Fact Sheet [Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\")  for more information.)\\[3] For example, assessment teams have used voice phishing to convince users to provide missing MFA information \\[ [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1598/ \"Phishing for Information\")  ]. In one instance, an assessment team knew a user\u2019s main credentials, but their login attempts were blocked by MFA requirements. The team then masqueraded as IT staff and convinced the user to provide the MFA code over the phone, allowing the team to complete their login attempt and gain access to the user\u2019s email and other organizational resources.#### ***8\\. Insufficient ACLs on Network Shares and Services*** Data shares and repositories are primary targets for malicious actors. Network administrators may improperly configure ACLs to allow for unauthorized users to access sensitive or administrative data on shared drives. Actors can use commands, open source tools, or custom malware to look for shared folders and drives \\[ [T1135](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1135/ \"Network Share Discovery\")  ].* In one compromise, a team observed actors use the `net share`  command\u2014which displays information about shared resources on the local computer\u2014and the `ntfsinfo`  command to search network shares on compromised computers. In the same compromise, the actors used a custom tool, [CovalentStealer](/sites/default/files/2023-06/mar-10365227.r1.v1.clear_.pdf \"Malware Analysis Report - CovalentStealer\")  , which is designed to identify file shares on a system, categorize the files \\[ [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\")  ], and upload the files to a remote server \\[ [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\")  ].\\[19],\\[20]* Ransomware actors have used the SoftPerfect \u00ae  Network Scanner, `netscan.exe`  \u2014which can ping computers \\[ [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\")  ], scan ports \\[ [T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1046/ \"Network Service Discovery\")  ], and discover shared folders\u2014and SharpShares to enumerate accessible network shares in a domain.\\[21],\\[22] Malicious actors can then collect and exfiltrate the data from the shared drives and folders. They can then use the data for a variety of purposes, such as extortion of the organization or as intelligence when formulating intrusion plans for further network compromise. Assessment teams routinely find sensitive information on network shares \\[ [T1039](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1039/ \"Data from Network Shared Drive\")  ] that could facilitate follow\\-on activity or provide opportunities for extortion. Teams regularly find drives containing cleartext credentials \\[ [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1552/ \"Unsecured Credentials\")  ] for service accounts, web applications, and even domain administrators. Even when further access is not directly obtained from credentials in file shares, there can be a treasure trove of information for improving situational awareness of the target network, including the network\u2019s topology, service tickets, or vulnerability scan data. In addition, teams regularly identify sensitive data and PII on shared drives (e.g., scanned documents, social security numbers, and tax returns) that could be used for extortion or social engineering of the organization or individuals.#### ***9\\. Poor Credential Hygiene*** Poor credential hygiene facilitates threat actors in obtaining credentials for initial access, persistence, lateral movement, and other follow\\-on activity, especially if phishing\\-resistant MFA is not enabled. Poor credential hygiene includes:* Easily crackable passwords* Cleartext password disclosure##### **Easily Crackable Passwords** Easily crackable passwords are passwords that a malicious actor can guess within a short time using relatively inexpensive computing resources. The presence of easily crackable passwords on a network generally stems from a lack of password length (i.e., shorter than 15 characters) and randomness (i.e., is not unique or can be guessed). This is often due to lax requirements for passwords in organizational policies and user training. A policy that only requires short and simple passwords leaves user passwords susceptible to password cracking. Organizations should provide or allow employee use of password managers to enable the generation and easy use of secure, random passwords for each account. Often, when a credential is obtained, it is a hash (one\\-way encryption) of the password and not the password itself. Although some hashes can be used directly with PtH techniques, many hashes need to be cracked to obtain usable credentials. The cracking process takes the captured hash of the user\u2019s plaintext password and leverages dictionary wordlists and rulesets, often using a database of billions of previously compromised passwords, in an attempt to find the matching plaintext password \\[ [T1110\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1110/002/ \"Brute Force: Password Cracking\")  ]. One of the primary ways to crack passwords is with the open source tool, Hashcat, combined with password lists obtained from publicly released password breaches. Once a malicious actor has access to a plaintext password, they are usually limited only by the account\u2019s permissions. In some cases, the actor may be restricted or detected by advanced defense\\-in\\-depth and zero trust implementations as well, but this has been a rare finding in assessments thus far. Assessment teams have cracked password hashes for NTLM users, Kerberos service account tickets, NetNTLMv2, and PFX stores \\[ [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1555/ \"Credentials from Password Stores\")  ], enabling the team to elevate privileges and move laterally within networks. In 12 hours, one team cracked over 80% of all users' passwords in an Active Directory, resulting in hundreds of valid credentials.##### **Cleartext Password Disclosure** Storing passwords in cleartext is a serious security risk. A malicious actor with access to files containing cleartext passwords \\[ [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1552/001/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\")  ] could use these credentials to log into the affected applications or systems under the guise of a legitimate user. Accountability is lost in this situation as any system logs would record valid user accounts accessing applications or systems. Malicious actors search for text files, spreadsheets, documents, and configuration files in hopes of obtaining cleartext passwords. Assessment teams frequently discover cleartext passwords, allowing them to quickly escalate the emulated intrusion from the compromise of a regular domain user account to that of a privileged account, such as a Domain or Enterprise Administrator. A common tool used for locating cleartext passwords is the open source tool, [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler \"SnaffCon / Snaffler\")  .\\[23]#### ***10\\. Unrestricted Code Execution*** If unverified programs are allowed to execute on hosts, a threat actor can run arbitrary, malicious payloads within a network. Malicious actors often execute code after gaining initial access to a system. For example, after a user falls for a phishing scam, the actor usually convinces the victim to run code on their workstation to gain remote access to the internal network. This code is usually an unverified program that has no legitimate purpose or business reason for running on the network. Assessment teams and malicious actors frequently leverage unrestricted code execution in the form of executables, dynamic link libraries (DLLs), HTML applications, and macros (scripts used in office automation documents) \\[ [T1059\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/005/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic\")  ] to establish initial access, persistence, and lateral movement. In addition, actors often use scripting languages \\[ [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\")  ] to obscure their actions \\[ [T1027\\.010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1027/010/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Command Obfuscation\")  ] and bypass allowlisting\u2014where organizations restrict applications and other forms of code by default and only allow those that are known and trusted. Further, actors may load vulnerable drivers and then exploit the drivers\u2019 known vulnerabilities to execute code in the kernel with the highest level of system privileges to completely compromise the device \\[ [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1068/ \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\")  ].### **MITIGATIONS**#### ***Network Defenders*** NSA and CISA recommend network defenders implement the recommendations that follow to mitigate the issues identified in this advisory. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well as with the [MITRE ATT\\&CK Enterprise Mitigations](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/mitigations/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Mitigations\")  and [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/ \"A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures\")  frameworks.

These mitigations align with tactics provided in joint guide [Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security\\-by\\-Design and \\-Default](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default \"Security-by-Design and -Default\")  . NSA and CISA strongly encourage software manufacturers apply these recommendations to ensure their products are secure \u201cout of the box\u201d and do not require customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, performing monitoring, and conducting routine updates to keep their systems secure.\\[1]*Table 11: Recommendations for Software Manufacturers to Mitigate Identified Misconfigurations* | **Misconfiguration** | **Recommendations for Software Manufacturers** || --- | --- || Default configurations of software and applications | * **Embed security controls into product architecture from the start of development and throughout the entire SDLC**   by following best practices in NIST\u2019s Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF),  [SP 800\\-218](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final \"Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities\")   .\\[54] * **Provide software with security features enabled \u201cout of the box\u201d and accompanied with \u201cloosening\u201d guides**   instead of hardening guides. \u201cLoosening\u201d guides should explain the business risk of decisions in plain, understandable language. || Default configurations of software and applications: Default credentials | * **Eliminate default passwords**   : Do not provide software with default passwords that are universally shared. To eliminate default passwords, require administrators to set a \u201cstrong\u201d password \\[  [CPG 2\\.B](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")   ] during installation and configuration. || Default configurations of software and applications: Default service permissions and configuration settings | * **Consider the user experience consequences of security settings**   : Each new setting increases the cognitive burden on end users and should be assessed in conjunction with the business benefit it derives. Ideally, a setting should not exist; instead, the most secure setting should be integrated into the product by default. When configuration is necessary, the default option should be broadly secure against common threats. || Improper separation of user/administrator privilege:  * Excessive account privileges, * Elevated service account permissions, and * Non\\-essential use of elevated accounts | * **Design products so that the compromise of a single security control does not result in compromise of the entire system**   . For example, ensuring that user privileges are narrowly provisioned by default and ACLs are employed can reduce the impact of a compromised account. Also, software sandboxing techniques can quarantine a vulnerability to limit compromise of an entire application. * **Automatically generate reports for:**  \t+ **Administrators of inactive accounts.**  \t Prompt administrators to set a maximum inactive time and automatically suspend accounts that exceed that threshold. \t+ **Administrators of accounts with administrator privileges**  \t and suggest ways to reduce privilege sprawl. * **Automatically alert administrators of infrequently used services**   and provide recommendations for disabling them or implementing ACLs. || Insufficient internal network monitoring | * **Provide high\\-quality audit logs to customers at no extra charge**   . Audit logs are crucial for detecting and escalating potential security incidents. They are also crucial during an investigation of a suspected or confirmed security incident. Consider best practices such as providing easy integration with a security information and event management (SIEM) system with application programming interface (API) access that uses coordinated universal time (UTC), standard time zone formatting, and robust documentation techniques. || Lack of network segmentation | * **Ensure products are compatible with and tested in segmented network environments**   . || Poor patch management: Lack of regular patching | * **Take steps to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities by embedding security controls into product architecture from the start of development and throughout the SDLC by following best practices in NIST\u2019s SSDF**   ,  [SP 800\\-218](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final \"Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities\")   .\\[54] Pay special attention to: \t+ **Following secure coding practices**  \t \\[ \t [SSDF PW 5\\.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf \"Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities\")  \t ].

NSA and CISA recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 12\u2013Table 21\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. CISA and NSA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.### **LEARN FROM HISTORY** The misconfigurations described above are all too common in assessments and the techniques listed are standard ones leveraged by multiple malicious actors, resulting in numerous real network compromises. Learn from the weaknesses of others and implement the mitigations above properly to protect the network, its sensitive information, and critical missions.### **WORKS CITED** \\[1]\u00a0 \u00a0Joint
