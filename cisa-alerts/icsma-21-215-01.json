A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER UNDERFLOW CWE-191\nA buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite an internal queue data structure, which could allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-37162 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER UNDERFLOW CWE-191\nA specially crafted message to the HMI may cause an overflow, which could allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-37165 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nReceived data can be copied to a stack buffer, resulting in an overflow.\nCVE-2021-37164 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe method used to bind a local service to ports on device interfaces may allow the connection to be hijacked by an external attacker.\nCVE-2021-37166 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DOWNLOAD OF CODE WITHOUT INTEGRITY CHECK CWE-494\nThere is no file validation during an upload for an update.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-37160 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nBarak Hadad and Ben Seri from Armis reported these vulnerabilities to Swisslog.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSwisslog Healthcare recommends upgrading to the latest software version as soon as it becomes available. Version 7.2.5.7 is reported to fix all vulnerabilities above except CVE-2021-37160. Use the latest version together with mitigation methods below to protect against exploitation of all the listed vulnerabilities.\nSwisslog also recommends the following mitigation methods until updated software is deployed:\n\nNetwork firewalls that restrict inter-VLAN traffic on the network must allow inbound and outbound internal network connections for the ports listed in \u201cWindows firewalls.\u201d Do not restrict these ports to specific applications.\nIf there is no firewall between the SCC and the floor devices, apply an extended access control list (ACL) in the Layer 3 VLAN that is dedicated to the PTS floor equipment. Both inbound and outbound access lists are required between the SCC server and floor equipment, allowing the use of the TCP and UDP ports listed.\nEmploy an IDS (intrusion detection system) such as SNORT to detect exploitation attempts.\n\nArmis recommends the following practices to identify and block attempts to exploit these issues.\n\nBlock any use of Telnet (Port 23) on the Translogic PTS stations. The Telnet service is not required in production.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
