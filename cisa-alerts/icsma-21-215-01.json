MITIGATIONS--------------- Swisslog Healthcare recommends upgrading to the latest software version as soon as it becomes available. Version 7\\.2\\.5\\.7 is reported to fix all vulnerabilities above except [CVE\\-2021\\-37160](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-37160)  . Use the latest version together with mitigation methods below to protect against exploitation of all the listed vulnerabilities. Swisslog also recommends the following mitigation methods until updated software is deployed:* Network firewalls that restrict inter\\-VLAN traffic on the network must allow inbound and outbound internal network connections for the ports listed in \u201cWindows firewalls.\u201d Do not restrict these ports to specific applications.* If there is no firewall between the SCC and the floor devices, apply an extended access control list (ACL) in the Layer 3 VLAN that is dedicated to the PTS floor equipment. Both inbound and outbound access lists are required between the SCC server and floor equipment, allowing the use of the TCP and UDP ports listed.* Employ an IDS (intrusion detection system) such as SNORT to detect exploitation attempts. Armis recommends the following practices to identify and block attempts to exploit these issues.* Block any use of Telnet (Port 23\\) on the Translogic PTS stations. The Telnet service is not required in production. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
