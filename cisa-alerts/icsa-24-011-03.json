EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3\u00a09.6\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely, low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Rapid Software LLC\nEquipment:\u00a0Rapid SCADA\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Path Traversal, Relative Path Traversal, Local Privilege Escalation through Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Open Redirect, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Plaintext Storage of a Password, Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker reading sensitive files from the Rapid Scada server, writing files to the Rapid Scada directory (thus achieving code execution), gaining access to sensitive systems via legitimate-seeming phishing attacks, connecting to the server and perfoming attacks using the high privileges of a service, obtaining administrator passwords, learning sensitive information about the internal code of the application, or achieving remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rapid SCADA, an open-source industrial automation platform, are affected:\n\nRapid SCADA: Version 5.8.4 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nBy utilizing a Zip Slip vulnerability in the unpacking routine, an attacker can supply a malicious configuration file to achieve remote code execution.\nCVE-2024-21852\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nBy appending path traversal characters to the filename when using a specific command, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the system.\nCVE-2024-22096\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION THROUGH INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nDue to improper permissions configuration, any authenticated user on the server may write directly to the Scada directory. This may allow privilege escalation.\nCVE-2024-22016\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601\nThe affected product may allow open redirects through the login page. This may redirect users to malicious webpages.\nCVE-2024-21794\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.5\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected product uses hard-coded credentials, which may allow an attacker to connect to a specific port.\nCVE-2024-21764\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE-256\nThe affected product stores plaintext credentials in various places. This may allow an attacker with local access to see them.\nCVE-2024-21869\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0GENERATION OF ERROR MESSAGE CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-209\nThe affected product responds back with an error message containing sensitive data if it receives a specific malformed request.\nCVE-2024-21866\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3\nhas been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy, Transportation\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNoam Moshe of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRapid Software did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of Rapid SCADA are encouraged to contact Rapid Software and keep their systems up to date.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
