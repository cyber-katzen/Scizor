EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: POWER METER SICAM Q100\nVulnerability: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\\\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely execute code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of the POWER METER SICAM Q100 power monitoring device, are affected:\n\nPOWER METER SICAM Q100 (7KG9501-0AA01-0AA1, 7KG9501-0AA01-2AA1, 7KG9501-0AA31-0AA1, 7KG9501-0AA31-2AA1): All versions prior to v2.41\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected firmware contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the web application that could allow a remote attacker with engineer or admin privileges to potentially perform remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-44165 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner of Siemens Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends the following:\n\nUpdate to v2.41 or later version\nRestrict access to the web server, e.g., with a firewall, and ensure that the privileged accounts are protected by strong passwords.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-496292\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
