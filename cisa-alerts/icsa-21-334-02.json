For details on the remote password function and IP filter function, please refer to the following manual for each product.\nMELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application) 1.13 Security \"Remote password\" \"IP filter\"\nMELSEC iQ-R Motion Controller Programming Manual (Common) 6.2 Security Function \"IP filter\"\nMELSEC iQ-R C Controller Module User's Manual (Application) 6.6 Security Function \"IP filter\"\nQnUCPU User's Manual (Communication via Built-in Ethernet Port) CHAPTER 10 REMOTE PASSWORD\nMELSEC-L CPU Module User's Manual (Built-In Ethernet Function) CHAPTER 11 REMOTE PASSWORD\nMELIPC MI5000 Series User's Manual (Application) 11.3 IP Filter Function\n\nFor specific update instructions and additional details, see the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory].(https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-019_en.pdf).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
