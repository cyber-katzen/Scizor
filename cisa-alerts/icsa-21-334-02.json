For details on the remote password function and IP filter function, please refer to the following manual for each product.* MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application) 1\\.13 Security \"Remote password\" \"IP filter\"* MELSEC iQ\\-R Motion Controller Programming Manual (Common) 6\\.2 Security Function \"IP filter\"* MELSEC iQ\\-R C Controller Module User's Manual (Application) 6\\.6 Security Function \"IP filter\"* QnUCPU User's Manual (Communication via Built\\-in Ethernet Port) CHAPTER 10 REMOTE PASSWORD* MELSEC\\-L CPU Module User's Manual (Built\\-In Ethernet Function) CHAPTER 11 REMOTE PASSWORD* MELIPC MI5000 Series User's Manual (Application) 11\\.3 IP Filter Function For specific update instructions and additional details, see the \\[Mitsubishi Electric advisory].( [https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021\\-019\\_en.pdf](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2021-019_en.pdf)  ). CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
