GE\u2019s product updates are not available for the Optima 680, Revolution XQ/i, and THUNIS\\-800\\+ systems. NCCIC recommends that users take additional defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Close all unused ports on affected systems.* Where possible, discontinue or limit the use of non\\-product\\-related third\\-party software, such as email and web browser software on the affected system, which could broaden the attack surface of medical devices.* Ensure that affected systems have applied the most current vendor\\-issued patches available.* Restrict network access to affected systems and ensure they are not directly accessible from the Internet.* Follow good network design practices, such as implementing network segmentation, and use DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control, and monitor all traffic passed between zones and systems.* Monitor and log all network traffic attempting to reach affected products for suspicious activity.* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. GE Healthcare provides updates on vulnerability management and other security information at the following URL:[http://www3\\.gehealthcare.com/en/support/security](http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en/support/security)  NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  .
