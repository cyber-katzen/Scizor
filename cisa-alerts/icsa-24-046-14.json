EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Polarion ALM\nVulnerabilities: Incorrect Default Permissions, Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated access or privilege escalation.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the following products are affected:\n\nPolarion ALM: all versions.\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nSiemens Polarion ALM is vulnerable due to weak file and folder permissions in the installation path. An attacker with local access could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\nCVE-2023-50236\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2023-50236. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe REST API endpoints of doorsconnector of the affected product lacks proper authentication. An unauthenticated attacker could access the endpoints, and potentially execute code.\nCVE-2024-23813\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-23813. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDeniz Cevik from Cyberwise Turkiye and Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens is preparing fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAn administrator can restrict the file and folder path permissions post installation.\nIf DOORS connector is not used in the environment, add the following in the Apache configuration to restrict unauthenticated access:\n\t<If \"%{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#^/polarion/doorsconnector/rest#\"> Require all denied </If>\nIf DOORS connector is used in the environment, limit access to the doorsconnector endpoint to only the specific IP address of the DOORS instance that Polarion synchronizes its data with.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-871717 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
