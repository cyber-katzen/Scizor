EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Horner Automation* **Equipment:**  Cscape* **Vulnerabilities:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow code execution in the context of the current process.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Cscape, a control system application programming software, are affected:* Cscape: All Versions prior to 9\\.90 SP5### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing project files. This could lead to an out\\-of\\-bounds write. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32995](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32995)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE\\-824](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing project files. This could lead to an out\\-of\\-bounds write via an uninitialized pointer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-33015](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-33015)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing project files. This could lead to an out\\-of\\-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-32975](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32975)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
