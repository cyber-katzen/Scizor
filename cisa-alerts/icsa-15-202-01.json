This vulnerability was reported directly to Siemens by Victor Nikitin from i\u2011Grids LLC Russia. Siemens has produced a new firmware update to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:\n\nSIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact product families\n\n\nAll devices that include the EN100 Ethernet module version V4.24 or prior.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker could remotely cause a denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected products, SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices, provide a wide range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation functions for electrical substations and other fields of application. The EN100 module is used for enabling IEC 61850 communications with electrical/optical 100 Mbit interface for SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices. According to Siemens, SIPROTEC devices are deployed across several sectors including Energy. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nDENIAL OF SERVICECWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, web site last accessed July 21, 2015.\n\nSpecially crafted packets sent to Port 50000/UDP could cause a denial of service of the affected device. A manual reboot is required to return the device to service.\nCVE-2015-5374NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5374, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed July 21, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has provided firmware update V4.25 for the EN100 module to fix the vulnerability.\nThe firmware update for SIPROTEC 4 can be obtained here:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-4\nThe firmware update for SIPROTEC Compact can be obtained here:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-compact\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-732541 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nConfigure firewall rules to appropriately restrict traffic to affected devices on Port 50000/UDP.\nMonitor traffic to affected devices on Port 50000/UDP with an intrusion detection system (IDS).\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
