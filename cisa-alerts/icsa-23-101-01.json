RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read and/or overwrite files on the system running the affected software.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ROBOGUIDE-HandlingPRO, a robot simulation software, are affected:\u00a0\n\nROBOGUIDE-HandlingPRO: Versions 9 Rev.ZD and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITA8TION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nFANUC ROBOGUIDE-HandlingPRO Versions 9 Rev.ZD and prior is vulnerable to a path traversal, which could allow an attacker to remotely read files on the system running the affected software.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-1864\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYenting Lee of TXOne Networks reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFANUC recommends users update to the\u00a0latest version.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
