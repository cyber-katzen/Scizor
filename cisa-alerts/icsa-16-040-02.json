Siemens has produced a firmware update to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU versions are affected:\n\nSiemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family, versions prior to Version 1.8.3\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a denial-of-service condition or a replay attack on the affected devices.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected products, the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family, are designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments. According to Siemens, the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, and Chemical. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENT CONTROL FLOW MANAGEMENTCWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/691.html, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.\n\nSpecially crafted packets sent to Port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP) could cause a denial-of-service condition on affected devices. The CPU will automatically restart and remain in STOP mode. To recover from this condition, the CPU needs to be manually put into RUN mode again.\nCVE-2016-2200NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2200, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.\n\nPREDICTABILITY PROBLEMSCWE-340: Predictability Problems, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/340.html, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.\n\nThe replay protection efficiency at Port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP) of the affected devices could be reduced by remote attackers under certain conditions.\nCVE-2016-2201NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2201, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit one of these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has released SIMATIC S7-1500 firmware Version 1.8.3, which addresses the identified vulnerabilities and recommends that users update to the new firmware version, which is available at the following URL:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109478459.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends that users protect network access to SIMATIC S7-1500 CPUs. Siemens advises users to configure the host environment according to operational guidelines, provided in the following URL:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.\nSiemens security advisory, SSA-253230, is available at the following URL:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
