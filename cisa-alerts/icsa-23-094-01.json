TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Nexx Smart Home devices are affected:* Nexx Garage Door Controller (NXG\\-100B, NXG\\-200\\): Version nxg200v\\-p3\\-4\\-1 and prior* Nexx Smart Plug (NXPG\\-100W): Version nxpg100cv4\\-0\\-0 and prior* Nexx Smart Alarm (NXAL\\-100\\): Version nxal100v\\-p1\\-9\\-1and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)** The listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices use hard\\-coded credentials. An attacker with unauthenticated access to the Nexx Home mobile application or the affected firmware could view the credentials and access the MQ Telemetry Server (MQTT) server and the ability to remotely control garage doors or smart plugs for any customer.[CVE\\-2023\\-1748](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1748)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER\\-CONTROLLED KEY CWE\\-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)** The listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices lack proper access control when executing actions. An attacker with a valid NexxHome deviceId could send API requests that the affected devices would execute.[CVE\\-2023\\-1749](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1749)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER\\-CONTROLLED KEY CWE\\-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)** The listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices lack proper access control when executing actions. An attacker with a valid NexxHome deviceId could retrieve device history, set device settings, and retrieve device information.[CVE\\-2023\\-1750](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1750)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** The listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices use a WebSocket server that does not validate if the bearer token in the Authorization header belongs to the device attempting to associate. This could allow any authorized user to receive alarm information and signals meant for other devices which leak a deviceId.[CVE\\-2023\\-1751](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1751)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)** The listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices could allow any user to register an already registered alarm or associated device with only the device\u2019s MAC address.[CVE\\-2023\\-1752](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1752)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sam Sabetan reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Nexx has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of the affected product are encouraged to contact [Nexx support](https://getnexx.com/pages/contact-us)  for additional information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
