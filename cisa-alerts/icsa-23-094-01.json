EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.3\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Nexx\nEquipment:\u00a0Garage Door Controller, Smart Plug, Smart Alarm\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Authorization Bypass through User-controlled Key, Improper Input Validation, Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to receive sensitive information, execute application programmable interface (API) requests, or hijack devices.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Nexx Smart Home devices are affected:\n\nNexx Garage Door Controller (NXG-100B, NXG-200): Version nxg200v-p3-4-1 and prior\nNexx Smart Plug (NXPG-100W): Version nxpg100cv4-0-0 and prior\nNexx Smart Alarm (NXAL-100): Version nxal100v-p1-9-1and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices use hard-coded credentials. An attacker with unauthenticated access to the Nexx Home mobile application or the affected firmware could view the credentials and access the MQ Telemetry Server (MQTT) server and the ability to remotely control garage doors or smart plugs for any customer.\nCVE-2023-1748\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER-CONTROLLED KEY CWE-639\nThe listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices lack proper access control when executing actions. An attacker with a valid NexxHome deviceId could send API requests that the affected devices would execute.\nCVE-2023-1749\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER-CONTROLLED KEY CWE-639\nThe listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices lack proper access control when executing actions. An attacker with a valid NexxHome deviceId could retrieve device history, set device settings, and retrieve device information.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-1750\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices use a WebSocket server that does not validate if the bearer token in the Authorization header belongs to the device attempting to associate. This could allow any authorized user to receive alarm information and signals meant for other devices which leak a deviceId.\nCVE-2023-1751\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe listed versions of Nexx Smart Home devices could allow any user to register an already registered alarm or associated device with only the device\u2019s MAC address.\nCVE-2023-1752\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSam Sabetan reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nNexx has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of the affected product are encouraged to contact\u00a0Nexx support\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
