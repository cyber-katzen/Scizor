MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends the following:\n\nFor Software House C\u2022CURE 9000: Users should upgrade to Version 2.80 or later.\nFor American Dynamics victor Video Management System: Users should upgrade to Version 5.3\u00a0\nDelete the log files from c:\\programdata\\tyco\\installertemp and change the password for the windows account.\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2020-4 v1\n\nFor questions concerning this product, contact Johnson Controls Global Product Security; email: productsecurity@jci.com\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
