RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to access and read cryptographic private keys.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MXview, network management software, are affected:\n\nMXview versions 2.8 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\nThe private key of the web server is able to be read and accessed via an HTTP GET request, which may allow a remote attacker to decrypt encrypted information.\nCVE-2018-7506 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael DePlante of Leahy Center for Digital Investigation at Champlain College reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMoxa has developed a new version of MXview to mitigate the vulnerability. MXview versions 2.9 can be downloaded from the Moxa Support Website.\nNCCIC recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
