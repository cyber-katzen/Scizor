Nicholas Miles has tested this update and validates that it resolves the vulnerability.\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a DoS condition and may also allow the possibility of remote execution of arbitrary code.\nThe Gateway-Server is a third-party component found in multiple control systems manufacturer\u2019s products. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\nThe following 3S products are affected:\nCODESYS Gateway, Version 2.3.9.27\nThis product is also used in many products sold by other vendors. Control systems vendors should review their products, identify those that incorporate the affected software, and take appropriate steps to update their products and notify customers.\nIMPACT\nIf exploited, an attacker could use this vulnerability to remotely cause a DoS with a system crash within the Gateway server application. Remote execution of arbitrary code may also be possible.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to the 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH Web site,http://www.3s-software.com Web site last accessed May 22, 2013. CODESYS is used in virtually all sectors of the automation industry by manufacturers of industrial controllers or intelligent automation devices, by end users in many different industries, or by system integrators who offer automation solutions with CODESYS.\nThis vulnerability affects products primarily found in the energy, critical manufacturing, and industrial automation industries.\nVUNLERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUSE AFTER FREECWE-416: Use After Free, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html, Web site last accessed May 22, 2013.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by referencing memory that has been previously freed by the process. This condition commonly causes a system crash and may also present the possibility for execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2013-2781NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2781, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), Web site last accessed May 22, 2013.\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\n\nEXPLOITABILITY\n\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\n\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n\nDIFFICULTY\n\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\n3S has produced a patch that is available for download from the 3S CODESYS Download page:\nhttp://www.codesys.com/support-training/self-help/downloads-updates.html\nPlease contact CODESYS Support for any additional questions concerning the update.\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
