MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends that users of the affected products take the following actions.:* RJ71EIP91: Consider replacing to the next generation model, CC\\-Link IE TSN Plus Master/Local Module RJ71GN11\\-EIP.* FX5\\-ENET/IP: use IP filter function to block access from untrusted hosts. For details on the IP filter function, please refer to the following manual: \"12\\.1 IP Filter Function\" in the MELSEC iQ\\-F FX5 User's Manual (Ethernet Communication).* SW1DNN\\-EIPCT\\-BD: Download and update the fixed version [Software version \"1\\.02C\" or later](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/#software)* RJ71EIP91 firmware version \"06\" or later: FTP function can be disabled in firmware version \"06\" or later. Except when configuring with the EtherNet/IP Configuration Tool, to prevent unauthorized access from outside, set the connection to \"Deny connection\" in the EtherNet/IP Configuration Tool Connection Permission Change function and disable the EtherNet/IP module's FTP function of the EtherNet/IP module. However, firmware versions earlier than \"06\" cannot be updated to version \"06\" or later. For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the following manuals: MELSEC iQ\\-R EtherNet/IP Module User's Manual (Application) \"1\\.3 Ethernet/IP Configuration Tool Connectable Function\". Mitsubishi Electric recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities common to RJ71EIP91 and FX5\\-ENET/IP:* Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.* Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Restrict physical access to prevent untrusted devices LAN to which the affected product connects.* Avoid uploading/downloading files directly using FTP, and use the EtherNet/IP configuration tool. Also, do not open the downloaded file with anything other than the EtherNet/IP configuration tool. Mitsubishi Electric recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities common to SW1DNN\\-EIPCT\\-BD and SW1DNN\\-EIPCTFX5\\-BD:* Take the above mitigation measures in RJ71EIP91 and FX5\\-ENET/IP.* Allow only trusted users to log in or remotely log in.* Make sure that no one else sneaks a peek at the screen of a user from behind while using the product.* If you leave your desk while using the product, lock your PC and prevent others from using it.* Use the PC using the product within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks or hosts.* Restrict physical access to the PC on which the product is installed as well as the PCs and network devices that can communicate with the product.* Install antivirus software on the PCs that use the product and on the PCs that can communicate with the product.* Do not open untrusted files or click on untrusted links For specific update instructions and additional details see the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory.](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2023-004_en.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.5\\.
