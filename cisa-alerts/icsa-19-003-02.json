Details about the products, affected revisions, and suggested mitigations are available in the Yokogawa Security Advisory Report YSAR\\-18\\-0008: denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Vnet/IP Open Communication Driver. Please see Yokogawa Security Advisory Report YSAR\\-18\\-0008 at the following location for more information:[https://web\\-material3\\.yokogawa.com/YSAR\\-18\\-0008\\-E.pdf](https://web-material3.yokogawa.com/YSAR-18-0008-E.pdf)  For questions related to this report and details regarding how to update to the newest revision, please visit the Yokogawa security website (registration required):[https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c\\-id\\=000498](https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c-id=000498)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
