[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryWellinTech KingView Multiple Vulnerabilities============================================ Last Revised September 02, 2014 Alert Code ICSA\\-12\\-185\\-01Overview-------- Independent researchers Carlos Mario Penagos Hollman and Dillon Beresford identified multiple vulnerabilities in WellinTech\u2019s KingView and a single vulnerability in WellinTech\u2019s KingHistorian application. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. WellinTech has created a patch and the researchers have validated that the patch resolves these vulnerabilities in the KingView and KingHistorian applications.Affected Products----------------- The following products and versions are affected:* WellinTech KingView 6\\.53, and* WellinTech KingHistorian 3\\.0\\.Impact------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service (DoS). Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- WellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control.

The WellinTech advisory and the KingView product patch can be found here: [http://www.wellintech.com/index.php/news/33\\-patch\\-for\\-kingview653](http://www.wellintech.com/index.php/news/33-patch-for-kingview653)  . The WellinTech advisory and the KingHistorian product patch can be found here: [http://en2\\.wellintech.com/products/detail.aspx?contentid\\=25](http://en2.wellintech.com/products/detail.aspx?contentid=25)  . ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, https://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/Recommended\\-Practices, Web site last accessed July 3, 2012\\. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
