These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. WellinTech has created a patch and the researchers have validated that the patch resolves these vulnerabilities in the KingView and KingHistorian applications.\nAffected Products\nThe following products and versions are affected:\n\nWellinTech KingView 6.53, and\nWellinTech KingHistorian 3.0.\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service (DoS).\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nWellinTech is a software development company specializing in automation and control. WellinTech is based in Beijing, China, with branches in the United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan.\nAccording to the WellinTech Web site, the KingView product is a Windows-based control, monitoring, and data collection application deployed across several industries, including power, water, building automation, mining, and other sectors. The KingHistorian product is a database that can be used as a stand-alone historian; it is deployed across several industries including water and power and other sectors.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview-Kingview Application\n\nStack-based Buffer OverflowCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html , Web site last accessed July 3, 2012.\n\nBy sending a specially crafted packet to Port 555/TCP, an attacker may create a stack-based buffer overflow in the KingView application.

The WellinTech advisory and the KingView product patch can be found here: http://www.wellintech.com/index.php/news/33-patch-for-kingview653. The WellinTech advisory and the KingHistorian product patch can be found here: http://en2.wellintech.com/products/detail.aspx?contentid=25.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Recommended-Practices, Web site last accessed July 3, 2012. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
