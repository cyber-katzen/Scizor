[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryOpen Design Alliance Drawing SDK================================ Release Date December 19, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-353\\-04**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Open Design Alliance (ODA)* **Equipment**  : Drawing SDK* **Vulnerabilities**  : Use after Free, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ODA Drawing SDK.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of ODA Drawing SDK are affected:* Drawing SDK: Versions prior to 2024\\.1### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Open Design Alliance's Drawing SDK prior to Version 2024\\.1 is vulnerable to a use after free attack. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific vulnerability exists within the parsing of DWG files. Crafted data in a DWG file can trigger a use after free attack past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-26495](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26495)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)** Parsing of DWG files in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2023\\.6 lacks proper validation of the length of user\\-supplied XRecord data prior to copying it to a fixed\\-length heap\\-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-22669](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22669)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)** A heap\\-based buffer overflow exists in the DXF file reading procedure in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2023\\.6\\. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user\\-supplied XRecord data prior to copying it to a fixed\\-length heap\\-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-22670](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22670)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Mat Powell and Jimmy Calderon of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Please see [ODA security advisory 24\\.1 and 23\\.6](https://www.opendesign.com/security-advisories)  for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
