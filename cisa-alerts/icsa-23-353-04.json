EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Open Design Alliance (ODA)\nEquipment: Drawing SDK\nVulnerabilities: Use after Free, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ODA Drawing SDK.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ODA Drawing SDK are affected:\n\nDrawing SDK: Versions prior to 2024.1\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nOpen Design Alliance's Drawing SDK prior to Version 2024.1 is vulnerable to a use after free attack. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific vulnerability exists within the parsing of DWG files. Crafted data in a DWG file can trigger a use after free attack past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-26495\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.2\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nParsing of DWG files in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2023.6 lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied XRecord data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-22669\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.3 HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based buffer overflow exists in the DXF file reading procedure in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2023.6. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied XRecord data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-22670\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell and Jimmy Calderon of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPlease see\u00a0ODA security advisory 24.1 and 23.6\u00a0for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nDecember 19, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
