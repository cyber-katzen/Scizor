EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives NXG I and NXG II\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with access to the Ethernet Modbus Interface to cause a denial-of-service condition exceeding the number of available connections.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 products are affected:\n\nSINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 with NXG I control, MLFBs: 6SR2. . . -, 6SR3. . . -, 6SR4. . . -: All versions with option G28\nSINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 with NXG II control, MLFBs: 6SR2. . . -, 6SR3. . . -, 6SR4. . . -: All versions with option G28\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nSuccessful exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. An attacker with network access to the device could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the affected system.\nCVE-2019-6578 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends that affected users upgrade to NXGpro control. Please contact Siemens\u2019 customer service to obtain and install the upgrade.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nInstall a protocol bridge that isolates the networks and eliminates direct connections to the Ethernet Modbus Interface.\nApply cell protection concept and implement defense in depth.\n\nFor more information see Siemens advisory SSA-606525 located at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
