RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read data from reader configuration cards and credentials. Reader configuration cards contain credential and device administration keys which could be used to create malicious configuration cards or credentials.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following HID products are affected when configured as an encoder:\n\niCLASS SE CP1000 Encoder: All versions\niCLASS SE Readers: All versions\niCLASS SE Reader Modules: All versions\niCLASS SE Processors: All versions\nOMNIKEY 5427CK Readers: All versions\nOMNIKEY 5127CK Readers: All versions\nOMNIKEY 5023 Readers: All versions\nOMNIKEY 5027 Readers: All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nCertain configuration available in the communication channel for encoders could expose sensitive data when reader configuration cards are programmed. This data could include credential and device administration keys.\nCVE-2024-22388\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHID Global reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHID advises users to take the following steps to mitigate these threats.\nProtect your reader configuration cards.\n\nA malicious encoder or reader must be physically close to the reader configuration cards to communicate with them and extract information. Elite Key and Custom Key users that have kept their configuration cards secure should continue to be vigilant and restrict access to those cards.\n\tHID standard key users and other users who are concerned their keys may be compromised should consider steps to update the readers and credentials with new keys. To assist in this effort, HID will be introducing a free upgrade to the Elite Key program. Contact your HID representative for more information.\n\nProtect your credentials and disable legacy technologies.\n\nReading the PACS data from a credential is not enough to clone the credential for modern technologies like Seos and DESFire. These technologies use a credential key for authentication. However, if a system's readers still support legacy technologies (i.e., HID Prox, MiFARE Classic, etc.), then it may be possible to insert the credential information into a legacy technology credential that would be accepted by those readers. Users are encouraged to disable legacy credential technologies in their readers.\n\tFurther, physical credentials should always be kept safe by their users, and site managers should remind their users to be vigilant with their credentials and report missing or stolen cards.\n\nHarden your iCLASS SE Readers from configuration changes\n\niCLASS SE Readers using firmware firmware version 8.6.04 or higher can use the HID Reader Manager application to prevent the readers from accepting configuration changes from configuration cards. After this is complete, users may then securely destroy their reader configuration cards.\n\tIf you need assistance, or if the reader firmware has not been updated to 8.6.04 or higher, contact HID Technical Support.\n\nHarden your HID OMNIKEY Readers, HID iCLASS SE Reader Modules, HID iCLASS SE Processors from configuration changes\n\nContact\u00a0HID\u00a0to receive a \"Shield Card\" that will prevent further configuration changes using reader configuration cards. After this is complete, users may then securely destroy their reader configuration cards.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 6, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
