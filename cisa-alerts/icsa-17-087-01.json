The ROX I mitigation tool application note can be obtained from the Siemens support web site at the following location:\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746106\n\nRestrict access to trusted administrators only,\nApply cell protection concept,\nUse VPN for protecting network communication between cells, and\nApply Defense-in-Depth.\n\nThe mitigation tool for the affected ROX I-based products can be obtained from Siemens by doing one of the following:\n\nSubmit a support request online\n\nhttps://www.siemens.com/automation/support-request\n\nCall a local hotline center:\n\nhttps://w3.siemens.com/aspa_app/\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to the web interface at Port 10000/TCP of ROX I-based devices with appropriate mechanisms and configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-327980 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\n\nAn authenticated user could read arbitrary files through the web interface at Port 10000/TCP and access sensitive information.\nCVE-2017-2686 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\n\nThe integrated web server at Port 10000/TCP is prone to reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks if an unsuspecting user is induced to click on a malicious link.\nCVE-2017-2687 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\n\nThe integrated web server at Port 10000/TCP could allow remote attackers to perform actions with the privileges of an authenticated user, provided the targeted user has an active session and is induced to click on a malicious link or visits a malicious web site.\nCVE-2017-2688 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L).\n\nIMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\n\nAn authenticated user could bypass access restrictions in the web interface at Port 10000/TCP to obtain privileged file system access or change configuration settings.\nCVE-2017-2689 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-80\n\nThe integrated web server at Port 10000/TCP could allow an authenticated user to perform stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\nCVE-2017-6864 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nMaxim Rupp reported these vulnerabilities directly to Siemens.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Energy, Healthcare, and Transportation\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Germany\n",
