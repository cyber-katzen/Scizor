For the most up\\-to\\-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services \\| Services \\| Siemens Global)](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications)  .**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Polarion ALM* **Vulnerability:**  Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform host header injection attacks.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Siemens Polarion ALM, an application lifecycle management software, are affected:* All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS IN OUTPUT USED BY A DOWNSTREAM COMPONENT ('INJECTION') CWE\\-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)** The affected application contains a host header injection vulnerability that could allow an attacker to spoof host header information and redirect users to malicious websites.[CVE\\-2022\\-46265](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-46265)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Pongsathon Sirithanyakul, Juttikhun Jirathanan, and Warunyou Sunpachit of IT Select Lab reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* In the product\u2019s Apache HTTP Server configuration, check *\u201cpolarion.conf\u201d*  or *\u201cpolarion\\-cluster.conf\u201d*  for the below misconfiguration:*\u201cRedirectMatch permanent ^/$ /polarion/\u201d*  which must be changed to *\u201cRedirectMatch permanent \"^/$\"https://\\<their\\-polarion\\-host\\-here\\>/polarion/\u201d*  As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. \u00a0Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found [here](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information, see Siemens security advisory SSA\\-792594 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-792594.html)  or [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-792594.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
