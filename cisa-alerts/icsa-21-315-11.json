EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager\nVulnerabilities: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read sensitive data or trigger a denial-of-service condition on the application service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager, a scalable digital twin locating system, is affected:\n\nAll versions prior to v2.12\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSERTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION INTO LOG FILE CWE-532\nThe affected application writes sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, in log files. A local attacker with access to the log files could use this information to launch further attacks.\nCVE-2020-10052 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-312\nThe affected application writes sensitive data, such as database credentials, in configuration files. A local attacker with access to the configuration files could use this information to launch further attacks.\nCVE-2020-10053 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected application does not properly handle the import of large configuration files. A local attacker could import a specially crafted file, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition on the application service.\nCVE-2020-10054 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an update for the SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager and recommends users update to v2.12 or later version.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nApply security hardening of the Windows server where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed in accordance with your corporate security policies or up-to-date hardening guidelines.\nEnsure only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional local accounts on the server.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-145157\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
