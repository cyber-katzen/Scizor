EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager* **Vulnerabilities:**  Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read sensitive data or trigger a denial\\-of\\-service condition on the application service.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Siemens SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager, a scalable digital twin locating system, is affected:* All versions prior to v2\\.12### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSERTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION INTO LOG FILE CWE\\-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html) The affected application writes sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, in log files. A local attacker with access to the log files could use this information to launch further attacks.[CVE\\-2020\\-10052](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10052)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [CLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-312](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html) The affected application writes sensitive data, such as database credentials, in configuration files. A local attacker with access to the configuration files could use this information to launch further attacks.[CVE\\-2020\\-10053](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10053)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) The affected application does not properly handle the import of large configuration files. A local attacker could import a specially crafted file, which could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition on the application service.[CVE\\-2020\\-10054](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10054)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released an update for the SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager and recommends users [update to v2\\.12](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109803363)  or later version. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply security hardening of the Windows server where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed in accordance with your corporate security policies or up\\-to\\-date hardening guidelines.* Ensure only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional local accounts on the server. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-145157](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-145157.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
