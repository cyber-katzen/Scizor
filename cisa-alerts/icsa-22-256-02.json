EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Honeywell\nEquipment: SoftMaster\nVulnerabilities: Uncontrolled Search Path Element, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.\n\t\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the application permissions or escalate privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nHoneywell reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SoftMaster desktop application, a PLC software application:\u00a0\n\nSoftMaster: version 4.51\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nIf an attacker manages to trick a valid user into loading a malicious DLL, the attacker may be able to achieve code execution in the application\u2019s context and permissions.\nCVE-2022-2333 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nA local unprivileged attacker may escalate to administrator privileges, due to insecure permission assignment.\nCVE-2022-2332 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNoam Moshe of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to Honeywell.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHoneywell has released firmware update packages for the affected products on their website.\nHoneywell recommends users with potentially affected products take the following steps to protect themselves:\n\nUpdate firmware of vulnerable and affected devices.\nIsolate systems from the internet or create additional layers of defense to their system from the internet by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a demilitarized zone (DMZ).\nIf remote connections to the network are required, then users should consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located.\n\nMore information can be found in the Honeywell Security Notification SN2022-08-31 01 SoftMaster-R4.7\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\u00a0CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
