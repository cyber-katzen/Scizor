MITIGATIONS--------------- Honeywell has released firmware update packages for the affected products [on their website](https://mywebtech.honeywell.com/home)  . Honeywell recommends users with potentially affected products take the following steps to protect themselves:* Update firmware of vulnerable and affected devices.* Isolate systems from the internet or create additional layers of defense to their system from the internet by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a demilitarized zone (DMZ).* If remote connections to the network are required, then users should consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located. More information can be found in the [Honeywell Security Notification SN2022\\-08\\-31 01 SoftMaster\\-R4\\.7](https://www.security.honeywell.com/-/media/Security/Resources/PDF/Product-Warranty/Security_Notification_SN_2019-09-13-02_V4-pdf.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\u00a0CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.
