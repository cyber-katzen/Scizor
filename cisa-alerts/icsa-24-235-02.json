EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: 5015 - AENFTXT\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rockwell Automation 5015 - AENFTXT, a part of the FLEXHA 5000 I/O Modules, are affected:\n\n5015 - AENFTXT: Version 2.011\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Improper Input Validation CWE-20\nAn input validation vulnerability exists in the affected products when a manipulated PTP packet is sent, causing the secondary adapter to result in a major nonrecoverable fault. If exploited, a power cycle is required to recover the product.\nCVE-2024-6089 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-6089. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation encourages users of the affected software to apply the following risk mitigations, if possible:\n\nUpdate to the corrected firmware revision, v2.012.\nFor information on how to mitigate Security Risks on industrial automation control systems, Rockwell Automation encourages users to implement suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of the vulnerability.\n\nUsers can use Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization to generate more environment-specific prioritization.\nFor more information see the Rockwell Automation Security Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
