EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.1\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SCALANCE X Switches\nVulnerability: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-19-162-04 Siemens SCALANCE X (Update A) that was published January 14, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to reconstruct passwords for users of the affected devices, if the attacker is able to obtain a backup of the device configuration.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens SCALANCE X products are affected by this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE X-200 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions prior to v5.2.4\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2\u00a0--------\n\n\n\nSCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions\u00a0prior to v5.5.0\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 2\u00a0---------\n\nSCALANCE X-300 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions prior to v4.1.3\nSCALANCE X-414-3E: all versions\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE-257\nThe affected devices store passwords in a recoverable format. An attacker may extract and recover device passwords from the device configuration. Successful exploitation requires access to a device configuration backup and impacts confidentiality of the stored passwords.\nCVE-2019-6567 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nChristopher Wade from Pen Test Partners coordinated disclosure with Siemens; Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA. Artem Zinenko from Kaspersky reported that SIPLUS should also be mentioned.\n\u00a0\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds/mitigations to reduce the risk from this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\nSCALANCE X-200 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v5.2.4\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2\u00a0---------\n\nSCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v5.5.0 or later version\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2\u00a0---------\n\n\n\nSCALANCE X-300 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v4.1.3\u00a0or later version\nSCALANCE X-414-3E: Migrate to the SCALANCE XM-400 product line\n\nUntil additional updates are available, Siemens recommends users apply the following workarounds/mitigations to reduce the risk from this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\nRestrict access to configuration backups or archived device configuration data.\nRestrict or disable network access to mechanisms that allow retrieval of device configuration, if enabled.\nRestrict access to device configuration module C-PLUG\u00a0if in use.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact Siemens ProductCERT.\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-646841\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
