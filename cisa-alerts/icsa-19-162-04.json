EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.1*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SCALANCE X Switches* **Vulnerability:**  Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the advisory update titled ICSA\\-19\\-162\\-04 Siemens SCALANCE X (Update A) that was published January 14, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to reconstruct passwords for users of the affected devices, if the attacker is able to obtain a backup of the device configuration.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens SCALANCE X products are affected by this vulnerability:* SCALANCE X\\-200 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions prior to v5\\.2\\.4**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2\u00a0\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE X\\-200IRT switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions\u00a0prior to v5\\.5\\.0**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 2\u00a0\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE X\\-300 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): all versions prior to v4\\.1\\.3* SCALANCE X\\-414\\-3E: all versions### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [STORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE\\-257](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/257.html) The affected devices store passwords in a recoverable format. An attacker may extract and recover device passwords from the device configuration. Successful exploitation requires access to a device configuration backup and impacts confidentiality of the stored passwords.[CVE\\-2019\\-6567](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6567)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Christopher Wade from Pen Test Partners coordinated disclosure with Siemens; Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA. Artem Zinenko from Kaspersky reported that SIPLUS should also be mentioned.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds/mitigations to reduce the risk from this vulnerability:* SCALANCE X\\-200 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v5\\.2\\.4](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109767965)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2\u00a0\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE X\\-200IRT switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v5\\.5\\.0](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109792534/)  or later version**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 2\u00a0\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE X\\-300 switch family (including SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v4\\.1\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109773547)  or later version* SCALANCE X\\-414\\-3E: Migrate to the SCALANCE XM\\-400 product line Until additional updates are available, Siemens recommends users apply the following workarounds/mitigations to reduce the risk from this vulnerability:* Restrict access to configuration backups or archived device configuration data.* Restrict or disable network access to mechanisms that allow retrieval of device configuration, if enabled.* Restrict access to device configuration module C\\-PLUG\u00a0if in use. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
