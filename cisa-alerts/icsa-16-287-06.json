[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryFATEK Automation Designer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities=========================================================== Last Revised April 08, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-287\\-06OVERVIEW-------- Ariele Caltabiano (kimiya) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) has identified a heap memory corruption and two stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Fatek\u2019s Automation PM and FV Designer applications. Fatek has not produced an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities. ZDI has coordinated with NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT. ZDI has published the PM Designer vulnerability. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following FATEK Automation products are affected:* Automation PM Designer V3 Version 2\\.1\\.2\\.2, and* Automation FV Designer Version 1\\.2\\.8\\.0IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of the reported vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to perform a number of malicious actions including denial of service and arbitrary code execution. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Fatek is a Taiwan\\-based company that maintains distribution offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, India, Germany, France, Czech Republic, China, and Australia. The affected products, Automation PM Designer and Automation FV Designer, are HMI programming software. According to Fatek, these products are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities and Critical Manufacturing. Fatek estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe and Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE\\-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, web site last accessed October 13, 2016\\.

ZDI has published the PM Designer vulnerability. It is available at:[http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI\\-16\\-525/](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-525/)  . ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
