EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-182-01 Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft that was published June 30, 2020, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read/modify information, execute arbitrary code, and/or crash the application.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DOPSoft, a Human Machine Interface (HMI) editing software, are affected:\n\nDOPSoft Version 4.00.08.15 and prior\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nMultiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, which may allow an attacker to read information and/or crash the application.\nCVE-2020-10597 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nOpening a specially crafted project file may overflow the heap, which may allow remote code execution, disclosure/modification of information, or cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2020-14482 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson), working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nDelta recommends the following:\n\nUpdate to the latest version of DOPSoft v4.00.08.21\nRestrict interaction of the application with trusted files.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect against social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
