The agency reported the activity to Microsoft and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Microsoft determined that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data.\n \n\n\n\n CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide guidance to critical infrastructure organizations on enhancing monitoring of Microsoft Exchange Online environments. Organizations can enhance their cyber posture and position themselves to detect similar malicious activity by implementing logging recommendations in this advisory. Organizations that identify suspicious, anomalous activity should contact Microsoft for proceeding with mitigation actions due to the cloud\\-based infrastructure affected, as well as report to CISA and the FBI.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-193A Enhanced Monitoring to Detect APT Activity Targeting Outlook Online](/sites/default/files/2023-07/aa23-193a_joint_csa_enhanced_monitoring_to_detect_apt_activity_targeting_outlook_online_2.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 410\\.82 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n In Mid\\-June 2023, an FCEB agency observed\n `MailItemsAccessed` \n events with an unexpected\n `ClientAppID` \n and\n `AppID` \n in M365 Audit Logs. The\n `MailItemsAccessed` \n event is generated when licensed users access items in Exchange Online mailboxes using any connectivity protocol from any client. The FCEB agency deemed this activity suspicious because the observed\n `AppId` \n did not normally access mailbox items in their environment. The agency reported the activity to Microsoft and CISA.\n \n\n\n\n**(Updated July 14, 2023\\)** \n Microsoft determined that APT actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data from a small number of accounts. The APT actors used a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer key to forge tokens to impersonate consumer and enterprise users. Microsoft remediated the issue by first blocking tokens issued with the acquired key and then replacing the key to prevent continued misuse.\u00a0Microsoft determined that this activity was part of a campaign targeting multiple organizations (all of which have been notified by Microsoft).\u00a0\\[\n [1](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/microsoft-mitigates-china-based-threat-actor-storm-0558-targeting-of-customer-email/) \n ]\n \n\n\n\n The affected FCEB agency identified suspicious activity by leveraging enhanced logging\u2014specifically of\n `MailItemsAccessed` \n events\u2014and an established baseline of normal Outlook activity (e.g., expected\n `AppID` \n ). The\n `MailItemsAccessed` \n event enables detection of otherwise difficult to detect adversarial activity.\n \n\n\n\n CISA and FBI are not aware of other audit logs or events that would have detected this activity. Critical infrastructure organizations are strongly urged to implement the logging recommendations in this advisory to enhance their cybersecurity posture and position themselves to detect similar malicious activity.\n \n\n\n### **LOGGING**\n\n\n\n CISA and the FBI strongly encourage critical infrastructure organizations to ensure audit logging is enabled.\n **Note:** \n Per CISA\u2019s\n [Microsoft Exchange Online Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baselines](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft Exchange Online M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Exchange Online Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n , FCEB agencies shall enable audit logging. These minimum viable secure configuration baselines are part of CISA\u2019s\n [Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Project](/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project \"Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Project\") \n , which provides guidance for FCEB agencies securing their cloud business application environments and protecting federal information created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. Although tailored to FCEB agencies, the project provides security guidance applicable to all organizations with cloud environments. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M\\-21\\-31 requires Microsoft audit logs be retained for at least twelve months in active storage and an additional eighteen months in cold storage. This can be accomplished either by offloading the logs out of the cloud environment or natively through Microsoft by creating an audit log retention policy.\n \n\n\n\n In addition to enabling audit logging, CISA and FBI strongly encourage organizations to:\n \n\n\n* **Enable Purview Audit (Premium) logging.** \n This logging requires licensing at the G5/E5 level. See Microsoft\u2019s guidance on\n [Assigning Microsoft 365 Licenses to Users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide \"Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to users\") \n for additional information.\n* **Ensure logs are searchable by operators.** \n The relevant logs need to be accessible to operational teams in a platform (e.g., security operations center \\[SOC] tooling) that enables hunting for this activity and distinguishing it from expected behavior within the environment.\n* **Enable Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Logging (UAL).** \n UAL should be enabled by default, but organizations are encouraged to validate these settings.\n* **Understand your organization\u2019s cloud baseline.** \n Organizations are encouraged to look for outliers and become familiar with baseline patterns to better understand abnormal versus normal traffic.\n\n\n### **GENERAL CLOUD MITIGATIONS**\n\n\n\n All mitigation actions for this activity are the responsibility of Microsoft due to the cloud\\-based infrastructure affected; however, CISA and the FBI recommend that critical infrastructure organizations implement the following to harden their cloud environments. Although, these mitigations will not prevent this or related activity where actors leverage compromised consumer keys, they will reduce the impact of less sophisticated malicious activity targeting cloud environments.\n **Note:** \n These mitigations align with CISA\u2019s\n [SCuBA Technical Reference Architecture (TRA)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/SCuBA_TRA_RFC_EG_508c.pdf \"Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Technical Reference Architecture (TRA)\") \n , which describes essential components of security services and capabilities to secure and harden cloud business applications, including the platforms hosting the applications.\n \n\n\n* **Apply CISA\u2019s recommended baseline security configurations** \n for Microsoft\n [Defender for Office 365](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft 365 Defender M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft 365 Defender Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [Azure Active Directory](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft Azure Active Directory M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Azure Active Directory M365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [Exchange Online](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft Exchange Online M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Exchange Online Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [OneDrive for Business](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft OneDrive for Business M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft OneDrive for Business Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [Power BI](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft%20Power%20BI%20M365%20Minimum%20Viable%20SCB%20v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Power BI M365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [Power Platform](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft%20Power%20Platform%20M365%20Minimum%20Viable%20SCB%20Draft%20v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Power Platform M365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n ,\n [SharePoint Online](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft SharePoint Online M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft SharePoint Online M365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n , and\n [Teams](/sites/default/files/publications/Microsoft Teams M365 Minimum Viable SCB Draft v0.1.pdf \"Microsoft Teams M365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baseline Draft Version 0.1\") \n \\[\n [SCuBA TRA Section 6\\.6](/sites/default/files/2022-12/SCuBA_TRA_RFC_EG_508c.pdf \"TLP:WHITE Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Technical Reference Architecture (TRA)\") \n ].\n* **Separate administrator accounts from user accounts** \n according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) guidance,\n [AC\\-5: Separation of Duties](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf \"Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations\") \n .
