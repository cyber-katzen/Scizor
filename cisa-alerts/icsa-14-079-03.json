ZDI reported them to NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT. Advantech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Advantech WebAccess versions are affected:\nWebAccess Version 7.1 and previous.\nIMPACT\nAn attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code and view contents of files stored on the target machine.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdvantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.\nAdvantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, and government facilities. These systems are deployed globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSQL INJECTIONCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014.\n\nAn attacker using SQL injection may use arguments to construct queries without proper sanitization. The DBVisitor.dll is exposed through SOAP interfaces, and the exposed functions are vulnerable to SOAP injection. This may allow unexpected SQL action and access to records in the table of the software database or execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2014-0763NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0763, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014.\n\nSTACK BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014.\n\nBy providing an overly long string to the NodeName parameter, an attacker may be able to overflow the static stack buffer. The attacker may then execute code on the target device remotely.\nCVE-2014-0764NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0764, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014.\n\n\n\nSTACK BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker sends data from the GotoCmd argument to control. If the value of the argument is overly long, the static stack buffer can be overflowed. This will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.\nCVE-2014-0765NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0765, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

This will overflow the static stack buffer. The attacker may then execute code on the target device remotely.\nCVE-2014-0767NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0767, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

The URLs are accessed in the security context of the current browser session. The control does not perform any URL validation and allows \u201cfile://\u201d URLs that access the local disk.\nThe method can be used to open a URL (including file URLs) and read file URLs through JavaScript. This method could also be used to reach any arbitrary URL to which the browser has access.\nCVE-2014-0771NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0771, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

After validation, the values supplied in the HTML are passed to the Windows CreateProcessA API.\nThe validation can be bypassed allowing for running arbitrary command lines. The command line can specify running remote files (example: UNC command line).\nA function exists at offset 100019B0 of bwocxrun.ocx. Inside this function, there are 3 calls to strstr to check the contents of the user specified command line. If \u201c\\setup.exe,\u201d \u201c\\bwvbprt.exe,\u201d or \u201c\\bwvbprtl.exe\u201d are contained in the command line (strstr returns nonzero value), the command line passes validation and is then passed to CreateProcessA.\nCVE-2014-0773NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0773, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Users may download this version from the following location at their web site:\nhttp://webaccess.advantech.com/downloads.php?item=software\nFor additional information about WebAccess, please visit the following Advantech web site:\nhttp://webaccess.advantech.com/\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (www.ics-cert.org).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
