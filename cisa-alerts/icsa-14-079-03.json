[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAdvantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities=================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-079\\-03OVERVIEW-------- This advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled \u201cICSA\\-14\\-079\\-03P Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities\u201d that was posted to the US\\-CERT secure Portal library March\u00a020,\u00a02014\\. Researchers working with HP\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), Andrea Micalizzi, aka rgod, Tom\u00a0Gallagher, and an independent anonymous researcher, have identified several vulnerabilities in Advantech\u2019s WebAccess application. ZDI reported them to NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT. Advantech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Advantech WebAccess versions are affected: WebAccess Version 7\\.1 and previous.IMPACT------ An attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code and view contents of files stored on the target machine. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Advantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide. Advantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web\\-based SCADA and human\\-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, and government facilities. These systems are deployed globally.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### SQL INJECTIONCWE\\-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89\\.html, web site last accessed March\u00a0 20, 2014\\. An attacker using SQL injection may use arguments to construct queries without proper sanitization. The DBVisitor.dll is exposed through SOAP interfaces, and the exposed functions are vulnerable to SOAP injection. This may allow unexpected SQL action and access to records in the table of the software database or execution of arbitrary code.

CVE\\-2014\\-0772NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-0772, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March 20, 2014\\.### COMMAND INJECTIONCWE\\-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'),\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77\\.html, web site last accessed March 20, 2014\\. The BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1 control contains a method named \u201cCreateProcess.\u201d This method contains validation to ensure an attacker cannot run arbitrary command lines. After validation, the values supplied in the HTML are passed to the Windows CreateProcessA API. The validation can be bypassed allowing for running arbitrary command lines. The command line can specify running remote files (example: UNC command line). A function exists at offset 100019B0 of bwocxrun.ocx. Inside this function, there are 3 calls to strstr to check the contents of the user specified command line. If \u201c\\\\setup.exe,\u201d \u201c\\\\bwvbprt.exe,\u201d or \u201c\\\\bwvbprtl.exe\u201d are contained in the command line (strstr returns nonzero value), the command line passes validation and is then passed to CreateProcessA.
