EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely, low attack complexity\nVendor: Cognex\nEquipment: 3D-A1000 Dimensioning System\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, Client-side Enforcement of Server-side Security\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized password changes, escalation of privileges, falsifying of password logs, and bypassing of web access controls.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Cognex 3D-A1000 Dimensioning System, an industrial smart camera, are affected:\n\nCognex 3D-A1000 Dimensioning System: Firmware Version: 1.0.3 (3354) and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCITON CWE-306\nThe affected product allows unauthorized users to change the operator account password via webserver commands by monitoring web socket communications from an unauthenticated session. This could allow an attacker to escalate privileges to match those of the compromised account.\nCVE-2022-1368 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IMPROPER OUTPUT NEUTRALIZATION FOR LOGS CWE-117\nThe affected product allows an attacker to create false logs that show the password as having been changed when it is not, complicating forensics.\nCVE-2022-1522 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIENT-SIDE ENFORCEMENT OF SERVER-SIDE SECURITY CWE-602\nAttackers could bypass web access controls by inspecting and modifying the source code of password protected web elements.\nCVE-2022-1525 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Transportation\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTri Quach, Shanil Prasad, Brandon Park, and Nishith Sinha reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCognex has reportedly fixed these issues in release 1.2 PR2. For more information, users should contact Cognex support (login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
