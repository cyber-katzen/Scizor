MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released update V8.10.0.6 for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest version.\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nRestrict the command line interface and web-based management interfaces to a dedicated layer 2 segment/VLAN and/or control\u00a0them by firewall policies at layer 3 and above.\nBlock access to port UDP/8211 from untrusted networks.\nEnable cluster-security via the cluster-security command.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-843070 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
