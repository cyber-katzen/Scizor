Credentials are BD managed and are not visible to or used by customers to access or use BD Pyxis devices.[CVE\\-2022\\-22766](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-22766)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER BD voluntarily reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- BD is in the process of strengthening credential management capabilities in BD Pyxis devices. Additionally, BD recommends the following compensating controls for users of BD Pyxis products that utilize the hard\\-coded credentials:* Limit physical access to the device to only authorized personnel.* Tightly control management of BD Pyxis system credentials provided to authorized users.* Isolate affected products in a secure VLAN or behind firewalls with restricted access that only permits communication with trusted hosts in other networks when needed.* Monitor and log all network traffic attempting to reach the affected products for suspicious activity.* Work with a BD support team to ensure all patching and virus definitions are up to date. The Pyxis Security Module for automated patching and virus definition management is provided to all accounts. For more information on this issue, please see the associated [BD product security bulletin](https://cybersecurity.bd.com/bulletins-and-patches/bd-pyxis-products-hardcoded-credentials)  on the BD website.
