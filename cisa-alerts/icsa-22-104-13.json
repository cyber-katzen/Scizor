  "markdown": "\nAs of January 10, 2023, CISA will no longer be updating ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities beyond the initial advisory. For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU GNU/Linux subsystem\nVulnerabilities: Use of Unmaintained Third-party Components\n\n2. UPDATE\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled \u201cICSA-22-104-13 Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU GNU/Linux subsystem\u201d published April 14, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed; a buffer overflow condition may allow remote code execution.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the GNU/Linux subsystem of the following products:\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU 1518(F)-4 PN/DP MFP (incl. SIPLUS variant): firmware version V3.0\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU 1518(F)-4 PN/DP MFP (incl. SIPLUS variant): firmware version V2.9.4\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU 1518(F)-4 PN/DP MFP (incl. SIPLUS variant): firmware version V2.9.3\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF UNMAINTAINED THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS CWE-1104\nGNU/Linux vulnerabilities have been identified. For a full list of the identified vulnerabilities, please see Siemens SSB-439005\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens is working on an update for the latest firmware version, and recommends the following mitigations:\n\nApply defense-in-depth.\nOnly build and run applications from trusted sources.\n\nFor more information about these vulnerabilities and the associated mitigations, please see SSB-439005\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
