Siemens has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities. Siemens has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute privileged commands using an unprivileged account. This could affect multiple industries, including food and beverage, water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical sectors worldwide.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSCALANCE X204IRT versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X204IRT PRO versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X202-2IRT versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X202-2P IRT versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X202-2P IRT PRO versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X201-3P IRT versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X201-3P IRT PRO versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE X200-4P IRT versions < V5.1.0\nSCALANCE XF204IRT versions < V5.1.0\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in an attacker executing privileged commands using an unprivileged account.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors.\nScalance X switches are used to connect industrial components like PLCs or HMIs. These switches have a Web interface to enable administrators to change the configuration using a common Web browser.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLSCWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013.\n\nThe Scalance X200 IRT user privileges for the Web interface are verified properly on the client side but not properly verified on the server side. This could allow the attacker to execute privileged commands using an unprivileged account.\nCVE-2013-3633NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-3633, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.0 has been assigned by the vendor; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:C, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013.\n\nPERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLSa\n\nThe Scalance SNMPv3 does not properly check user credentials. This could allow the attacker to execute privileged SNMP commands while only having unprivileged credentials.\nCVE-2013-3634NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-3634, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned by the vendor; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has produced a software update, Scalance X-200IRT V5.1.0 that resolves these vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends that asset owners and operators contact Siemens customer support to acquire the update.\nSiemens update information is located here:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/73470284\nSiemens security advisory is located here:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-170686.pdf\nSiemens suggests that if it is not possible to install the update, a workaround for CVE-2013-3634 is either to disable SNMP or to completely disable any read-write access.\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, , http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed June 18, 2013. that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
