A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING REQUIRED CRYPTOGRAPHIC STEP CWE-325\nA missing secure communication definition and an incomplete TLS validation in the upgrade service in B&R Automation Studio enable unauthenticated users to perform MITM attacks via the B&R upgrade server.\nCVE-2019-19101 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nA directory traversal vulnerability in SharpZipLib used in the upgrade service in B&R Automation Studio allow unauthenticated users to write to certain local directories. The vulnerability is also known as \u201czip slip.\u201d\nCVE-2019-19102 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Austria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYehuda Anikster and Amir Preminger of Claroty\u00a0reported these vulnerabilities to B&R Industrial Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nB&R recommends applying product updates at the earliest convenience. Users of Automation Studio Versions 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x are advised to upgrade to a newer version of Automation Studio.\n\nThe upgrade service now operates with reduced privileges. Additionally, the deletion process is restricted to Automation Studio downloaded files and directories.\nB&Rs upgrade server now serves HTTPS links in the configuration files. Additionally, Microsoft .NET Framework certificate checks are now being used in the Automation Studio upgrade service.\nAutomation Studio 4.3 and later should be switched from the SharpZipLib to the .NET Framework, provided native ZIP archive implementation. For these versions the issue is not reproducible. For prior versions of Automation Studio, it is recommended to update the installation.\n\nB&R recommends the following workarounds until users can upgrade to a newer version:\n\nAccess to zip archives is controlled and access of the zip archive is limited to trusted parties only.\nChecksums may be used to detect tampering of zip archives, e.g., transferring them between different contexts.\nIt is possible to manually adjust the permissions of the Automation Studio upgrade. Access to the Automation Studio installation and the device it is used on should be restricted.\n\nUsers may approach their local B&R service organization in case of questions.\nFor more information related to these vulnerabilities, please refer to the B&R advisory.\nFor additional information and support, please contact B&R service.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
