EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: GE\nEquipment: PACSystems CPE305/310, CPE330, CPE400, RSTi-EP CPE 100, CPU320/CRU320, RXi\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the device to reboot and change its state, causing the device to become unavailable.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PACSystems, an industrial Internet controller, are affected:\n\nPACSystems RX3i CPE305/310 version 9.20 and prior,\nRX3i CPE330 version 9.21 and prior,\nRX3i CPE 400 version 9.30 and prior,\nPACSystems RSTi-EP CPE 100 all versions, and\nPACSystems CPU320/CRU320 and RXi all versions.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe device does not properly validate input, which could allow a remote attacker to send specially crafted packets causing the device to become unavailable.\nCVE-2018-8867 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: USA\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGE has released the following firmware to mitigate the vulnerability (login required):\nIC695CPE305 \u2013 https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/IC695CPE305-PACSystems-RX3i-CPU-DN \u2013 Upgrade Kit: CPE305_FW9_40_41G1733-MS10-000-A17.zip\nIC695CPE310 \u2013 https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/IC695CPE310-PACSystems-RX3i-CPU-DN \u2013 Upgrade Kit: CPE310_FW9_40_41G1734-MS10-000-A17.zip\nIC695CPE330 \u2013 https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/IC695CPE330-PACSystems-RX3i-CPU-DN \u2013 Upgrade Kit: CPE330_FW9_40_41G2016-FW01-000-A11.zip\nIC695CPE400 \u2013 https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/IC695CPE400-PACSystems-RX3i-Rackless-CPU-with-Field-Agent \u2013 Upgrade Kit: CPE400_FW9_40_41G2376-FW01-000-A3.zip\nFor CPE100 the newest firmware can be obtained through the following link:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/EPSCPE100-RSTi-EP-CPU-Firmware\nGE reports that CPU/CRU320 is end of life, and there is a direct upgrade path available to users.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
