Software updates can be downloaded from Schneider Electric\u2019s Ampla Support \u201cShopping Kiosk\u201d area or from the link below:\nhttp://shoppingkiosk.schneider-electric.com/doc_info.aspx?DocRef=Ampla2016R1Software&isdvd=False&df=12&gid=411131\nFor more information, users of affected products can read Schneider Electric\u2019s Ampla Security Bulletin LFSEC00000118 at the following location:\nhttp://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000118/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\n\nAmpla MES provides capability to interact with data from third party databases. When connectivity to those databases is configured to use a SQL user name and password, an attacker may be able to sniff details from the connection string.\nNote that when the third party database connectivity is configured with Windows Integrated Security as opposed to SQL username and password, the software is not vulnerable.\nCVE-2017-9637 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nINADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\n\nAmpla MES provides capability to configure users and their privileges. When Ampla MES users are configured to use Simple Security, a weakness in the password hashing algorithm could be exploited to reverse the user\u2019s password.\nNote that when Ampla MES is configured to use Windows Integrated Security as opposed to Simple Security, the software is not vulnerable.\nCVE-2017-9635 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\nRESEARCHER\nIlya Karpov from Positive Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Schneider Electric.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: France\n",
