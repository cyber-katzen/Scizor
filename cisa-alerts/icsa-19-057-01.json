A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nThe devices do not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts, which may allow an attacker to discover passwords via brute force attack.\nCVE-2019-6524 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nThe devices use plaintext transmission of sensitive data, which may allow an attacker to capture sensitive data such as an administrative password.\nCVE-2019-6526 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nFailure to properly check array bounds may allow an attacker to read device memory on arbitrary addresses, which may allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive data or cause device reboot.\nCVE-2019-6522 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNPROTECTED STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS CWE-256\nThe devices store plaintext passwords, which may allow sensitive information to be read by someone with access to the device.\nCVE-2019-6518 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PREDICTABLE FROM OBSERVABLE STATE CWE-341\nThe software generates a predictable cookie calculated with an MD5 hash, allowing an attacker to capture the administrator's password, which could lead to a full compromise of the device.\nCVE-2019-6563 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\nMoxa recommends users implement the following measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n\nInstall firmware patch. Patches may be requested from Moxa Customer Service (login required):\nSet EDS series Web configuration as \"https only\u201d to reduce predictable session ID concern.\u00a0\n\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\nPlease see Moxa\u2019s security advisory for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
