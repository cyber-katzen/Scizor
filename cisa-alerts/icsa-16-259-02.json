ABB recommends that users apply the update at their earliest convenience. Users may find more information in ABB\u2019s security advisory (ABB-VU-BUMP-089290) located on its web site at the following location:\nhttps://library.e.abb.com/public/93e52dbfd6ab4f64aa435973ccf1b6e2/9ADB005557_ABB_SoftwareVulnerabilityHandlingAdvisory_DMPro.pdf\nABB recommends security practices and firewall configurations to help protect systems from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include:\n\nCarefully inspect any files transferred between computers, including scanning them with up\u2011to\u2011date antivirus software, so that only legitimate files may be transferred.\nUser account management, appropriate authentificaton and permission management using the principle of least privilege.\n\nMore information on recommended practices can be found in the following ABB document:\n3BSE032547, Whitepaper - Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
