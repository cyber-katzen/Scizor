ABB recommends that users apply the update at their earliest convenience. Users may find more information in ABB\u2019s security advisory (ABB\\-VU\\-BUMP\\-089290\\) located on its web site at the following location:<https://library.e.abb.com/public/93e52dbfd6ab4f64aa435973ccf1b6e2/9ADB005557_ABB_SoftwareVulnerabilityHandlingAdvisory_DMPro.pdf> ABB recommends security practices and firewall configurations to help protect systems from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include:* Carefully inspect any files transferred between computers, including scanning them with up\u2011to\u2011date antivirus software, so that only legitimate files may be transferred.* User account management, appropriate authentificaton and permission management using the principle of least privilege. More information on recommended practices can be found in the following ABB document: 3BSE032547, Whitepaper \\- Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
