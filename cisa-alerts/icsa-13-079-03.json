Researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle of Cylance; Gleb Gritsai, Sergey Bobrov, Roman Ilin, Artem Chaykin, Timur Yunusov, and Ilya Karpov from Positive Technologies; and Shawn Merdinger have identified multiple vulnerabilities in Siemens WinCC TIA Portal. Siemens has produced a new software versiona that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. An attacker must use social engineering on a valid user or have user credentials.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nSiemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions:\n\nWinCC (TIA Portal) V11 (all versions).\n\nImpact\nThe vulnerabilities affect the HMI\u2019s Web server and the internal password store. Possible attacks require either physical access to the HMI or an authenticated user, so an attacker must either have valid user credentials or must use social engineering as a legitimate user. In addition, the Web server of the system must be enabled for the Web-based vulnerabilities.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors.\nSiemens WinCC TIA Portal is an HMI software package used as an interface between the operator and the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) controlling the process. It performs the following tasks: process visualization, operator control of the process, alarm display, process value and alarm archiving, and machine parameter management. This software is used in many industries, including food and beverage, water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nInsecure Password Storagehttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/261.html\nUser credentials for the HMI\u2019s Web application are stored within the HMI\u2019s system. These data are obfuscated in a reversible way and are readable and writable for users with physical access or Sm@rt Server access to the system.\nCVE-2011-4515 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).\nImproper Input ValidationCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nBy manipulating HTTP requests, an authenticated attacker may crash the HMI\u2019s Web application. The Web application will become unavailable until the device is restarted.\nCVE-2013-0669 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P).\nCross-Site ScriptingCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html , Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nThe HMI\u2019s Web application is susceptible to stored cross-site scripting attacks. An authenticated user may store data on the Web application that will execute malicious JavaScript when the affected page is accessed by other users.\nCVE-2013-0672 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nDirectory TraversalCWE-425: Direct Request, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/425.html, Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nBy manipulating the URL an authenticated attacker may have access to source code of the panel\u2019s server-side Web application files, which may include user defined scripts.\nCVE-2013-0671 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N).\nHTTP Response SplittingCWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html , Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nIf a user clicks on a malicious link that seems to lead to an HMI Web application, it is possible to display data to the user (HTTP response splitting). The attacker does not gain access to the file system.\nCVE-2013-0670 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nServer-Side Script InjectionCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nIf a user clicks on a malicious link that seems to lead to an HMI Web application, it is possible to display data to the user (server-side script injection). The attacker does not gain access to the file system.\nCVE-2013-0667 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nReflected Cross-Site ScriptingCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, Web site last accessed March 20, 2013.\nThe HMI\u2019s Web application is susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting attacks. If a legitimate user clicks on a malicious link, JavaScript code may get executed, and session information may be stolen.\nCVE-2013-0668 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. An attacker must use social engineering on a valid user or have user credentials.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low to medium skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nSiemens addressed these vulnerabilities in their security advisory titled \u201cSSA-212483: Vulnerabilities in WinCC (TIA Portal) V11.\u201dv All vulnerabilities are fixed in the new software version WinCC (TIA Portal) V12. As a workaround to close the Web-based vulnerabilities, the HMI\u2019s Web server may be disabled.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click Web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
