TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports that the following products are affected:\n \n\n\n* Siemens TeleControl Server Basic V3: versions prior to V3\\.1\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)\n\n\n\n A timing\\-based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4304) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.2** \n[**DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)\n\n\n\n The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial\\-of\\-service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4450) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.3** \n[**INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE\\-190**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)\n\n\n\n An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2\\.10\\.3\\. When parsing a multi\\-gigabyte XML document with the XML\\_PARSE\\_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-40303](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40303) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute file operations of files outside of the specified root folder. Chained with CVE\\-2022\\-43513 this could allow remote code execution.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-43514](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-43514) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.9** \n[**USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)\n\n\n\n The public API function BIO\\_new\\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_ASN1\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_CMS\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_PKCS7\\_stream, SMIME\\_write\\_ASN1, SMIME\\_write\\_CMS and SMIME\\_write\\_PKCS7\\. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\\_ASN1\\_bio\\_stream, BIO\\_new\\_CMS, BIO\\_new\\_PKCS7, i2d\\_CMS\\_bio\\_stream and i2d\\_PKCS7\\_bio\\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-0215](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0215) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.10** \n[**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n\n\n\n There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-0286](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0286) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set\\_flags() with the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_POLICY\\_CHECK flag argument.

Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH\\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a denial of service attack. The function DH\\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_ex() and EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '\\-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-3446](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3446) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

If an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non\\-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller, all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\\_64 processors supporting the AVX512\\-IFMA instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various \\- from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non\\-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20\\-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1\\.2 and 1\\.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a low severity security issue. As a workaround the AVX512\\-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\\_ia32cap: OPENSSL\\_ia32cap\\=:\\~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-4807](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-4807) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
