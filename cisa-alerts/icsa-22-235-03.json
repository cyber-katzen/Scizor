EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: mySCADA Technologies\nEquipment: mySCADA myPRO\nVulnerability: Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to run commands directly in the operating system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nmySCADA reports this vulnerability affects the following myPRO HMI/SCADA systems:\u00a0\n\nmyPRO: Versions 8.26.0 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nAn authenticated user may be able to modify parameters to run commands directly in the operating system.\nCVE-2022-2234 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Czech Republic\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMarlon Luis Petry and Michael Heinzl separately reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nmySCADA recommends users upgrade to version 8.27.0 or higher. For more information, contact mySCADA technical support. mySCADA will also send security advice by email to all registered users.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
