[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SIMATIC CP products=========================== Release Date October 12, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-285\\-01 As of January 10, 2023, CISA will no longer be updating ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities beyond the initial advisory.\u00a0For the most up\\-to\\-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services \\| Services \\| Siemens Global).](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications) **[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low Attack Complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : SIMATIC CP products* **Vulnerabilities**  : Improper Access Control, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code, access the PROFINET network without restrictions or perform denial of service attacks.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* SIMATIC CP 1604 (6GK1160\\-4AA01\\): all versions* SIMATIC CP 1616 (6GK1161\\-6AA02\\): all versions* SIMATIC CP 1623 (6GK1162\\-3AA00\\): all versions* SIMATIC CP 1626 (6GK1162\\-6AA01\\): all versions* SIMATIC CP 1628 (6GK1162\\-8AA00\\): all versions### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** The kernel memory of affected devices is exposed to user\\-mode via direct memory access (DMA) which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system as well as access the PROFINET network without any restrictions.[CVE\\-2023\\-37194](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-37194)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)** Affected devices insufficiently control continuous mapping of direct memory access (DMA) requests. This could allow local attackers to cause a denial\\-of\\-service situation on the host. A physical power cycle is required to get the system working again.[CVE\\-2023\\-37195](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-37195)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Thomas Riedmaier from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional accounts. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-784849 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-784849.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-784849.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
