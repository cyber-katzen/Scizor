EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC CP products\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code, access the PROFINET network without restrictions or perform denial of service attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC CP 1604 (6GK1160-4AA01): all versions\nSIMATIC CP 1616 (6GK1161-6AA02): all versions\nSIMATIC CP 1623 (6GK1162-3AA00): all versions\nSIMATIC CP 1626 (6GK1162-6AA01): all versions\nSIMATIC CP 1628 (6GK1162-8AA00): all versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe kernel memory of affected devices is exposed to user-mode via direct memory access (DMA) which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system as well as access the PROFINET network without any restrictions.\nCVE-2023-37194\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nAffected devices insufficiently control continuous mapping of direct memory access (DMA) requests. This could allow local attackers to cause a denial-of-service situation on the host. A physical power cycle is required to get the system working again.\nCVE-2023-37195\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThomas Riedmaier from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nEnsure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional accounts.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-784849 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nOctober 12, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
