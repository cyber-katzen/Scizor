EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Mitsubishi Electric India* **Equipment:**  GC\\-ENET\\-COM* **Vulnerability:**  Signal Handler Race Condition2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a communication error and may result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Mitsubishi Electric India Ethernet communication Extension unit GC\\-ENET\\-COM, are affected:* Mitsubishi Electric India GC\\-ENET\\-COM: Models with the beginning serial number 16XXXXXXXXX.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [SIGNAL HANDLER RACE CONDITION CWE\\-364](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/364.html)** A vulnerability exists in the Ethernet communication Extension unit (GC\\-ENET\\-COM) of GOC35 series due to a signal handler race condition. If a malicious attacker sends a large number of specially crafted packets, communication errors could occur and could result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition when GC\\-ENET\\-COM is configured as a Modbus TCP Server.[CVE\\-2023\\-1285](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1285)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  India### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Faruk Kazi and Parul Sindhwad of COE\\-CNDS lab, VJTI, Mumbai India, reported these vulnerabilities to Mitsubishi Electric India.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric India has released the following countermeasure/mitigation:* The firmware of Extension unit GC\\-ENET\\-COM where the first 2 digits of the 11\\-digit serial number starting with \u201c17\u201d have been fixed. The firmware update in Extension unit GC\\-ENET\\-COM is only available from the vendor. Users should contact a local [Mitsubishi Electric India representative](https://mitsubishielectric.in/contact-us)  . Mitsubishi Electric India recommends users take the following mitigations to minimize the risk of attackers exploiting this vulnerability if the mentioned countermeasures cannot be implemented.* Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when internet access is required.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network to restrict access from untrusted networks and hosts.* Restrict physical access to your computer and network equipment on the same network. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
