A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nCertain Linux kernels are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments.\nCVE-2018-5391 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported to CISA that these publicly known vulnerabilities also affect these products.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends applying updates, where available:\n\nRUGGEDCOM RM 1224: Update to v6.1\nRUGGEDCOM ROX II: Update to v2.13.3\nSCALANCE M-800 family: Update to v6.1\nSCALANCE S615: Update to v6.1\nSCALANCE SC-600: Update to v2.0 or later version\nSCALANCE W1700 IEEE 802.11 ac: Update to v2.0\nSCALANCE W700 IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n: Update to v6.4\nSIMATIC CP 1242-7 and 1243-1 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v3.2\nSIMATIC CP 1243-7 LTE EU & US: Update to v3.2\nSIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC: Update to v3.2\nSIMATIC CP 1542SP-1 and 1542SP-1 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v2.1\nSIMATIC 1543SP-1 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v2.1\nSIMATIC CP 1543-1 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v2.2\nSIMATIC CP 1543SP-1 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v2.1\nSINEMA Remote Connect Server: Update to v2.1\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC RF 18xC/CI: Update to v1.3 or later\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has not identified any specific mitigations or workarounds and recommends following their general security recommendations. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-377115\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
