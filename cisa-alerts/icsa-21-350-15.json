EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Simcenter STAR\\-CCM\\+ Viewer* **Vulnerability:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Write2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a crash, arbitrary code execution, or data extraction.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Simcenter STAR\\-CCM\\+ Viewer, a multiphysics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, are affected:* Simcenter STAR\\-CCM\\+ Viewer: All versions prior to 2021\\.3\\.1### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The starview\\+.exe application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing scene files. This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-42024](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42024)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Jin Huang of ADLab of Venustech reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has recommended the following:* Update to [2021\\.3\\.1 or later version](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Simcenter-STAR-CCM-Viewer-Download)* Do not open untrusted scene files from unknown sources As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
