MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions.* Solid Edge SE2022: [Update to V2210 Update12](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  or later version* Solid Edge SE2023: [Update to V2023 Update2](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  or later version Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Avoid opening untrusted X\\_B, DWG, DXF, STL, STP, SLDPRT and PAR files in Solid Edge As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. See [additional information on industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  by Siemens. For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should [contact Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  . For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-491245 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-491245.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-491245.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/document/recommended-practice-improving-industrial-control-system-cybersecurity-defense-depth)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/news-events/news/targeted-cyber-intrusion-detection-and-mitigation-strategies-update-b)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
