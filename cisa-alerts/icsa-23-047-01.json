EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 7\\.8**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Low attack complexity\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n Solid Edge\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use After Free\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n If a malicious cyber actor tricks a user into opening a malicious file with the affected applications, then the cyber actor could crash the application, extract data, or arbitrarily execute code.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports these vulnerabilities affect Solid Edge products. \u00a0See SSA\\-491245 for more information on which specific vulnerabilities affect each of the following:\n \n\n\n* Solid Edge SE2022: All versions\n* Solid Edge SE2022: All versions prior to V2210 Update12\n* Solid Edge SE2023: All versions prior to V2023 Update2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Versions of Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK prior to 2022\\.4 contain an out\\-of\\-bounds write issue while parsing specially crafted DXF files.
