EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Horner Automation\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Cscape Envision RV\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Out-of-bounds Read, Out-of-bounds Write\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to an attacker executing arbitrary code via malicious project files.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of Cscape Envision RV, a control system remote access management software, is affected:\u00a0\n\nCscape Envision RV: Version 4.60\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\n\u00a0Cscape Envision RV version 4.60 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing project (i.e. HMI) files. The product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which could result in reads past the end of allocated data structures. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0621\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nCscape Envision RV version 4.60 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing project (i.e. HMI) files. The product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which could result in writes past the end of allocated data structures. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0622\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nCscape Envision RV version 4.60 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing project (i.e. HMI) files. The product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which could result in writes past the end of allocated data structures. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0623\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHorner Automation fixed these vulnerabilities in\u00a0Version 4.70, and recommends all users update affected devices to the latest versions.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\u00a0\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
