EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC CP 343-1, SIMATIC CP 343-1Lean, SIPLUS NET CP 343-1, SIPLUS NET CP 343-1 Lean\nVulnerability: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial-of-service condition by injecting spoofed TCP RST packets.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC CP 343-1 (6GK7343-1EX30-0XE0): All versions\nSIMATIC CP 343-1 Lean (6GK7343-1CX10-0XE0): All versions\nSIPLUS NET CP 343-1 (6AG1343-1EX30-7XE0): All versions\nSIPLUS NET CP 343-1 Lean (6AG1343-1CX10-2XE0): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF SOURCE OF A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL CWE-940\nAffected products incorrectly validate TCP sequence numbers. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial-of-service condition by injecting spoofed TCP RST packets.\nCVE-2023-51440\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2023-51440. A base score of 8.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nApply network segmentation and defense-in-depth practices to reduce likelihood of a threat actor to be able to reach a potentially vulnerable device.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-516818 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
