It is available on selected Quantum programmable logic controller modules. This upgrade includes a new feature that allows the user to enable or disable both the FTP and HTTP services on the modules. Disabling these services will mitigate the vulnerability mentioned above. The following products support the HTTP and FTP service enable and disable feature:\n\n140NOE77101 Firmware Version 06.00 or greater, and\n140NOE77111 Firmware Version: 06.00 or greater.\n\n--------- End Update B Part 3 of 3 --------\nOrganizations need to evaluate the impact of removing these services prior to applying this fix. ICS\u2011CERT will provide additional information as mitigations become available for other identified vulnerabilities.\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf , Web site last accessed June 04, 2013. for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, Web site last accessed June 04, 2013.\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n\n",
