EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: EFACEC\nEquipment: UC 500\nVulnerabilities: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Open Redirect, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to the product, or redirect users to malicious websites.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of EFACEC UC 500E, a HMI, is affected:\n\nUC 500E: version 10.1.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nAn attacker with network access could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and capture sensitive information to gain unauthorized access to the application.\nCVE-2023-50703\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601\nAn attacker could construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain and could be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against application users.\nCVE-2023-50704\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nAn attacker could create malicious requests to obtain sensitive information about the web server.\nCVE-2023-50705\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nA user without administrator permissions with access to the UC500 windows system could perform a memory dump of the running processes and extract clear credentials or valid session tokens.\nCVE-2023-50706\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Multiple\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Portugal\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez of S21sec reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEFACEC has released UC 500E version 10.1.1 to mitigate this vulnerability.\nFor more information, contact\u00a0EFACEC support.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
