EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Omron\nEquipment: CX-Supervisor\nVulnerability: Use of Obsolete Function\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-318-04 Omron CX-Supervisor that was published November 14, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in information disclosure, total compromise of the system, and system unavailability.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of both \u201cFull Development\u201d and \u201cRuntime Only\u201d packages of Omron\u2019s SCADA and HMI package CX-Supervisor are affected:\n\nCX-Supervisor Versions 3.5 (12) and prior\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF OBSOLETE FUNCTION CWE-477\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nOmron CX-Supervisor ships with TeamViewer Version 5.0.8703 QS. This version of TeamViewer is vulnerable to an obsolete function vulnerability that requires user interaction to exploit. Version 5.0.8703 QS of TeamViewer is vulnerable to the items listed at the following location: Version 5.0.8703 QS TeamViewer vulnerabilities.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nCVE-2019-18251 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael DePlante of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nOmron recommends users update to CX-Supervisor Version 3.51 (9). The following link contains Omron\u2019s explanation for the changes and instructions to obtain the update: CX-Supervisor Version 3.51 (9) update.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
