UPDATE INFORMATION\n----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSMA\\-19\\-120\\-01 Philips Tasy EMR that was published April 30, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could impact or compromise patient confidentiality and system integrity. Philips\u2019 analysis has shown these issues, if fully exploited, may allow an attacker of low skill to provide unexpected input into the application, execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow of the system, and access sensitive information.\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following versions of Tasy EMR, a clinical and administrative workflow\\-based information system, are affected:\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 4 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n* Tasy EMR Versions 3\\.02\\.1744 and prior\n* Tasy WebPortal Versions 3\\.02\\.1757 and prior\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 4 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n### 4\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)\n\n\n\n The software incorrectly neutralizes user\\-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2019\\-6562](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6562) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 5 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n#### 4\\.2\\.2\n [INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE\\-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)\n\n\n\n There is an information exposure vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to access system and configuration information.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2019\\-13557](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13557) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 7 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Philips advises users to update to the most recently released versions of the product, following the Tasy EMR release schedule. Update Tasy EMR, to version 3\\.03\\.1745 or higher and update Tasy WebPortal, to version 3\\.03\\.1758 or higher.\n \n\n\n\n Philips also recommends users follow the instructions in the product configuration manual and follow market standard best practices from the application server manufacturer documentation related to security.\n \n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 7 of 7 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n Users should upgrade Service Packs as soon as possible. Hosted solutions will be patched automatically. Users running the application on premise are always alerted via release notes on changes to the system.\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.\n* Apply defense\\-in\\-depth strategies.\n* Disable unnecessary accounts and services.\n* Where additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA that can be found at the following location:\n\n\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213\\.htm](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm) \n\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) \n .
