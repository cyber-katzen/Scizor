Some of the products might not deliver SESU as part of the product package; however, SESU can be downloaded and used to manage product updates. It may also be possible more components for one product are listed in the \u201cSESU Managed Products\u201d dialog for update.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENT ENTROPY CWE\\-331](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331.html) An insufficient entropy vulnerability exists, which could cause unintended connection from an internal network to an external network when an attacker manages to decrypt the SESU proxy password from the registry.[CVE\\-2021\\-22799](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22799)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  France### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric recommends the following:* If SESU is installed (assuming SESU is configured as \u201cmanaged product\u201d inside the SESU application) it will indicate a security update is available. Click to download and install the new SESU version.* If SESU is not installed, download [SESU](https://www.seupdate.schneider-electric.com/download/SystemConsistency/SoftwareUpdate/SESU_latest_version/SESU_latest_setup_sfx.exe)  (automatic download) and follow the installation instructions. Schneider Electric strongly recommends observing the following industry cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN are only as secure as the connected devices.
