EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: PI Web API\nVulnerability: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of AVEVA PI Web API, a RESTful interface to the PI system, are affected:\n\nAVEVA PI Web API: Versions 2023 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Deserialization of Untrusted Data CWE-502\nThere is a vulnerability in AVEVA PI Web API that could allow malicious code to execute on the PI Web API environment under the privileges of an interactive user that was socially engineered to use API XML import functionality with content supplied by an attacker.\nCVE-2024-3468 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3468. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAVEVA reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Customers using affected products should apply security updates as soon as possible:\nFrom OSI Soft Customer Portal, search for \"PI Web API\" and select version \"2023 SP1\" or later.\n(Alternative) PI Web API 2021 SP3 can be fixed by upgrading PI AF Client to one of the versions specified in AVEVA Security Bulletin AVEVA-2024-004 / ICSA-24-163-03\nAVEVA further recommends users follow general defensive measures:\n\nSet \"DisableWrites\" configuration setting to true, if this instance of PI Web API is used only for reading data or GET requests.\nUninstall Core Endpoints feature if this instance of PI Web API is used only for data collection from AVEVA Adapters. Keep OMF feature installed.\nLimit AF Servers' Administrators, so that most of the PI Web API user accounts don't have the permission to change the backend AF servers.\n\nFor additional information please refer to AVEVA-2024-003\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
