EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Sierra Wireless\nEquipment: AirLink\nVulnerabilities: Infinite Loop, NULL Pointer Dereference, Cross-site Scripting, Reachable Assertion, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution to take full control of the device, steal credentials through a cross site scripting attack, or crash the device being accessed through a denial-of-service attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Sierra Wireless AirLink router with ALEOS firmware are affected:\n\nAirLink ALEOS firmware: All versions prior to 4.9.9\nAirLink ALEOS firmware: All versions prior to 4.17.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835\nLoop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') vulnerability in Sierra Wireless, Inc ALEOS could potentially allow a remote attacker to trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. This condition is cleared by restarting the device.\nCVE-2023-40458\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not adequately perform input sanitization during authentication, which could potentially result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. ACEManager recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten seconds of becoming unavailable.\nCVE-2023-40459\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not validate uploaded file names and types, which could potentially allow an authenticated user to perform client-side script execution within ACEManager, altering the device functionality until the device is restarted.\nCVE-2023-40460\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier allows an authenticated user with Administrator privileges to access a file upload field which does not fully validate the file name, creating a Stored Cross-Site Scripting condition.\nCVE-2023-40461\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nThe ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not perform input sanitization during authentication, which could potentially result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. ACEManager recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten seconds of becoming unavailable.\nCVE-2023-40462\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nWhen configured in debugging mode by an authenticated user with administrative privileges, ALEOS 4.16 and earlier store the SHA512 hash of the common root password for that version in a directory accessible to a user with root privileges or equivalent access.\nCVE-2023-40463\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nSeveral versions of ALEOS, including ALEOS 4.16.0, use a hardcoded SSL certificate and private key. An attacker with access to these items could potentially perform a man in the middle attack between the ACEManager client and ACEManager server.\nCVE-2023-40464\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities, Communications, Emergency Services, Energy, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDaniel dos Santos and Stanislav Dashevskyi of Forescout Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSierra Wireless has released the following software fixes and recommends users update their devices:\n\nAirLink ALEOS firmware:\u00a0Version 4.9.9\nAirLink ALEOS firmware:\u00a0Version 4.17.0\n\nFor more information, please see Sierra Wireless'\u00a0security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
