EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 8\\.1**\n* **ATTENTION** \n : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\n* **Vendor** \n : Sierra Wireless\n* **Equipment** \n : AirLink\n* **Vulnerabilities** \n : Infinite Loop, NULL Pointer Dereference, Cross\\-site Scripting, Reachable Assertion, Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials, Use of Hard\\-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n\n2\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution to take full control of the device, steal credentials through a cross site scripting attack, or crash the device being accessed through a denial\\-of\\-service attack.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following versions of Sierra Wireless AirLink router with ALEOS firmware are affected:\n \n\n\n* AirLink ALEOS firmware: All versions prior to 4\\.9\\.9\n* AirLink ALEOS firmware: All versions prior to 4\\.17\\.0\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE\\-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') vulnerability in Sierra Wireless, Inc ALEOS could potentially allow a remote attacker to trigger a Denial\\-of\\-Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. This condition is cleared by restarting the device.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-40458](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40458) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The ACEManager component of ALEOS 4\\.16 and earlier does not adequately perform input sanitization during authentication, which could potentially result in a Denial\\-of\\-Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router functions. ACEManager recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten seconds of becoming unavailable.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-40459](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40459) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Sierra Wireless has released the following software fixes and recommends users update their devices:\n \n\n\n* AirLink ALEOS firmware:\n [Version 4\\.9\\.9](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_reference_docs/release-notes/aleos-4,-d-,9,-d-,9-release-notes/)\n* AirLink ALEOS firmware:\n [Version 4\\.17\\.0](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_reference_docs/release-notes/aleos-4,-d-,17,-d-,0-release-notes/)\n\n\n\n For more information, please see Sierra Wireless'\n [security advisory](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/security-bulletins/sierra-wireless-technical-bulletin---swi-psa-2023-006) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n \n\n\n5\\.
