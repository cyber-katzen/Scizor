RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow unauthorized users bypass write permissions to attributes of objects.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Mendix Applications are affected:\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 7: All versions prior to v7.23.22\nMendix Applications using Mendix 8: All versions prior to v8.18.7\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: All versions prior to v9.3.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\nWrite access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has write permission to the first attribute of this object.\nCVE-2021-33718 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific mitigations and workarounds users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUpdate Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 to v7.23.22 or later\nUpdate Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 to v8.18.7 or later\nUpdate Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 to v9.3 or later\nMake the first attribute of the object non-writeable\nAdd a new read attribute and move this up to become the first in the entity attribute table\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security, and follow the recommendations in the product manual.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\u00a0\nFor more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-352521.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
