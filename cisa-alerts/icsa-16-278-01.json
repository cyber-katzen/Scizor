[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryINDAS Web SCADA Path Traversal Vulnerability============================================ Last Revised October 04, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-278\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Ehab Hussein of IOActive has identified a path traversal vulnerability in the INDAS Web SCADA application. INDAS has produced new software to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following INDAS Web SCADA versions are affected:* Web SCADA, versions prior to Version 3IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to download arbitrary files from the target system. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- INDAS is a Serbia\\-based company that does not maintain offices in other countries. The affected product, Web SCADA, is a web\\-based SCADA system. According to INDAS, Web SCADA is deployed across several sectors including Communications, and Water and Wastewater Systems. INDAS estimates that this product is used primarily in Serbia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### PATH TRAVERSALCWE\\-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22\\.html, web site last accessed October 04, 2016\\. External input is used to construct paths to files and directories without properly neutralizing special elements within the pathname that could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. CVE\\-2016\\-8343NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-8343, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed October 04, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- INDAS has produced new software, InView SCADA, that replaces Web SCADA. INDAS recommends users contact an INDAS sales representative to procure the new software. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
