EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Red Lion\nEquipment: DA50N\nVulnerabilities: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, Weak Password Requirements, Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components, Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in data compromise, data modification, and a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Red Lion DA50N, a networking gateway, are affected:\n\nDA50N: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345\nAuthorized users may install a maliciously modified package file when updating the device via the web user interface. The user may inadvertently use a package file obtained from an unauthorized source or a file that was compromised between download and deployment.\nCVE-2022-26516 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS CWE-521\nThe weak password on the web user interface can be exploited via HTTP or HTTPS. Once such access has been obtained, the other passwords can be changed. The weak password on Linux accounts can be accessed via SSH or Telnet, the former of which is by default enabled on trusted interfaces. While the SSH service does not support root login, a user logging in using either of the other Linux accounts may elevate to root access using the su command if they have access to the associated password.\nCVE-2022-1039 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF UNMAINTAINED THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS CWE-1104\nThis product relies on an outdated, unmaintained Linux kernel v4.9.119 that contains multiple vulnerabilities that may impact security.\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nA malicious actor having access to the exported configuration file may obtain the stored credentials and thereby gain access to the protected resource. If the same passwords were used for other resources, further such assets may be compromised.\nCVE-2022-27179 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRon Brash of aDolus Technology Inc. reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRed Lion notes the DA50N series product is at end-of-life and does not intend to release a software update to address these vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to apply workarounds and mitigations or upgrade their device to DA50A and DA70A.\nRed Lion has provided the following workarounds to help mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities:\n\nDo not install image files that are obtained from sources other than the official Red Lion website.\nWhen downloading images from Red Lion\u2019s website, ensure the validity of the server\u2019s TLS certificate.\nIf package files or images are to be stored before deployment, ensure they are stored in a secure manner.\nMinimize the risk of unauthorized installation via SD card by limiting physical access to the device.\nEnsure the default UI password is changed to one meeting standard security practices.\nChange the admin, rlcuser and techsup account passwords from their default values.\nDisable the SSH service and keep the telnet service disabled if they are not required.\nDo not re\u2010use the same password for securing multiple resources.\nLimit access to configuration files that contain valuable credentials.\nEnsure the use of secure credentials when configuring optional services.\nEnable only the minimum set of optional services required for the application.\n\nFor additional information, refer to Red Lion\u2019s security alert.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
