The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users run commands as privileged users according to predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker could leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed, the attack could cause a local privilege escalation, giving unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.[CVE\\-2021\\-4034](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4034)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that become larger than the threshold curl uses internally to avoid sending enormous requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error. This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match, and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on \"foo.example.com\" can set cookies that also would match for \"bar.example.com\", making it possible for a \"sister server\" to effectively cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition for a sibling site on the same second\\-level domain using this method.[CVE\\-2022\\-32205](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32205)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", forcing curl to spend enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to, and returning out of memory errors.[CVE\\-2022\\-32206](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32206)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Update all of the affected products to [v7\\.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109817007/)  or later version or the software. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens' [operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens page for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, contact the [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  . For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-419740 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-419740.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-419740.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
