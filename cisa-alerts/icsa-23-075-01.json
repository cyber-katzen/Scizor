A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that become larger than the threshold curl uses internally to avoid sending enormous requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error. This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match, and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on \"foo.example.com\" can set cookies that also would match for \"bar.example.com\", making it possible for a \"sister server\" to effectively cause a denial-of-service condition for a sibling site on the same second-level domain using this method.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32205\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability.

To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens page for Industrial Security. \u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT. \u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-419740 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
