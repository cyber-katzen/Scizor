This may allow an attacker to make device configuration changes and affect its availability.[CVE\\-2019\\-13939](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13939)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users update to the latest version of their software where applicable.* Desigo Products: [Update to v6\\.00\\.327](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109791941/)* SIMOTICS CONNECT 400: [Update to v0\\.3\\.0\\.330](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109778383)* TALON TC Series (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/109778383)* APOGEE PXC Series (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5\\.3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/109778383)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update D Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * APOGEE PXC Series (P2\\): Update to v2\\.8\\.19 or later ( [contact Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  for assistance)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update D Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Disable the DHCP client and use static IP address configuration instead (Note that the DHCP client is disabled by default on APOGEE/TALON and Desigo products).* APOGEE MEC, MBC, PXC (versions prior to v2\\.8\\.2\\): Use static IP address configuration as described above* APOGEE PXC Series and TALON TC Series products: If using a static IP address is not possible, update to the fix version listed above or contact your local Siemens office for support. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. Users are advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-162506](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-162506.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
