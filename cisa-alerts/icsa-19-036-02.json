EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: EtherNet/IP Web Server Modules\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to deny communication with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of EtherNet/IP web server module, a web server module, are affected:\n\n1756-EWEB (includes 1756-EWEBK) Version 5.001 and earlier, and\nCompactLogix 1768-EWEB Version 2.005 and earlier.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA remote attacker could send a crafted UDP packet to the SNMP service causing a denial-of-service condition to occur until the affected product is restarted.\nCVE-2018-19016 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation working with Tenable reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends that affected users disable the SNMP service if not in use.\u00a0\nFor more information please refer to the Rockwell Automation security advisory at (login required):\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1084268\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
