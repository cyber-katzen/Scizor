MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 5 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens recommends users to update to [v5\\.0\\.0 or later](https://sivms.cloud/sivms-platform/)  . Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:* General (applies to all vulnerabilities listed in this advisory) \u2013 Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the Video Servers to ensure that only legitimate systems can access the configured server ports. Harden all systems accordingly to prevent unauthorized access.* CVE\\-2019\\-18339 \\- SiNVR/SiVMS deployments with active Control Center Server (CCS) should ensure that every video server and client have the Authorization Server set to \u201cControl Center Server\u201d (Configuration \\-\\> Appearance \\-\\> Desktop \\-\\> Authorization Server).* CVE\\-2019\\-18340 \\- Harden the Video Servers to prevent local access by unauthorized users.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 5 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and to following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA\\-761617](http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  and the [PKE security advisory](https://sivms.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sivms-cve-fixes_1.0_EN.pdf)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 6 of 6 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
