Schneider Electric has not released a product to address the insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability; however, Schneider Electric has provided compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation.\nSoMachineBasic, Version 1.5, is available at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.fr/fr/download/document/SOMBASAP15SOFT/\nSchneider Electric has provided the following compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation of the insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability:\n\nVerify that the hardware and software infrastructure that the PLCs are integrated into (along with all organizational measures and rules covering access to the infrastructure) consider the results of the hazard and risk analysis, and are implemented according to best practices and standards such as ISA/IEC 62443.\nLimit traffic on the local network with managed switches\nWhere possible, avoid using Wi-Fi networks, but when Wi-Fi is essential, use only secure communications (such as WPA2 encryption)\nDo not grant [network] access to unknown computers\nWhen remote access is essential, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and ensure the remote access solution(s), as well as the remote computer(s) are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\nSchneider Electric has released Security Notifications SEVD-2017-075-01, SEVD-2017-075-02, and SEVD-2017-075-03, which provide additional information about the identified vulnerabilities, mitigations, and compensating controls:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-01/\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-02/\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-03/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPREDICTABLE VALUE RANGE FROM PREVIOUS VALUES CWE-343\n\nThe affected products generate insufficiently random TCP initial sequence numbers that may allow an attacker to predict the numbers from previous values. This may allow an attacker to spoof or disrupt TCP connections.\nCVE-2017-6030 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L).\n\nUSE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE-330\n\nThe session numbers generated by the web application are lacking randomization and are shared between several users. This may allow a current session to be compromised.\nCVE-2017-6026 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n\nINSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\n\nLog-in credentials are sent over the network with Base64 encoding leaving them susceptible to sniffing. Sniffed credentials could then be used to log into the web application.\nCVE-2017-6028 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nDavid Formby and Raheem Beyah of Georgia Tech and Fortiphyd Logic, Inc. reported the identified vulnerabilities.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector(s): Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Paris, France\n",
