RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain full access to the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration are affected:\n\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 2.5.1\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 2.5.2\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 2.5.3\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 2.6.1\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 2.11\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 3.0\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 3.2\nMAGLINK LX Web Console Configuration: version 3.3\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\nThe affected product is vulnerable to authentication bypass that could allow an unauthorized attacker to obtain user access by leveraging the MAGLINK LX Web Console.\nCVE-2023-41256\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe affected product could allow a guest user to elevate to admin privileges by leveraging the MAGLINK LX Web Console.\nCVE-2023-36497\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY (\u2018PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, which could allow an attacker to access files stored on the system.\nCVE-2023-38256\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Certified in the EU and UK, but may also be found Worldwide.\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States of America\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSoufian El Yadmani of Darktrace / CSIRT.global reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nIn 2023, Dover Fueling Solutions announced end-of-life for MAGLINK LX 3 and released MAGLINK LX 4. However, MAGLINK LX 3 version 3.4.2.2.6 and MAGLINK LX 4 fixes these vulnerabilities.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
