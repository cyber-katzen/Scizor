EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Simcenter Femap and Parasolid* **Vulnerability:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Read2\\. UPDATE---------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-22\\-195\\-09 Simcenter Femap and Parasolid (Update A) that was published July 14, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process of the application through an out\\-of\\-bounds read.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Simcenter Femap, an advanced simulation application, and Parasolid, a 3D geometric modeling tool, are affected:* Parasolid v33\\.1: All versions prior to V33\\.1\\.264* Parasolid v34\\.0: All versions prior to v34\\.0\\.250* Parasolid v34\\.1: All versions prior to v34\\.1\\.233**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Simcenter Femap V2022\\.1: All versions prior to V2022\\.1\\.3* Simcenter Femap V2022\\.2: All versions prior to V2022\\.2\\.2**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 4\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)  The affected application contains an out\\-of\\-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted NEU files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process (ZDI\\-CAN\\-15420\\).[CVE\\-2022\\-34465](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-34465)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software where available:* Parasolid V33\\.1: Update to [v33\\.1\\.264 or later](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* Parasolid V34\\.0: Update to [v34\\.0\\.250 or later](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* Parasolid V34\\.1: Update to [v34\\.1\\.233 or later](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Simcenter Femap V2022\\.1: Update to [V2022\\.1\\.3 or later](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* Simcenter Femap V2022\\.2: Update to [V2022\\.2\\.2 or later](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can implement to reduce exploitation risk:* Do not open untrusted NEU files in Simcenter Femap or Parasolid. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-243317\\.](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-243317.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
