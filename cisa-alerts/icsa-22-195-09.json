UPDATE\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-195-09 Simcenter Femap and Parasolid (Update A) that was published July 14, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process of the application through an out-of-bounds read.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Simcenter Femap, an advanced simulation application, and Parasolid, a 3D geometric modeling tool, are affected:\n\nParasolid v33.1: All versions prior to V33.1.264\nParasolid v34.0: All versions prior to v34.0.250\nParasolid v34.1: All versions prior to v34.1.233\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nSimcenter Femap V2022.1: All versions prior to V2022.1.3\nSimcenter Femap V2022.2: All versions prior to V2022.2.2\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected application contains an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted NEU files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process (ZDI-CAN-15420).\nCVE-2022-34465 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software where available:\n\nParasolid V33.1: Update to v33.1.264 or later\nParasolid V34.0: Update to v34.0.250 or later\nParasolid V34.1: Update to v34.1.233 or later\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSimcenter Femap V2022.1: Update to V2022.1.3 or later\nSimcenter Femap V2022.2: Update to V2022.2.2 or later\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can implement to\nreduce exploitation risk:\n\n\u00a0Do not open untrusted NEU files in Simcenter Femap or Parasolid.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-243317.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
