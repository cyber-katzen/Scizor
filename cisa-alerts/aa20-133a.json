Exploitation of these vulnerabilities often requires fewer resources as compared with zero\\-day exploits for which no patches are available.\n \n\n\n\n The public and private sectors could degrade some foreign cyber threats to U.S. interests through an increased effort to patch their systems and implement programs to keep system patching up to date. A concerted campaign to patch these vulnerabilities would introduce friction into foreign adversaries\u2019 operational tradecraft and force them to develop or acquire exploits that are more costly and less widely effective. A concerted patching campaign would also bolster network security by focusing scarce defensive resources on the observed activities of foreign adversaries.\n \n\n\n\n For indicators of compromise (IOCs) and additional guidance associated with the CVEs in this Alert, see the each entry within the Mitigations section below.\n [Click here](/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-133A_Top_10_Routinely_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_S508C.pdf) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\nTop 10 Most Exploited Vulnerabilities 2016\u20132019\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n U.S. Government reporting has identified the top 10 most exploited vulnerabilities by state, nonstate, and unattributed cyber actors from 2016 to 2019 as follows: CVE\\-2017\\-11882, CVE\\-2017\\-0199, CVE\\-2017\\-5638, CVE\\-2012\\-0158, CVE\\-2019\\-0604, CVE\\-2017\\-0143, CVE\\-2018\\-4878, CVE\\-2017\\-8759, CVE\\-2015\\-1641, and CVE\\-2018\\-7600\\.\n \n\n\n* According to U.S. Government technical analysis, malicious cyber actors most often exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technology. OLE allows documents to contain embedded content from other applications such as spreadsheets. After OLE the second\\-most\\-reported vulnerable technology was a widespread Web framework known as Apache Struts.\n* Of the top 10, the three vulnerabilities used most frequently across state\\-sponsored cyber actors from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are CVE\\-2017\\-11882, CVE\\-2017\\-0199, and CVE\\-2012\\-0158\\. All three of these vulnerabilities are related to Microsoft\u2019s OLE technology.\n* As of December 2019, Chinese state cyber actors were frequently exploiting the same vulnerability\u2014CVE\\-2012\\-0158\u2014that the U.S. Government publicly assessed in 2015 was the most used in their cyber operations.\n [\\[2]](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-119A) \n This trend suggests that organizations have not yet widely implemented patches for this vulnerability and that Chinese state cyber actors may continue to incorporate dated flaws into their operational tradecraft as long as they remain effective.\n* Deploying patches often requires IT security professionals to balance the need to mitigate vulnerabilities with the need for keeping systems running and ensuring installed patches are compatible with other software. This can require a significant investment of effort, particularly when mitigating multiple flaws at the same time.\n* A U.S. industry study released in early 2019 similarly discovered that the flaws malicious cyber actors exploited the most consistently were in Microsoft and Adobe Flash products, probably because of the widespread use of these technologies.\n [\\[3]](https://www.recordedfuture.com/top-vulnerabilities-2019/) \n Four of the industry study\u2019s top 10 most exploited flaws also appear on this Alert\u2019s list, highlighting how U.S. Government and private\\-sector data sources may complement each other to enhance security.\n\n\nVulnerabilities Exploited in 2020\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\n In addition to the top 10 vulnerabilities from 2016 to 2019 listed above, the U.S. Government has reported that the following vulnerabilities are being routinely exploited by sophisticated foreign cyber actors in 2020:\n \n\n\n* Malicious cyber actors are increasingly targeting unpatched Virtual Private Network vulnerabilities.\n\t+ An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Citrix VPN appliances, known as CVE\\-2019\\-19781, has been detected in exploits in the wild.\n\t+ An arbitrary file reading vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN servers, known as CVE\\-2019\\-11510, continues to be an attractive target for malicious actors.\n* March 2020 brought an abrupt shift to work\\-from\\-home that necessitated, for many organizations, rapid deployment of cloud collaboration services, such as Microsoft Office 365 (O365\\). Malicious cyber actors are targeting organizations whose hasty deployment of Microsoft O365 may have led to oversights in security configurations and vulnerable to attack.\n* Cybersecurity weaknesses\u2014such as poor employee education on social engineering attacks and a lack of system recovery and contingency plans\u2014have continued to make organizations susceptible to ransomware attacks in 2020\\.\n\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\n\n\n This Alert provides mitigations for each of the top vulnerabilities identified above. In addition to the mitigations listed below, CISA, FBI, and the broader U.S. Government recommend that organizations transition away from any end\\-of\\-life software.\n \n\n\nMitigations for the Top

Services\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\n Adversaries use known vulnerabilities and phishing attacks to compromise the security of organizations. CISA offers several free scanning and testing services to help organizations reduce their exposure to threats by taking a proactive approach to mitigating attack vectors.\n \n\n\n\n**Cyber Hygiene: Vulnerability Scanning** \n helps secure your internet\\-facing systems from weak configuration and known vulnerabilities. It also encourages organizations to adopt modern security best practices. CISA performs regular network and vulnerability scans and delivers a weekly report for your action. Once initiated, this service is mostly automated and requires little direct interaction. After CISA receives the required paperwork for Cyber Hygiene, our scans will start within 72 hours and you\u2019ll begin receiving reports within two weeks.\n \n\n\n\n**Web Application Service** \n checks your publicly accessible web sites for potential bugs and weak configurations. It provides a \u201csnapshot\u201d of your publicly accessible web applications and also checks functionality and performance in your application.\n   \n\n  \n\n If your organization would like these services or want more information about other useful services, please email\n [vulnerability\\_info@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:vulnerability_info@cisa.dhs.gov) \n .\n \n\n\nCISA Online Resources\n---------------------\n\n\n\n[The Patch Factory](/sites/default/files/publications/patch_factory_S508C.pdf) \n : CISA infographic depicting the global infrastructure for managing vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n[CISA Alert: (AA20\\-120A) Microsoft Office 365 Security Recommendations](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-120a) \n : recommendations for organizations to review and ensure their O365 environment is configured to protect, detect, and respond against would\\-be attackers.\n \n\n\n\n[CISA\u2019s Cyber Essentials](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-essentials) \n : a guide for leaders of small businesses as well as leaders of small and local government agencies to develop an actionable understanding of where to start implementing organizational cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n\n\n### Contact Information\n\n\n\n\n If you have any further questions related to this Joint Alert, please contact the FBI at either your local Cyber Task Force or FBI CyWatch.\n \n\n\n* You can find your local field offices at\n [https://www.fbi.gov/contact\\-us/field](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)\n* CyWatch can be contacted through e\\-mail at\n [cywatch@fbi.gov](mailto:cywatch@fbi.gov) \n or by phone at 1\\-855\\-292\\-3937\n\n\n\n To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at\n [central@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:central@cisa.dhs.gov \"Email CISA Central\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n### References\n\n\n\n\n[\\[1] Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/) \n\n\n[\\[2] CISA Alert (TA15\\-119A).
