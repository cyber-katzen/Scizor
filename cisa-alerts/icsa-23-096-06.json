A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nmySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior has parameters which an authenticated user could exploit to inject arbitrary operating system commands.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29169\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nmySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior has parameters which an authenticated user could exploit to inject arbitrary operating system commands.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29150\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Czech Republic\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl publicly disclosed these vulnerabilities on the internet.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nmySCADA recommends users upgrade to\u00a0version 8.29.0 or higher. For more information,\u00a0contact mySCADA technical support. mySCADA will also send security advice by email to all registered users.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\u00a0\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nKnown public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
