[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryMitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ\\-R Series======================================= Last Revised May 28, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-21\\-147\\-051\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Mitsubishi Electric* **Equipment:**  MELSEC iQ\\-R Series* **Vulnerability:**  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may prevent legitimate clients from connecting to an affected product.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following MELSEC iQ\\-R series CPU modules are affected:* R00/01/02CPU: All versions* R04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU: All versions* R08/16/32/120SFCPU: All versions* R08/16/32/120PCPU: All versions* R08/16/32/120PSFCPU: All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Due to improper session management, an attacker may prevent legitimate clients from connecting to an affected product by not properly closing a connection. If multiple MELSOFT transmission ports (TCP/IP) are open, the other ports are not affected. Sequence control is not affected by this vulnerability.[CVE\\-2021\\-20591](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20591)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Younes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigations:* Use a firewall, a virtual private network (VPN), etc., to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.* Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Use the IP filter function to restrict the connectable IP addresses. See MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User\u2019s Manual (Application) 1\\.13 Security \u201cIP filter\u201d for more information.* Use the MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP).* If Port 5007 of the MELSOFT transmission port (TCP/IP) is not used, set b2 to \"1\" in advance. See MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User\u2019s Manual (Application) Appendix 3, Buffer Memory for more information. If this vulnerability is exploited, legitimate users can recover by first disabling the port with the forced connection invalidation function and then re\\-enabling the port. For an example see MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User\u2019s Manual (Application) Appendix 3, Buffer Memory.
