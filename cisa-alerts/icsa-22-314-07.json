MITIGATIONS--------------- Omron recommends updating versions of NJ/NX\\-series machine automation controllers to address this vulnerability. These updates are available to users by contacting their [Omron or distributors](https://www.ia.omron.com/global_network/index.html)  :* NX7\\-series Machine Automation Controller (All Models): Versions 1\\.29 or higher* NX1\\-series Machine Automation Controller (All Models): Versions 1\\.50 or higher* NJ\\-series Machine Automation Controller (NJ501\\-1300, NJ501\\-1400, NJ501\\-1500\\): Versions 1\\.49 or higher* NJ\\-series Machine Automation Controller (All other Models): Versions 1\\.50 or higher Omron recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability: Enable antivirus protection:* Protect any PC with access to the control system against malware by ensuring the installation and maintenance of up\\-to\\-date commercial grade antivirus software protection. Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access:* Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks preventing untrusted devices from accessing them.* Implement firewalls by shutting down unused communications ports, limiting communications between hosts, and isolate affected systems from the IT network.* Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.* Use strong passwords and change passwords frequently.* Install physical controls that only permit authorized personnel access to control systems and equipment.* Scan USB drives or similar devices for viruses and malware to ensure the devices are safe before connecting them to systems and devices.* When possible, enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on all devices with remote access to control systems and equipment. Protect data input and output:* Perform process validation, such as backup validation or range checks, to cope with unintentional modification of input/output data to control systems and devices. Use data recovery:* Conduct periodical data backups and maintenance to prepare for potential data loss. For more information see Omron\u2019s advisory: [OMSR\\-2022\\-002](https://www.ia.omron.com/product/vulnerability/OMSR-2022-002_en.pdf)  This vulnerability and countermeasures correspond to the those reported in the CISA ICS Alert: [APT Cyber Tools Targeting ICS/SCADA Devices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a)  . CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
