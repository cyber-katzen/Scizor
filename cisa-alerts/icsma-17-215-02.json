It is advised to run the devices in a dedicated network segment and protected IT environment. If this is not possible, Siemens recommends the following:\n\nIf patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the product from the network and use in standalone mode.\nReconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system. Siemens is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much faster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore users of RUH-capable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and remaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center first and then to reconnect the systems in order to receive patches as quickly as possible via RUH. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment of system operations.\n\nIn addition, Siemens recommends:\n\nEnsure users have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.\nFor specific patch and remediation guidance information contact a local Siemens customer service engineer or a Siemens regional support center.\n\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-822184 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all medical devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
