For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.9\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Mendix Applications\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Improper Access Control\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious cyber actor to bypass XPath constraints and retrieve information using XPath queries that trigger errors.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens software is affected:\u00a0\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 7: All versions prior to V7.23.34\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 8: All versions prior to V8.18.23\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: All versions prior to V9.22.0\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.12): All versions prior to V9.12.10\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.18): All versions prior to V9.18.4\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.6): All versions prior to V9.6.15\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\u00a0\nSiemens Mendix runtime APIs allow malicious cyber actors to bypass XPath constraints and retrieve information using XPath queries that trigger errors.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23835\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions and take the appropriate action:\u00a0\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: Update to\u00a0V9.22.0 or later version\u00a0and redeploy the application\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.6): Update to\u00a0V9.6.15 or later version\u00a0and redeploy the application\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.12): Update to\u00a0V9.12.10 or later version\u00a0and redeploy the application\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9.18): Update to\u00a0V9.18.4 or later\u00a0version and redeploy the application\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 8: Update to\u00a0V8.18.23 or later version\u00a0and redeploy the application\u00a0\nMendix Applications using Mendix 7: Update to\u00a0V7.23.34 or later version\u00a0and redeploy the application\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\u00a0\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens Security Advisory SSA-252808 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
