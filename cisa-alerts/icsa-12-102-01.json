These vulnerabilities and proof of concept code were disclosed without coordination with ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity. Certec has produced an update that resolves these vulnerabilities. Mr. Auriemma has verified that the update resolves the identified vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nCertec webMI2ADS \u2013 All versions prior to Version 2.0.2 are affected.\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or could lead to data leakage.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nCertec EDV GmbH is an Austrian-based company with regional partners in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Israel.\nCertec webMI2ADS is the server component of a browser-based HMI system. WebMI2ADS is used primarily in factory and building automation.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nDirectory Traversalb. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012.\nThe web server in webMI does not implement sufficient measurers to prevent reading files from an unauthorized directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. A successful attack may result in data leakage.\nCVE-2011-4880 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5.0 has also been assigned.\nNull Pointerd. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012.\nThe web server in webMI does not implement checks on a return value from a function . An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. A successful attack would result in a DoS condition.\nCVE-2011-4881 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5.0 has also been assigned.\nTermination of the Softwaref. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012.\nAn attacker could use a non-authenticated command via the web interface on Port 80/TCP to shut down the application. A successful attack would result in a DoS condition.\nCVE-2011-4882 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5.0 has also been assigned.\nResources Consumptionh. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012.\nThe web server in webMI does not implement checks for invalid values in an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. Successful attack would result in a DoS condition.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill level may cause a DoS condition or access sensitive data.\nMitigation\nCertec has released version 2.0.2 of webMI2ADS which fixes these vulnerabilities. Customers can download version 2.0.2 of webMI2ADS.\nUsers will need to be registered in order to download the new product.\nCertec and ICS-CERT recommend that owners of vulnerable versions of the webMI2ADS product download and install the updated version as soon as possible.\nICS-CERT also encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
