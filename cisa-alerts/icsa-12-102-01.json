The web server in webMI does not implement sufficient measurers to prevent reading files from an unauthorized directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. A successful attack may result in data leakage.[CVE\\-2011\\-4880](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4880)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5\\.0 has also been assigned.#### Null Pointerd. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476\\.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012\\. The web server in webMI does not implement checks on a return value from a function . An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. A successful attack would result in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2011\\-4881](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4881)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5\\.0 has also been assigned.#### Termination of the Softwaref. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732\\.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012\\. An attacker could use a non\\-authenticated command via the web interface on Port 80/TCP to shut down the application. A successful attack would result in a DoS condition.[CVE\\-2011\\-4882](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4882)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5\\.0 has also been assigned.#### Resources Consumptionh. http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400\\.html, website last accessed April 10, 2012\\. The web server in webMI does not implement checks for invalid values in an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web server on Port 80/TCP. Successful attack would result in a DoS condition.### Vulnerability Details#### Exploitability These vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.#### Existence of Exploit Public exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.#### Difficulty An attacker with a low skill level may cause a DoS condition or access sensitive data.Mitigation---------- Certec has released version 2\\.0\\.2 of webMI2ADS which fixes these vulnerabilities. Customers can [download version 2\\.0\\.2 of webMI2ADS](http://www.atvise.com/en/atvise-downloads/products)  . Users will need to be registered in order to download the new product. Certec and ICS\\-CERT recommend that owners of vulnerable versions of the webMI2ADS product download and install the updated version as soon as possible. ICS\\-CERT also encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides [a section for control systems security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices)  on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.![]() This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.Vendor------* Certec EDV GmbH-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-12-102-01)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01) Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02) Jul 16, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01) Jul 11, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)* * [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)* * [Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
