He reported it directly to Schneider Electric who reported it to NCCIC/ICS-CERT once the problem was fixed. Schneider Electric has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability. Mr. Liimets has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Schneider Electric versions are affected:\n\n\u00a0VAMPSET, v2.2.136 and all previous versions.\n\nIMPACT\nVAMPSET software halts when trying to open a corrupted file. Even though Windows operating system remains operational, VAMPSET does not respond until the corresponding process is terminated.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, VAMPSET software, is used to configure and maintain multiple protection relays and arc monitoring units. According to Schneider Electric, this product is deployed in the Energy sector. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used on all continents, in some 60 countries world-wide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed September 11, 2014.\n\nThe vulnerability in VAMPSET is caused by opening corrupted VAMPSET setting files or disturbance recording files. This vulnerability causes VAMPSET to become halted when trying to open a corrupted file. The Windows operating system remains operational while VAMPSET does not respond until the corresponding process is terminated.\nCVE-2014-5407NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5407 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed September 11, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThe exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malformed VAMPSET setting file.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed VAMPSET setting file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nSchneider Electric released an update for distribution on August 21, 2014. The VAMPSET setting tool, v.2.2.145 or newer, can be found here:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/products/ww/en/2300-ied-user-software/2320-vamp-user-software/62050-vamp-software/\nSchneider Electric recommends that all customers and users install and use VAMPSET v.2.2.145 or newer.\nTo protect the computer and configuration files from unauthorized escalation of privileges through manipulation, Schneider Electric recommends users employ best IT practices to secure their computers and relay\u2019s configuration files and to use User Access Control (UAC) to further improve the security of the computer. Additionally, to minimize the risk of attack, users who are not directly using this software on a regular basis are strongly encouraged to delete this application from their computer to reduce the likelihood of attack and to store relay configuration files in the client\u2019s protected location.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed September 11, 2014. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed September 11, 2014. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
