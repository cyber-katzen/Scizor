EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Advantech* **Equipment:**  WebAccess/SCADA* **Vulnerability:**  Untrusted Pointer Dereference2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker gaining remote file system access and achieving remote command execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Advantech WebAccess/SCADA, a browser\\-based SCADA software package, are affected:* WebAccess/SCADA: All versions prior to 9\\.1\\.4### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-822](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/822.html)** All versions prior to 9\\.1\\.4 of Advantech WebAccess/SCADA are vulnerable to use of untrusted pointers. The RPC arguments the client sent could contain raw memory pointers for the server to use as\\-is. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the remote file system and the ability to execute commands and overwrite files.[CVE\\-2023\\-1437](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1437)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Chemical, Energy, Water and Wastewater* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Florent Saudel reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Advantech recommends all affected users update their products to the [latest patch](https://www.advantech.com/en/support/details/installation?id=1-MS9MJV)  . This vulnerability was fixed in Version 9\\.1\\.4\\. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
