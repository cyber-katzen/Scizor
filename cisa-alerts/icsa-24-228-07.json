EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 6.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Location Intelligence\nVulnerabilities: Inadequate Encryption Strength, Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, Weak Password Requirements\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read and modify data passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected product or brute force user passwords.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens Location Intelligence, a web-based application software, are affected:\n\nLocation Intelligence: All versions prior to V4.4\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nThe web server of affected products is configured to support weak ciphers by default. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker in an on-path position to to read and modify any data passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.\nCVE-2024-41681 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-41681. A base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nAffected products do not properly enforce restriction of excessive authentication attempts. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct brute force attacks against legitimate user passwords.\nCVE-2024-41682 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-41682. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3 WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS CWE-521\nAffected products do not properly enforce a strong user password policy. This could facilitate a brute force attack against legitimate user passwords.\nCVE-2024-41683 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-41683. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to the latest version:\n\nUpdate to V4.4 or later version\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-720392 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
