EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 6\\.7**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n UMC Stack\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Unquoted Search Path or Element, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Improper Input Validation\n\n\n2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION\n----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the advisory update titled ICSA\\-20\\-196\\-05 Siemens UMC Stack (Update G) that was published April 13, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a partial denial\\-of\\-service condition on the UMC component of the affected devices under certain circumstances. This could also allow an attacker to locally escalate privileges from a user with administrative privileges to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.\n \n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports that some of the vulnerabilities affect the following UMC components.
