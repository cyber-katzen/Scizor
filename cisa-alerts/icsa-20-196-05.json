EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: UMC Stack\nVulnerabilities: Unquoted Search Path or Element, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Improper Input Validation\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-20-196-05 Siemens UMC Stack (Update G) that was published April 13, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a partial denial-of-service condition on the UMC component of the affected devices under certain circumstances. This could also allow an attacker to locally escalate privileges from a user with administrative privileges to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that some of the vulnerabilities affect the following UMC components.
