This vulnerability was reported to ZDI by security researcher John Leitch. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following InduSoft Web Studio version is affected:\n\nWeb Studio Version 7.1\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of the reported vulnerability could allow an attacker to read files outside the web root and possibly perform arbitrary code execution. These actions can result in adverse application conditions and ultimately impact the production environment on which the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is used.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nInduSoft is based in Austin, Texas.\nInduSoft Web Studio is a collection of automation tools to develop human-machine interfaces, SCADA systems, and embedded instrumentation systems.\nInduSoft Web Studio is often integrated as a third-party component in other vendors\u2019 products. According to InduSoft, Web Studio is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, and Water and Wastewater Systems.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPATH TRAVERSALCWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (\u2018Path Traversal\u2019), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, web site last accessed April 24, 2014.\n\nThe NTWebServer (test web server installed with InduSoft Web Studio) contains a flaw that enables a malicious user to read files outside the web root. This can be exploited to read APP files that may contain application passwords. It may be possible to achieve remote code execution by exfiltrating credentials for Web Studio itself, then using them to remotely administer the targeted instance to deploy attacker controlled server-side code.\nCVE-2014-0780NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0780, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P.CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed April 24, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nInduSoft did not intend for this web server to be used in real applications. It was provided as demonstration/training software (as stated in user manuals). They have created a mitigation for this vulnerability in InduSoft Web Studio v7.1+Service Pack 2+ Patch 4. Users may obtain this patch at the following location (you must be logged into your InduSoft account):\nhttp://download.indusoft.com/71.2.4/IWS71.2.4.zip\nInduSoft technical support can be contacted at:\nsupport@indusoft.com.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
