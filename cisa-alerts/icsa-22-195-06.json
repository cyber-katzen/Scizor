EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix Excel Importer Module\nVulnerability: XML Entity Expansion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise the availability of the affected component.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nMendix Excel Importer Module (Mendix 8 compatible): All versions prior to v9.2.2\nMendix Excel Importer Module (Mendix 9 compatible): All versions prior to v10.1.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RECURSIVE ENTITY REFERENCES IN DTDS (\u2018XML ENTITY EXPANSION\u2019) CWE-776\nThe affected component is vulnerable to XML entity expansion injection. An attacker may use this to compromise the availability of the affected component.\nCVE-2022-34467 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating to the latest version:\n\nMendix Excel Importer Module (Mendix 8 compatible): Update to v9.2.2 or later.\nMendix Excel Importer Module (Mendix 9 compatible): Update to v10.1.2 or later.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-610768\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
