EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Emerson\nEquipment: OpenEnterprise SCADA Software\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Improper Ownership Management, Inadequate Encryption Strength\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker access to OpenEnterprise configuration services or access passwords for OpenEnterprise user accounts.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nEmerson reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following OpenEnterprise SCADA Software:\n\nOpenEnterprise: all versions through 3.3.4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected components may allow an attacker to run an arbitrary commands with system privileges or perform remote code execution via a specific communication service.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-10640 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER OWNERSHIP MANAGEMENT CWE-282\nInadequate folder security permissions may allow modification of important configuration files, which could cause the system to fail or behave in an unpredictable manner.\nCVE-2020-10632 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nInadequate encryption may allow the passwords for OpenEnterprise user accounts to be obtained.\nCVE-2020-10636 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRoman Lozko of Kaspersky reported these vulnerabilities to Emerson.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEmerson recommends all users upgrade to OpenEnterprise 3.3, Service Pack 5 (3.3.5), to resolve these issues. OpenEnterprise Service Packs are available to users with access to the Emerson SupportNet system (login required). Details will be found in the downloads area.\nPlease send any questions via a SupportNet ticket or by contacting Emerson at US 800-537-9313. For users outside of the United States, please use international toll-free numbers.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
