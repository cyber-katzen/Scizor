MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  MiCODUS has reportedly fixed these vulnerabilities and recommends the following three\\-part mitigation:* For the [web tracking platform:](http://www.micodus.net/)  MiCODUS issued an update eliminating loopholes.* For the Android app: Users should update to V2\\.0\\.32 or later on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fw.gps.edkj&hl=en_US&gl=US)  .* For the iOS app: Users should update to V2\\.1\\.1or later on [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/micodus/id1472722711)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to Avoiding [Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
