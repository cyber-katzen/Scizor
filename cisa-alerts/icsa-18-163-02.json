[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SCALANCE X Switches (Update B)====================================== Last Revised December 15, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-163\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SCALANCE X switches* **Vulnerabilities:**  Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. UPDATE\u00a0INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-18\\-163\\-02 Siemens SCALANCE X Switches that was published January 14, 2020, on the ICS webpage cisa.gov/ics3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these cross\\-site scripting vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to store script code on the website and execute cross\\-site scripting (XSS), affecting the website\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, no known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports the vulnerabilities affects the following SCALANCE X switch products:* SCALANCE X\\-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v5\\.2\\.3 (only affected by CVE\\-2018\\-4848\\)* SCALANCE X\\-200 IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v5\\.4\\.1* SCALANCE X300 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v4\\.1\\.3**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SCALANCE X\\-200RNA switch family: All versions prior to v3\\.2\\.7**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### [4\\.2\\.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) A remote, authenticated attacker with access to the configuration web server could store script code on the website, provided the HRP redundancy option is set. This code could be executed in the web browser of users visiting this website (XSS), affecting its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. User interaction is required for successful exploitation as the user needs to visit the manipulated website.[CVE\\-2018\\-4842](CVE-2018-4842)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).#### [4\\.2\\.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) The integrated configuration web server of the affected Scalance X switches could allow XSS attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into accessing a malicious link. User interaction is required for successful exploitation. The user must be logged into the web interface in order for the exploitation to succeed.[CVE\\-2018\\-4848](CVE-2018-4848)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Marius Rothenb\u00fccher and Ali Abbasi reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens Product CERT.5\\.
