EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  WIN\\-911* **Equipment:**  WIN\\-911 2021* **Vulnerabilities:**  Incorrect Default Permissions2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to leverage the misconfigured privileges to the installed directory and achieve code execution in the application\u2019s context and permissions.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of WIN\\-911, an alarm notification platform, are affected:* WIN\\-911 2021 R1 \u2013 5\\.21\\.10* WIN\\-911 2021 R2 \u2013 5\\.21\\.17### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html) The affected product is vulnerable to a permissions misconfiguration that may allow an attacker to locally write files to the Program Announcer directory and elevate permissions whenever the program is executed.[CVE\\-2022\\-23922](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-23922)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html) The affected product is vulnerable to a permissions misconfiguration that may allow an attacker to locally write files to the program Operator Workspace directory, which holds DLL files and executables. A low\\-privilege attacker could write a malicious DLL file to the Operator Workspace directory to achieve privilege escalation and the permissions of the user running the program.[CVE\\-2022\\-23104](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-23104)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Noam Moshe of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- WIN\\-911 has released a hotfix that removes write access for the user\u2019s group on the affected directory subfolders. For the hotfix and more information, please use the following link: [WIN\\-911 2021 R1/R2 File Permission Vulnerability](https://supportdesk.win911.com/support/solutions/articles/24000074683-win-911-2021-r1-r2-file-permission-vulnerability)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
