Additionally, Rockwell Automation encourages customers to implement their suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability.\n \n\n\n* Restrict traffic to the SMTP port (25\\), if not needed.\n* Customers using the EN2/EN3 versions 10\\.x and higher can disable the email object, if not needed. Instructions can be found in the\n [EtherNet/IP Network Devices User Manual (rockwellautomation.com)](https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/enet-um006_-en-p.pdf)\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.
