EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendors: ICONICS, Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: ICONICS GENESIS64, Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Recursion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could trigger a stack overflow.\n\n\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric modules are affected in some third-party OPC Foundation products:\n\nGENESIS64: Versions 10.97 and prior\nHyper Historian: Versions 10.97 and prior\nAnalytiX: Versions 10.97 and prior\nMobileHMI: Versions 10.97 and prior\nMC Works64: Versions 4.04E and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RECURSION CWE-674\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an uncontrollable recursion, which may trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.\nCVE-2021-27432 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: ICONICS is headquartered in the United States. Mitsubishi Electric is headquartered in Japan.\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nEran Jacob with the Otorio Research Team reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric are releasing Critical Fix Rollup packages or patches that will include the solution to this vulnerability. GENESIS64 Versions 10.97.1 and later will not be vulnerable to this exploit.\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend users take the following mitigations:\n\nPlace control system networks and devices behind firewalls to isolate them from the business network.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet.\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nLeverage OPC UA security and certificates to ensure ICONICS products only connect to trusted OPC UA servers and clients.\nInstall the applicable Critical Fixes Rollup, if available.\n\nICONICS provides information and useful links related to its security updates at its company website.\nMitsubishi Electric provides information and useful links related to its security updates its company website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
