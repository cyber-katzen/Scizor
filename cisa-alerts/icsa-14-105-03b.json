Joel Langill of Infrastructure Defense Security Services reported to ICS-CERT and Siemens the OpenSSL vulnerability affecting the S7-1500.\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 3 --------\nSiemens has produced an update and Security Advisory (SSA-635659) that mitigates this vulnerability in each of the affected products listed below.\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 3 ----------\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 3 --------\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\neLAN-8.2 eLAN prior to 8.3.3 (affected when RIP is used\u2014update available),\nWinCC OA only V3.12 (always affected\u2014update available),\nS7-1500 V1.5 (affected when HTTPS active\u2014update available),\nCP1543-1 V1.1 (affected when FTPS active\u2014update available), and\nAPE 2.0 (affected when SSL/TLS component is used in customer implementation\u2014update available).\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 3 ----------\nIMPACT\nA successful \u201cHeartbleed\u201d exploit of the affected products by an attacker with network access could allow attackers to read sensitive data (to include private keys and user credentials) from the process memory.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected Siemens industrial products are for process and network control and monitoring in critical infrastructure sectors such as Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nBUFFER ERRORSCWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\n\nThe Heartbleed vulnerability could allow attackers to read unallocated memory of OpenSSL running processes. This could reveal secrets like transmitted data, passwords, or private keys.\nCVE-2014-0160NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed April 15, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nThe attacker must have network access to the affected devices to exploit this vulnerability. Siemens recommends operating all products except perimeter devices only within trusted networks.\n--------- Begin Update B Part 3 of 3 --------\nSiemens provides updates for the following products:\n\neLAN-8.2. To obtain the update to Version 8.3.3, submit a support request online at:\n\nhttp://www.siemens.com/automation/support-request\n\nWinCC OA V3.12. The update for WinCC OA 3.12 can be obtained here (login required):\n\nhttps://portal.etm.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=65&layout=blog&Itemid=80\n\nCP-1543-1 V1.1. The update for CP-1543 V1.1 can be obtained here:\n\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/92417421\n\nAPE 2.0. The update for APE can be obtained here:\n\nhttp://www.ruggedcom.com/support/appnotes/\n\nS7-1500 V1.5. The update for S7-1500 V1.5 can be obtained here:\n\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/67295862/133100\n\nS7-1500 V1.5. The update for S7-1500 Failsafe V1.5 can be obtained here:\n\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/87493352/133100\n--------- End Update B Part 3 of 3 ----------\nSiemens provides specific advice for mitigating risk in each of the affected products in SSA\u2011635659, which can be found at their web site at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nThe researcher suggests if HTTPS is not needed to disable it until a patch is available and applied to the vulnerable product/service.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
