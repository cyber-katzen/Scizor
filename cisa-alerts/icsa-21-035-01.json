EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Luxion* **Equipment:**  KeyShot products* **Vulnerabilities:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations, Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Path Traversal2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-21\\-035\\-01 Luxion KeyShot that was published February 4, 2021, on the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution, the storing of arbitrary scripts into automatic startup folders, and the attacking of products without sufficient UI warning.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Luxion software, 3D rendering and animation software, are affected:* KeyShot versions prior to 10\\.1* KeyShot Viewer versions prior to 10\\.1* KeyShot Network Rendering versions prior to 10\\.1* KeyVR versions prior to 10\\.1### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The affected product is vulnerable to multiple out\\-of\\-bounds write issues while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2021\\-22647](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22647)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) The affected product is vulnerable to an out\\-of\\-bounds read while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2021\\-22643](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22643)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
