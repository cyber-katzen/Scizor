Summary      Description     CISA obtained a variant of the WHIRLPOOL backdoor. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE\\-2023\\-2868, a former zero\\-day vulnerability affecting versions 5\\.1\\.3\\.001\\-9\\.2\\.0\\.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).       WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command\\-and\\-Control (C2\\) server.       For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors.

Description     The file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) device (Figure 1\\). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2\\). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.

Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
