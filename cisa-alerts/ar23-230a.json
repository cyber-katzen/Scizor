The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.\nScreenshots\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure 1. - The reverse shell component of 'ssld'.\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure 2. - The file 'ssld' looking for a string with a '.io' extension.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Service Desk (UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
