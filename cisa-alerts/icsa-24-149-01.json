EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 6.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Campbell Scientific\nEquipment: CSI Web Server\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Weak Encoding for Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to download files and decode stored passwords.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server and RTMC (Real-Time Monitoring and Control) Pro, which contains the CSI Web Server are affected:\n\nCampbell Scientific CSI Web Server: Versions 1.6 and prior\nRTMC Pro: Version 5.0 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nThe Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server supports a command that will return the most recent file that matches a given expression. A specially crafted expression can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. This command combined with a specially crafted expression allows anonymous, unauthenticated access (allowed by default) by an attacker to files and directories outside of the webserver root directory they should be restricted to.\nCVE-2024-5433 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-5433. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 WEAK ENCODING FOR PASSWORD CWE-261\nThe Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server stores web authentication credentials in a file with a specific file name. Passwords within that file are stored in a weakly encoded format. There is no known way to remotely access the file unless it has been manually renamed. However, if an attacker were to gain access to the file, passwords could be decoded and reused to gain access.\nCVE-2024-5434 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-5434. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater, and Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPatrick K. Sheehan, Grant Hume, and Donald Macary reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCampbell Scientific recommends users to update to the version.For user of CSI Web Server update to the most recent CSI Web Server 1.x patch\nFor users of RTMC Pro 5 update to the most recent RTMC Pro 5.x patch\nFor users of RTMC Pro 4 update to the most recent RTMC Pro 4.x patch.\nContact Campbell Scientific for more details.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
