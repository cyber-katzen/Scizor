Siemens has produced firmware updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX versions are affected when NTP service is activated:\n\nROX II: All versions prior to 2.9.0, and\nROX I: All versions.\n\nThe NTP service is deactivated on ROX I and ROX II-based devices by default.\nIMPACT\nAn attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could cause the NTP daemon to accept malicious time updates, prevent it from receiving updates, or crash.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected products, Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX-based devices, are used to connect devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets. According to Siemens, RUGGEDCOM ROX-based devices are deployed across several sectors including Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, and Transportation Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE-592: Authentication Bypass issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html, web site last accessed December 22, 2015.\n\nAn attacker could potentially make the NTP daemon accept time updates from nonspecified NTP servers by sending specially crafted UDP packets to the NTP service (Port 123/UDP).\nCVE-2015-7871NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7871, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

To obtain the firmware update, please contact Siemens support at:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/automation/support-request\nor a local hotline center:\nhttp://www.automation.siemens.com/mcms/aspa-db/en/automationtechnology/Pages/default.aspx\nFor ROX I-based devices and ROX II versions before ROX 2.9.0, Siemens recommends implementing the following mitigations:\n\nBlock NTP packets from unknown peers using firewall rules.\nEmploy NTP time synchronization in trusted network only.\nEnsure that the NTP configuration file contains the \u201cnoquery\u201d flag for all nonlocal restrict statements, or deactivate NTP service if the functionality is not required.\nConfigure NTP authentication and configure the \u201cnotrust\u201d flag for all nonlocal restrict statements on the NTP configuration (only applies to ROX II).\n\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-472334 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories/\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
