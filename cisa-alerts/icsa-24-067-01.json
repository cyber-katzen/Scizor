EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 2\\.3*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Chirp Systems* **Equipment**  : Chirp Access* **Vulnerability**  : Use of Hard\\-coded Password2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to adjust the Beacon configuration settings and/or disable the Bluetooth functionality of doors where non\\-networked Beacons are deployed.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Chirp Systems products are affected when deployed in non\\-networked beacon configurations:* Chirp Access app (Android and iOS): All Versions### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**USE OF HARD\\-CODED PASSWORD CWE\\-259**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html) The Chirp Access app contains a hard\\-coded password, BEACON\\_PASSWORD. An attacker within Bluetooth range could change configuration settings within the Bluetooth beacon, effectively disabling the application's ability to notify users when they are near a Beacon\\-enabled access point. This variable cannot be used to change the configuration settings of the door readers or locksets and does not affect the ability for authorized users of the mobile application to lock or unlock access points.[CVE\\-2024\\-2197](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-2197)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2024\\-2197](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-2197)  . A base score of 2\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS4\\.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities Sector* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  United States* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Matt Brown reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\.
