Carlo Gavazzi recommends upgrading to the following firmware versions:\n \n\n\n* VMU\\-C EM A11\\_U05 for VMUC EM, and\n* VMU\\-C PV A17 for VMUC PV.\n\n\n\n The relevant firmware versions are available either by means of the firmware update function embedded in the VMU\\-C or by downloading them from Carlo Gavazzi\u2019s web site. Please open the link:\n \n\n\n\n[http://www.gavazzi\\-automation.com/nsc/HQ/EN/energy\\_efficiency\\_monitoring](http://www.gavazzi-automation.com/nsc/HQ/EN/energy_efficiency_monitoring) \n ,\n \n\n\n\n Then:\n \n\n\n* Click on \u201cSelect the Product.\u201d\n* Choose \u201cWeb\\-Server\u201d from the \u201cFUNCTION\u201d column.\n* A list including both VMU\\-C EM and VMU\\-C PV will appear; select the target VMU\\-C model from the list.\n* From the \u201cdownloads\u201d section on the right, click on the \u201cSoftware\u201d icon to start downloading the updated firmware package.\n\n\n\n NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. Remotely exploitable. Low skill level is needed to exploit.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n----------------------\n\n\n\n[ACCESS CONTROL CWE 284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n The access control flaw allows access to most application functions without authentication.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-5144](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5144) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
