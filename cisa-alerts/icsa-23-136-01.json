EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Snap One\nEquipment:\u00a0OvrC Cloud, OvrC Pro Devices\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Improper Input Validation, Observable Response Discrepancy, Improper Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, Open Redirect, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Hidden Functionality\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate and claim devices, execute arbitrary code, and disclose information about the affected device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Snap One component is affected:\n\nOvrC Pro: All versions prior to 7.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe Hub in the Snap One OvrC cloud platform is a device used to centralize and manage nested devices connected to it. A vulnerability exists in which an attacker could impersonate a hub and send device requests to claim already claimed devices. The OvrC cloud platform receives the requests but does not validate if the found devices are already managed by another user.\nCVE-2023-28649 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE-204\nWhen supplied with a random MAC address, Snap One OvrC cloud servers will return information about the device. The MAC address of devices can be enumerated in an attack and the OvrC cloud will disclose their information.\nCVE-2023-28412 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSnap One OvrC cloud servers contain a route an attacker can use to bypass requirements and claim devices outright.\nCVE-2023-31241 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nSnap One OvrC Pro versions prior to 7.3 use HTTP connections when downloading a program from their servers. Because they do not use HTTPS, OvrC Pro devices are susceptible to exploitation.\nCVE-2023-31193 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345\nSnap One OvrC Pro devices versions 7.2 and prior do not validate firmware updates correctly. The device only calculates the MD5 hash of the firmware and does not check using a private-public key mechanism. The lack of complete PKI system firmware signature could allow attackers to upload arbitrary firmware updates, resulting in code execution.\nCVE-2023-28386 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601\nDevices using Snap One OvrC cloud are sent to a web address when accessing a web management interface using a HTTP connection. Attackers could impersonate a device and supply malicious information about the device\u2019s web server interface. By supplying malicious parameters, an attacker could redirect the user to arbitrary and dangerous locations on the web.\nCVE-2023-31245 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.7\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nSnap One OvrC Pro versions prior to 7.2 have their own locally running web server accessible both from the local network and remotely. OvrC cloud contains a hidden superuser account accessible through hard-coded credentials.\nCVE-2023-31240 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\u00a0\n3.2.8\u00a0HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITY CWE-912\nIn Snap One OvrC Pro versions prior to 7.2, when logged into the superuser account, a new functionality appears that could allow users to execute arbitrary commands on the hub device.\nCVE-2023-25183 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nUri Katz of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSnap One has released the following updates/fixes for the affected products:\n\nOvrC Pro v7.2 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.\nOvrC Pro v7.3 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.\nDisable UPnP.\n\nFor more information, see Snap One\u2019s Release Notes.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\u00a0\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
