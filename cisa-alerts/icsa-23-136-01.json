EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Snap One* **Equipment:**  OvrC Cloud, OvrC Pro Devices* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Input Validation, Observable Response Discrepancy, Improper Access Control, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, Open Redirect, Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials, Hidden Functionality2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate and claim devices, execute arbitrary code, and disclose information about the affected device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Snap One component is affected:* OvrC Pro: All versions prior to 7\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** The Hub in the Snap One OvrC cloud platform is a device used to centralize and manage nested devices connected to it. A vulnerability exists in which an attacker could impersonate a hub and send device requests to claim already claimed devices. The OvrC cloud platform receives the requests but does not validate if the found devices are already managed by another user.[CVE\\-2023\\-28649](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28649)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE\\-204](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204)** When supplied with a random MAC address, Snap One OvrC cloud servers will return information about the device. The MAC address of devices can be enumerated in an attack and the OvrC cloud will disclose their information.[CVE\\-2023\\-28412](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28412)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** Snap One OvrC cloud servers contain a route an attacker can use to bypass requirements and claim devices outright.[CVE\\-2023\\-31241](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31241)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** Snap One OvrC Pro versions prior to 7\\.3 use HTTP connections when downloading a program from their servers. Because they do not use HTTPS, OvrC Pro devices are susceptible to exploitation.[CVE\\-2023\\-31193](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31193)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE\\-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)** Snap One OvrC Pro devices versions 7\\.2 and prior do not validate firmware updates correctly. The device only calculates the MD5 hash of the firmware and does not check using a private\\-public key mechanism. The lack of complete PKI system firmware signature could allow attackers to upload arbitrary firmware updates, resulting in code execution.[CVE\\-2023\\-28386](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28386)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 [URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE\\-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)** Devices using Snap One OvrC cloud are sent to a web address when accessing a web management interface using a HTTP connection. Attackers could impersonate a device and supply malicious information about the device\u2019s web server interface. By supplying malicious parameters, an attacker could redirect the user to arbitrary and dangerous locations on the web.[CVE\\-2023\\-31245](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-31245)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Communications* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Uri Katz of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Snap One has released the following updates/fixes for the affected products:* OvrC Pro v7\\.2 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.* OvrC Pro v7\\.3 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.* Disable UPnP. For more information, see Snap One\u2019s [Release Notes](https://www.control4.com/docs/product/ovrc-software/release-notes/english/latest/ovrc-software-release-notes-rev-p.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
