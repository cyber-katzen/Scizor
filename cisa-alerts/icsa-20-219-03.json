EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit/public exploits are available\nVendor: Geutebr\u00fcck\nEquipment: G-Cam and G-Code\nVulnerability: OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote code execution as root.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nGeutebruck reports the vulnerability affects firmware Versions 1.12.0.25 and prior as well as the limited Versions 1.12.13.2 and 1.12.14.5 of the following Encoder and E2 Series Camera models:\n\nG-Code:\u00a0\n\nEEC-2xxx\n\n\nG-Cam:\u00a0\n\nEBC-21xx\nEFD-22xx\nETHC-22xx\nEWPC-22xx\n\n\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nUsing a specially crafted URL command, a remote authenticated user can execute commands as root.\nCVE-2020-16205 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Financial Services, Government Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDavy Douhine of RandoriSec reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGeutebr\u00fcck recommends users update to firmware Version 1.12.0.27\nThe link for the download area on the Geutebr\u00fcck website \u201clatest firmware\u201d is the same as for the advisory \u201csecurity advisory\u201d (Login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
