EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Siveillance Video 2022 R2\nVulnerability: Weak Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens Siveillance Video, a mobile server, are affected:\n\nAll versions prior to V22.2a(80)\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WEAK AUTHENTICATION CWE-1390\nSiemens Siveillance Video Mobile Server versions prior to V22.2a(80) contain an authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\nCVE-2022-43400 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications, Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMilestone\u2019s PSIRT reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released a hotfix for Siveillance Video 2022 R2 and recommends applying the hotfix on all installations of the mobile server.\n\nUpdate to V22.2a(80) or a later version by applying the latest hotfix of the Mobile Server Installer (Vulnerability Hotfix).\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nEnable the feature \u201cServers > Mobile Servers > Deny the built-in Administrators role access to the mobile servers\u201d for all configured mobile servers.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information, see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-640732 in HTML or CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
