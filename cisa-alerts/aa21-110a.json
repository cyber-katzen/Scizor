Since March 31, 2021, CISA and Ivanti have assisted multiple entities whose vulnerable Pulse Connect Secure products have been exploited by a cyber threat actor. These entities confirmed the malicious activity after running the\n [Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755) \n . To gain initial access, the threat actor is leveraging multiple vulnerabilities, including\n [CVE\\-2019\\-11510](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510) \n ,\n [CVE\\-2020\\-8260](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8260) \n ,\n [CVE\\-2020\\-8243](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8243) \n , and the newly disclosed\n [CVE\\-2021\\-22893](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44784/) \n .

These devices, which the threat actor is using to proxy the connection, correlate with the country of the victim and allow the actor activity to blend in with normal telework user activity.\u00a0Note: these devices are not related to the Pulse vulnerabilities, but rather, where the malicious internet traffic passes through.\n \n\n\n\n Details about lateral movement and post\\-exploitation are still unknown at this time. CISA will update this alert as this information becomes available.\n \n\n\n### (Updated April 30, 2021\\): Detections\n\n\n#### *(Updated April 30, 2021\\): Impossible Travel*\n\n\n\n During the course of analysis, it is possible that a network defender may be able to reveal illegitimate connections from users that are masquerading as legitimate users from different geolocations. CISA has noted IPs associated with malicious webshell interaction from a threat actor\u2014associated with a single username\u2014in both the authenticated and the unauthenticated logs at the same time. The geo\\-location for the two IP addresses was sufficiently far that impossible travel calculations could detect the threat actor IP address.\n \n\n\n#### *(Updated April 30, 2021\\): TLS Fingerprinting*\n\n\n\n Transport Layer Security (TLS) fingerprinting may also be useful in identifying malicious activity. CISA has noted re\\-use of various JA3 hashes including JA3 hashes that align with Chrome, Firefox, and others. Caution should be taken when using TLS fingerprinting because the majority of the JA3 hashes observed in connection with Pulse Connect Secure exploitation were not unique to malicious activity. The same JA3 hashes\u2014and the software they characterize\u2014are often used for benign activity, vulnerability scanning, etc. Overlap in JA3 hashes cannot be considered a high\\-fidelity indicator of malicious activity, let alone successful exploitation. Connections made via JA3 must be corroborated with other data points.\n \n\n\n* A common observation is that the TLS connections frequently exclude the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension, which is relatively rare in most environments where users connect to Domain Name Server (DNS) host names (but is commonly observed in scanning). It is believed this is an artifact of attackers browsing direct to IP addresses instead of host names.\n* The JA3 hashes in table 2 below have been observed in connection with a pulse secure exploitation.\n **Note:** \n there may be many User\\-Agents associated with a given JA3 (often due to User\\-Agent spoofing) and the prevalence of a given JA3 necessarily differs by environment. The prevalence column of table 2 refers to how often the specific JA3 hash was observed in the dataset that was being analyzed. Some hashes are rarely observed in the dataset and the information is provided for context only. Analytical conclusions should not be made solely based on this reporting.

The Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) helps system owners understand if their Pulse Secure Connect device has been compromised. While the tool is accurate, there are several nuances\u00a0to its effective use.\n\t+ The ICT detects evidence of adversary cleanup only on the current, running version of PCS.\n\t+ It may be necessary to roll back the current PCS version to have a valid run of the ICT.\n\t+ During the upgrade process, the active version becomes a rollback partition.\n\t+ Only one rollback partition exists on a device, as the rollback partition is replaced on each update.\n\t+ Therefore, if an entity has updated their PCS device without running the correct version of the ICT (as outlined in Appendix B), anomalous activity will not be detected.\n\n\n\n If the Integrity Checker Tools finds mismatched or unauthorized files, CISA urges organizations to:\n \n\n\n* Contact CISA to report your findings (see Contact Information section below).\n* Contact\n [Ivanti Pulse Secure](https://support.pulsesecure.net/support/support-contacts/) \n for assistance in capturing forensic information.\n* Review \u201cUnauthenticated Web Requests\u201d log for evidence of exploitation, if enabled.\n* Change all passwords associated with accounts passing through the Pulse Secure environment (including user accounts, service accounts, administrative accounts and any accounts that could be modified by any account described above, all of these accounts should be assumed to be compromised).\n **Note:** \n Unless an exhaustive password reset occurs, factory resetting a Pulse Connect Secure appliance (see Step 3 below) will only remove malicious code from the device, and may not remove the threat actor from the environment. The threat actor may use the credentials harvested to regain access even after the appliance is fully patched.\n* Review logs for any unauthorized authentications originating from the Pulse Connect Secure appliance IP address or the DHCP lease range of the Pulse Connect Secure appliance's VPN lease pool.\n* ***(Updated May 27, 2021\\)***\n**Note:** \n adversary activity may not be easily identifiable on your network as it may appear as a normal user traffic.\u00a0If a device has been compromised, entities should take all precautions as if the adversary has intruded past the device into your network and take steps to ensure there are no further signs of an intrusion into networks that include:\n\t+ Look for unauthorized applications and scheduled tasks in environments.\n\t+ Ensure no new administrators were created.\n\t+ Ensure non\\-privileged users were not added to privileged groups.\n\t+ Scrutinize and monitor all accounts with domain administrator privileges.\n\t+ Monitor domain administrator accounts to ensure they\u00a0are only accessing the part of the network they are authorized to access.\n\t+ Check all accounts should be checked to ensure they have the proper level of privileges and have not been altered such as increased privileges.\n\t+ Remove any remote access programs not approved by the organization.\n\t+ Carefully inspect scheduled tasks for scripts or executables that may allow a threat actor to connect to an environment.\n\n\n\n In addition to the recommendations above, organizations that find evidence of malicious, suspicious, or anomalous activity or files, should consider the guidance in\n [KB44764 \\- Customer FAQ: PCS Security Integrity Tool Enhancements](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44764) \n , which includes:\n \n\n\n\n After preservation, you can remediate your Pulse Connect Secure appliance by:\n \n\n\n1. Disabling the external\\-facing interface.\n2. Saving the system and user config.\n3. Performing a factory reset via the Serial Console.\n **Note:** \n For more information refer to\n [KB22964](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB22964/?kA1j0000000FjFj) \n (How to reset a PCS device to the factory default setting via the serial console)\n4. Updating the appliance to the newest version.\n5. Re\\-importing the saved config.\n6. Re\\-enabling the external interface.\n\n\n\n CISA recommends performing checks to ensure any infection is remediated, even if the workstation or host has been reimaged. These checks should include running the\n [Pulse Secure Connect Integrity\u00a0Tool](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755) \n again after remediation has been taken place.\n \n\n\n\n CISA would like to thank Ivanti for their contributions to this Alert.\n \n\n\n\n### Contact Information\n\n\n\n\n CISA encourages recipients of this report to contribute any additional information that they may have related to this threat.
