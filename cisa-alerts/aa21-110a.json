Since March 31, 2021, CISA and Ivanti have assisted multiple entities whose vulnerable Pulse Connect Secure products have been exploited by a cyber threat actor. These entities confirmed the malicious activity after running the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool. To gain initial access, the threat actor is leveraging multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2020-8260, CVE-2020-8243, and the newly disclosed CVE-2021-22893. The threat actor is using this access to place webshells on the Pulse Connect Secure appliance for further access and persistence. The known webshells allow for a variety of functions, including authentication bypass, multi-factor authentication bypass, password logging, and persistence through patching.\n(Updated May 3, 2021): Ivanti \u00a0has released \u00a0Security Advisory SA44784\u00a0addressing CVE-2021-22893 and three additional newly disclosed CVEs\u2014CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900. CISA strongly encourages organizations using Ivanti Pulse Connect Secure appliances to immediately run the Pulse Secure Connect\u00a0Integrity\u00a0Tool, update to the latest software version, and investigate for malicious activity.\n(Updated May 27. 2021): CISA has updated this alert to include new threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updated mitigations. See Ivanti KB44755 - Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) Integrity Assurance for updated guidance to\u00a0ensure the full integrity of your Pulse Connect Secure software.\n(Updated July 21, 2021): Please see CISA's new Malware Analysis Reports in regards to adversary activity analyzed by CISA that were discovered on Pulse Connect Secure\u00a0Devices.\n\nMAR-10333209-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10333243-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10334057-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10334057-2.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10334587-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10334587-2.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10335467-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10336161-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10336935-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10337580-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10337580-2.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10338401-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10338868-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\n\n(Updated August 11, 2021): Ivanti has released Pulse Connect Secure system software version 9.1R12 to address multiple vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to take control of an affected system. CISA encourages organizations to review Security Advisory SA44858 and apply the necessary update.\n(Updated August 24, 2021):\u00a0Please see CISA's new Malware Analysis Reports for analysis of malicious activity discovered on Pulse Secure Connect devices.\n\nMAR-10336935-2.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMAR-10333243-3.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10338401-2.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10334057-3.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\nMAR-10339606-1.v1: Pulse Connect Secure\n\nFor a downloadable list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see AA21-110A.stix.\n\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nOn March 31, 2021, Ivanti released the\u00a0Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool to detect the integrity of Pulse Connect Secure appliances. Their technical bulletin states:\nWe are aware of reports that a limited number of customers have identified unusual activity on their Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) appliances. The investigation to date shows ongoing attempts to exploit vulnerabilities outlined in two security advisories that were patched in 2019 and 2020 to address previously known issues: Security Advisory SA44101 (CVE-2019-11510) and Security Advisory SA44601 (CVE- 2020- 8260). For more information visit KB44764 (Customer FAQ).\n(Updated May 27, 2021): CISA has observed the cyber threat actor performing cleanup as demonstrated by the following:\n\nThreat actor was observed timestomping trojanized umount binary to match timestamps of legitimate binaries attempting to disguise the modifications; the touch command was used to modify the time stamp https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 /bin/touch /tmp/data/root/bin/umount -r /tmp/data/root/bin/cp\n\u00a0 \u00a0 2.

See the FireEye blog post, Re-Checking Your Pulse, for more information, including activity related to actor cleanup.\nThe suspected cyber threat actor modified several legitimate Pulse Secure files on the impacted Pulse Connect Secure appliances. The modifications implemented a variety of webshell functionality:\n\nDSUpgrade.pm MD5: 4d5b410e1756072a701dfd3722951907\n\nRuns arbitrary commands passed to it\nCopies malicious code into Licenseserverproto.cgi\n\n\nLicenseserverproto.cgi MD5: 9b526db005ee8075912ca6572d69a5d6\n\nCopies malicious logic to the new files during the patching process, allowing for persistence\n\n\nSecid_canceltoken.cgi MD5: f2beca612db26d771fe6ed7a87f48a5a\n\nRuns arbitrary commands passed via HTTP requests\n\n\ncompcheckresult.cgi MD5: ca0175d86049fa7c796ea06b413857a3\n\nPublicly-facing page to send arbitrary commands with ID argument\n\n\nLogin.cgi MD5: 56e2a1566c7989612320f4ef1669e7d5\n\nAllows for credential harvesting of authenticated users\n\n\nHealthcheck.cgi MD5: 8c291ad2d50f3845788bc11b2f603b4a\n\nRuns arbitrary commands passed via HTTP requests\n\n\n\nMany of the threat actor\u2019s early actions are logged in the Unauthenticated Requests Log as seen in the following format, URIs have been redacted to minimize access to webshells that may still be active:\nUnauthenticated request url /dana-na/[redacted URI]?id=cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted URI] came from IP XX.XX.XX.XX.\nThe threat actor then ran the commands listed in table 1 via the webshell.\nTable 1: Commands run via webshell\n\n\n\nTime \nCommand \n\n\n\n\n2021-01-19T07:46:05.000+0000\npwd\n\n\n2021-01-19T07:46:24.000+0000\ncat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]\n\n\n2021-01-19T08:10:13.000+0000\ncat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/l[redacted]\n\n\n2021-01-19T08:14:18.000+0000\nSee Appendix.\n\n\n2021-01-19T08:15:11.000+0000\ncat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]\n\n\n2021-01-19T08:15:49.000+0000\ncat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]\n\n\n2021-01-19T09:03:05.000+0000\ncat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]\n\n\n2021-01-19T09:04:47.000+0000\n$mount\n\n\n2021-01-19T09:05:13.000+0000\n/bin/mount%20-o%20remount,rw%20/dev/root%20/\n\n\n2021-01-19T09:07:10.000+0000\n$mount\n\n\n\nThe cyber threat actor is using exploited devices located on residential IP space\u2014including publicly facing Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices and small home business routers from multiple vendors\u2014to proxy their connection to interact with the webshells they placed on these devices. These devices, which the threat actor is using to proxy the connection, correlate with the country of the victim and allow the actor activity to blend in with normal telework user activity.\u00a0Note: these devices are not related to the Pulse vulnerabilities, but rather, where the malicious internet traffic passes through.\nDetails about lateral movement and post-exploitation are still unknown at this time. CISA will update this alert as this information becomes available.\n(Updated April 30, 2021): Detections\n(Updated April 30, 2021): Impossible Travel\nDuring the course of analysis, it is possible that a network defender may be able to reveal illegitimate connections from users that are masquerading as legitimate users from different geolocations. CISA has noted IPs associated with malicious webshell interaction from a threat actor\u2014associated with a single username\u2014in both the authenticated and the unauthenticated logs at the same time. The geo-location for the two IP addresses was sufficiently far that impossible travel calculations could detect the threat actor IP address.\n(Updated April 30, 2021): TLS Fingerprinting\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) fingerprinting may also be useful in identifying malicious activity. CISA has noted re-use of various JA3 hashes including JA3 hashes that align with Chrome, Firefox, and others. Caution should be taken when using TLS fingerprinting because the majority of the JA3 hashes observed in connection with Pulse Connect Secure exploitation were not unique to malicious activity. The same JA3 hashes\u2014and the software they characterize\u2014are often used for benign activity, vulnerability scanning, etc. Overlap in JA3 hashes cannot be considered a high-fidelity indicator of malicious activity, let alone successful exploitation. Connections made via JA3 must be corroborated with other data points.\n\nA common observation is that the TLS connections frequently exclude the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension, which is relatively rare in most environments where users connect to Domain Name Server (DNS) host names (but is commonly observed in scanning). It is believed this is an artifact of attackers browsing direct to IP addresses instead of host names.\nThe JA3 hashes in table 2 below have been observed in connection with a pulse secure exploitation. Note: there may be many User-Agents associated with a given JA3 (often due to User-Agent spoofing) and the prevalence of a given JA3 necessarily differs by environment. The prevalence column of table 2 refers to how often the specific JA3 hash was observed in the dataset that was being analyzed. Some hashes are rarely observed in the dataset and the information is provided for context only. Analytical conclusions should not be made solely based on this reporting. The prevalence of a JA3 hash observed in an environment would need to be further evaluated.\n\n\u00a0\nTable 2: JA3 MD5 hashes and associated prevalence/user-agent\n\n\n\nJA3 Hash\nUser-Agent\nPrevalence\n\n\n\n\n\n227ab2ae6ed6abcc249e8a873a033144\n\nFirefox (~68-71)\nvery rare\n\n\n\n30017f6f809155387cbcf95be6e7225d\n\n(UA header frequently not set)\nrare\n\n\n\n3cbc88eabdac9af71445f9040a6cf46c\n\nChrome (~50-57)\nvery rare\n\n\n\n53829d58e2631a372bb4de1be2cbecca\n\nChrome (~51-81)\nrare\n\n\n\n714cdf6e462870e2b85d251a3b22064b\n\nFirefox (~65-68)\nvery rare\n\n\n\n86cb13d6bbb3ac96b78b408bcfc18794\n\nPython-requests, many others\ncommon (but rare when used with pulse secure)\n\n\n\n8f6747b71d1003df1b7e3e8232b1a7e3\n\nChrome (~89)\nrare\n\n\n\n916e458922ae9a1bab6b1154689c7de7\n\nFirefox (~60-86)\nvery rare\n\n\n\na29d0d294a6236b5bf0ec2573dd4f02f\n\nFirefox (~77-87), Chrome (~78-90), others\nvery rare\n\n\n\naf26ba5e85475b634275141e6ed3dc54\n\nPython-requests, many others\nrare\n\n\n\nb592adaa596bb72a5c1ccdbecae52e3f\n\nChrome (~79-90)\nrare\n\n\n\nc12f54a3f91dc7bafd92cb59fe009a35\n\nOffice, many others\nvery rare\n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\n(Updated May 3, 2021)\u00a0CISA strongly urges organizations using Pulse Secure devices to immediately:\n\nReview the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool Quick Start Guide and Customer FAQs\nRun the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity\u00a0Tool.\n\nThe tool requires a reboot.\nIf virtualized, take a snapshot before running.\nIf the appliance is physical, consider the consequences of rebooting and running the tool and contact Ivanti for assistance or questions.\n(Updated May 3, 2021)\u00a0Continue to run the tool daily until the XML mitigations have been implemented or the patch has been deployed.\u00a0Note: the Pulse Secure team released Security Advisory SA44784\u00a0that addresses CVE-2021-22893, CVE-2021-22984, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900 with patches.\n\n\nImplement the mitigations released by the vendor. According Ivanti Pulse Secure, the interim XML configurations listed in the \"Workaround\" section of SA44784 - 2021-04: Out-of-Cycle Advisory: Pulse Connect Secure RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) provide significant protection against threat actor activity.\n(Updated May 3, 2021)\u00a0Update to the latest software version., per the process outlined on Ivanti Pulse Secure\u2019s website which contains security enhancements.\n(Updated May 27, 2021) Using the Pulse Secure Integrity Checker. The Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) helps system owners understand if their Pulse Secure Connect device has been compromised. While the tool is accurate, there are several nuances\u00a0to its effective use.\n\nThe ICT detects evidence of adversary cleanup only on the current, running version of PCS.\nIt may be necessary to roll back the current PCS version to have a valid run of the ICT.\nDuring the upgrade process, the active version becomes a rollback partition.\nOnly one rollback partition exists on a device, as the rollback partition is replaced on each update.\nTherefore, if an entity has updated their PCS device without running the correct version of the ICT (as outlined in Appendix B), anomalous activity will not be detected.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf the Integrity Checker Tools finds mismatched or unauthorized files, CISA urges organizations to:\n\nContact CISA to report your findings (see Contact Information section below).\nContact Ivanti Pulse Secure for assistance in capturing forensic information.\nReview \u201cUnauthenticated Web Requests\u201d log for evidence of exploitation, if enabled.\nChange all passwords associated with accounts passing through the Pulse Secure environment (including user accounts, service accounts, administrative accounts and any accounts that could be modified by any account described above, all of these accounts should be assumed to be compromised). Note: Unless an exhaustive password reset occurs, factory resetting a Pulse Connect Secure appliance (see Step 3 below) will only remove malicious code from the device, and may not remove the threat actor from the environment. The threat actor may use the credentials harvested to regain access even after the appliance is fully patched.\nReview logs for any unauthorized authentications originating from the Pulse Connect Secure appliance IP address or the DHCP lease range of the Pulse Connect Secure appliance's VPN lease pool.\n(Updated May 27, 2021)\u00a0Note: adversary activity may not be easily identifiable on your network as it may appear as a normal user traffic.\u00a0If a device has been compromised, entities should take all precautions as if the adversary has intruded past the device into your network and take steps to ensure there are no further signs of an intrusion into networks that include:\n\nLook for unauthorized applications and scheduled tasks in environments.\u00a0\nEnsure no new administrators were created.\nEnsure non-privileged users were not added to privileged groups.\nScrutinize and monitor all accounts with domain administrator privileges.\u00a0\nMonitor domain administrator accounts to ensure they\u00a0are only accessing the part of the network they are authorized to access.\u00a0\nCheck all accounts should be checked to ensure they have the proper level of privileges and have not been altered such as increased privileges.\u00a0\nRemove any remote access programs not approved by the organization.\nCarefully inspect scheduled tasks for scripts or executables that may allow a threat actor to connect to an environment.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the recommendations above, organizations that find evidence of malicious, suspicious, or anomalous activity or files, should consider the guidance in KB44764 - Customer FAQ: PCS Security Integrity Tool Enhancements, which includes:\nAfter preservation, you can remediate your Pulse Connect Secure appliance by:\u00a0\n\nDisabling the external-facing interface. \u00a0\nSaving the system and user config.\nPerforming a factory reset via the Serial Console. Note: For more information refer to KB22964 (How to reset a PCS device to the factory default setting via the serial console)\nUpdating the appliance to the newest version.\nRe-importing the saved config.\u00a0 \u00a0\nRe-enabling the external interface.\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends performing checks to ensure any infection is remediated, even if the workstation or host has been reimaged. These checks should include running the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity\u00a0Tool again after remediation has been taken place.\nCISA would like to thank Ivanti for their contributions to this Alert.\n\nContact Information\n\nCISA encourages recipients of this report to contribute any additional information that they may have related to this threat.
