A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0SQL INJECTION CWE-89\nThe ArchiveService.rem service exposes functions lacking proper authentication. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements.\nCVE-2021-27464 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nFactoryTalk AssetCentre components contain .NET remoting endpoints that deserialize untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain full access to the FactoryTalk AssetCentre main server and all agent machines.\nCVE-2021-27460 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSharon Brizinov and Amir Preminger of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Rockwell Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation encourages users of the affected versions of FactoryTalk AssetCentre to update to AssetCentre v11 (or above) to addresses these vulnerabilities. \u00a0For more information about these vulnerabilities and mitigations please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s publication KnowledgeBase ID: PN1559\nAs an additional mitigation, Rockwell Automation encourages users who are unable to upgrade or are concerned about unauthorized client connections to use built in security features found within FactoryTalk AssetCentre. Users should follow guidance found in QA46277. IPsec would minimize exposure to unauthorized clients and has been tested in FactoryTalk AssetCentre v9-v11\nRockwell Automation recommends the following software/PC-based mitigation strategies:\n\nRun all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.\nUse of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at Knowledge Base Article QA17329\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\n\nRockwell Automation recommends the following general mitigations:\n\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article PN715\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.\u00a0CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
