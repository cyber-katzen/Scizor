EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Mitsubishi Electric\nEquipment: MELSEC-Q series PLCs\nVulnerability: Resource Exhaustion\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to send specially crafted packets to the device, causing Ethernet communication to stop.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following MELSEC-Q series PLCs are affected:\n\nQ03/04/06/13/26UDVCPU: serial number 20081 and prior,\nQ04/06/13/26UDPVCPU: serial number 20081 and prior, and\nQ03UDECPU, Q04/06/10/13/20/26/50/100UDEHCPU: serial number 20101 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION ('RESOURCE EXHAUSTION') CWE-400\nA remote attacker can send specific packets over several ports on the affected products that will result in an Ethernet communication crash.\nCVE-2019-6535 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTri Quach of Amazon\u2019s Customer Fulfillment Technology Security (CFTS) group reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric has produced a new version of the firmware. Additional information about this vulnerability or Mitsubishi electric\u2019s compensating control is available by contacting a local Mitsubishi Electric representative, which can be found at the following location:\nhttps://us.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/en/about-us/distributors\nMitsubishi Electric strongly recommends that users should operate the affected device behind a firewall.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
