EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor:\u00a0Rockwell Automation\nEquipment:\u00a0FactoryTalk Diagnostics\nVulnerability:\u00a0Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. UPDATE OR REPOSTED INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-051-02-Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Diagnostics that was published February 20, 2020 on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ICS.\u00a0\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\nThe following versions of FactoryTalk Diagnostic software, a subsystem of the FactoryTalk Service Platform, are affected:\u00a0\n\nFactoryTalk Diagnostics software: Versions 2.00 to 6.11\u00a0\n\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nAll versions of FactoryTalk Diagnostics software, a subsystem of the FactoryTalk Services Platform, are affected.\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nFactory Talk Diagnostics exposes a .NET Remoting endpoint via RNADiagnosticsSrv.exe at TCPtcp/8082, which can insecurely deserialize untrusted data.\nCVE-2020-6967\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nTrend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, working with rgod of 9sg, reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\nRockwell Automation will fully resolve this vulnerability in the next release of the FactoryTalk Service Platform.\u00a0\nRockwell Automation recommends affected users implement the following compensating controls, based on their needs:\u00a0\n\nUpgrade to version 6.20 or later for versions that predate version 6.20; this version restricts connection settings to only the local port.\u00a0\nInstall the\u00a0patch BF24822\u00a0to restrict connections settings to only the local port for versions 2.74, 2.80, 2.81, 2.90, 3.00, 6.10, or 6.11.\u00a0\nUpgrade to a more recent version for versions that predate version 2.74.\u00a0\nDisable the Remote Diagnostics Service if this service is not in use. Disabling this service does not result in data loss.\u00a0\nUse Windows Firewall Configuration to help prevent remote connection to the affected port if the Remote Diagnostics Service is in use.\u00a0\n\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor more information, please see\u00a0Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory\u00a0(login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\u00a0ICS webpage on us-cert.gov\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
