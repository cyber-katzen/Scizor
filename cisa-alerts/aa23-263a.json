Enable and enforce phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n***Note:** \n This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated with the Snatch ransomware variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 1, 2023\\.\n \n\n\n\n Since mid\\-2021, Snatch threat actors have consistently evolved their tactics to take advantage of current trends in the cybercriminal space and leveraged successes of other ransomware variants\u2019 operations. Snatch threat actors have targeted a wide range of critical infrastructure sectors including the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), Food and Agriculture, and Information Technology sectors. Snatch threat actors conduct ransomware operations involving data exfiltration and double extortion. After data exfiltration often involving direct communications with victims demanding ransom, Snatch threat actors may threaten victims with double extortion, where the victims\u2019 data will be posted on Snatch\u2019s extortion blog if the ransom goes unpaid.\n \n\n\n\n FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-263A.pdf](/sites/default/files/2023-09/joint-cybersecurity-advisory-stopransomware-snatch-ransomware_0.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 578\\.71 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-263A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2023-09/AA23-263A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 79\\.84 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-263A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2023-09/AA23-263A%20%23StopRansomware%20Snatch%20Ransomware.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 56\\.10 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 13\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Mapping\") \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n First appearing in 2018, Snatch operates a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) model and claimed their first U.S.\\-based victim in 2019\\. Originally, the group was referred to as Team Truniger, based on the nickname of a key group member, Truniger, who previously operated as a GandCrab affiliate. Snatch threat actors use a customized ransomware variant notable for rebooting devices into Safe Mode \\[\n [T1562\\.009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1562/009/ \"Impair Defenses: Safe Mode Boot\") \n ], enabling the ransomware to circumvent detection by antivirus or endpoint protection, and then encrypting files when few services are running.\n \n\n\n\n Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data released on Snatch\u2019s extortion blog.\n **Note:** \n Since November 2021, an extortion site operating under the name Snatch served as a clearinghouse for data exfiltrated or stolen from victim companies on Clearnet and TOR hosted by a bulletproof hosting service. In August 2023, individuals claiming to be associated with the blog gave a media interview claiming the blog was not associated with Snatch ransomware and \u201cnone of our targets has been attacked by Ransomware Snatch\u2026\u201d, despite multiple confirmed Snatch victims\u2019 data appearing on the blog alongside victims associated with other ransomware groups, notably Nokoyawa and Conti.\\[\n [1](https://www.databreaches.net/at-some-point-snatch-team-stopped-being-the-snatch-ransomware-gang-were-journalists-the-last-to-know/ \"At some point, SNAtch Team stopped being the Snatch ransomware gang. Were journalists the last to know?\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Initial Access and Persistence**\n\n\n\n Snatch threat actors employ several different methods to gain access to and maintain persistence on a victim\u2019s network. Snatch affiliates primarily rely on exploiting weaknesses in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ] for brute\\-forcing and gaining administrator credentials to victims\u2019 networks \\[\n [T1110\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1110/001/ \"Brute Force: Password Guessing\") \n ]. In some instances, Snatch affiliates have sought out compromised credentials from criminal forums/marketplaces \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Snatch threat actors gain persistence on a victim\u2019s network by compromising an administrator account \\[\n [T1078\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/002/ \"Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts\") \n ] and establishing connections over port\n `443` \n \\[\n [T1071\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1071/001/ \"Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\") \n ] to a command and control (C2\\) server located on a Russian bulletproof hosting service \\[\n [T1583\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1583/003/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server\") \n ]. Per IP traffic from event logs provided by recent victims, Snatch threat actors initiated RDP connections from a Russian bulletproof hosting service and through other virtual private network (VPN) services \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Data Discovery and Lateral Movement**\n\n\n\n Snatch threat actors were observed using different TTPs to discover data, move laterally, and search for data to exfiltrate. Snatch threat actors use\n `sc.exe` \n to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add system services using the Windows Command line. In addition to\n `sc.exe` \n , Snatch threat actors also use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike \\[\n [S0154](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n Prior to deploying the ransomware, Snatch threat actors were observed spending up to three months on a victim\u2019s system. Within this timeframe, Snatch threat actors exploited the victim\u2019s network \\[\n [T1590](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1590/ \"Gather Victim Network Information\") \n ], moving laterally across the victim\u2019s network with RDP \\[\n [T1021\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1021/001/ \"Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\") \n ] for the largest possible deployment of ransomware and searching for files and folders \\[\n [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1005/ \"Data from Local System\") \n ] for data exfiltration \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ] followed by file encryption \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Defense Evasion and Execution**\n\n\n\n During the early stages of ransomware deployment, Snatch threat actors attempt to disable antivirus software \\[\n [T1562\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1562/001/ \"Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\") \n ] and run an executable as a file named\n `safe.exe` \n or some variation thereof. In recent victims, the ransomware executable\u2019s name consisted of a string of hexadecimal characters which match the\n `SHA-256` \n hash of the file in an effort to defeat rule\\-based detection \\[\n [T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1036/ \"Masquerading\") \n ]. Upon initiation, the Snatch ransomware payload queries and modifies registry keys \\[\n [T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1012/ \"Query Registry\") \n ]\\[\n [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1112/ \"Modify Registry\") \n ], uses various native Windows tools to enumerate the system \\[\n [T1569\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1569/002/ \"System Services: Service Execution\") \n ], finds processes \\[\n [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1057/ \"Process Discovery\") \n ], and creates benign processes to execute Windows batch (\n `.bat` \n ) files \\[\n [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1059/003/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\") \n ]. In some instances, the program attempts to remove all the volume shadow copies from a system \\[\n [T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1490/ \"Inhibit System Recovery\") \n ]. After the execution of the batch files, the executable removes the batch files from the victim\u2019s filesystem \\[\n [T1070\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1070/004/ \"Indicator Removal: File Deletion\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n The Snatch ransomware executable appends a series of hexadecimal characters to each file and folder name it encrypts\u2014unique to each infection\u2014and leaves behind a text file titled\n `HOW TO RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT` \n in each folder. Snatch threat actors communicate with their victims through email and the Tox communication platform based on identifiers left in ransom notes or through their extortion blog. Since November 2021, some victims reported receiving a spoofed call from an unknown female who claimed association with Snatch and directed them to the group\u2019s extortion site. In some instances, Snatch victims had a different ransomware variant deployed on their systems, but received a ransom note from Snatch threat actors. As a result, the victims\u2019 data is posted on the ransomware blog involving the different ransomware variant and on the Snatch threat actors\u2019 extortion blog.\n \n\n\n#### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n\n The Snatch IOCs detailed in this section were obtained through FBI investigations from September 2022 through June 2023\\.\n \n\n\n#### ***Email Domains and Addresses***\n\n\n\n Since 2019, Snatch threat actors have used numerous email addresses to email victims. Email addresses used by Snatch threat actors are random but usually originate from one of the following domains listed in Tables 1 and 2:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Malicious Email Domains Observed in Use by Snatch Threat Actors* \n\n| **Email Domains** |\n| --- |\n| sezname\\[.]cz |\n| cock\\[.]li |\n| airmail\\[.]cc |\n\n\n\n Table 2 shows a list of legitimate email domains offering encrypted email services that have been used by Snatch threat actors. These email domains are all publicly available and legal. The use of these email domains by a threat actor should not be attributed to the email domains, absent specific articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 2: Legitimate Email Domains Observed in Use by Snatch Threat Actors* \n\n| **Email Domains** |\n| --- |\n| tutanota\\[.]com / tutamail\\[.]com / tuta\\[.]io |\n|

The authoring agencies recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles and tactics into their software development practices for hardening software against ransomware attacks (e.g., to prevent threat actors from using Safe Mode to evade detection and file encryption), thus strengthening the secure posture for their customers.     For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s  [Secure by Design and Default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design and Default\")   webpage and  [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by- Design and -Default\")   . |\n| --- |\n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Snatch threat actor\u2019s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n* **Reduce threat of malicious actors** \n using remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Auditing remote access tools** \n\t on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized software.\n\t+ **Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software** \n\t to detect abnormal use of programs running as a portable executable \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.T](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t\n\t ].\n\t+ **Using security software** \n\t to detect instances of remote access software being loaded only in memory.\n\t+ **Requiring authorized remote access solutions** \n\t to be used only from within your network over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs).\n\t+ **Blocking both inbound and outbound connections** \n\t on common remote access software ports and protocols at the network perimeter.\n* **Implement application controls** \n to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs.\n\t+ Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n* **Strictly limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services** \n . If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]:\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ [Apply phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n\t\n\t .\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n* **Disable command\\-line and scripting** \n activities and permissions \\[\n [CPG 2\\.N](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\n ]\n \n .\n* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories** \n for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[\n [CPG 4\\.C]](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n .\n* **Audit user accounts with administrative privileges** \n and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Reduce the threat of credential compromise** \n via the following:\n\t+ **Place domain admin accounts in the protected users\u2019 group** \n\t to prevent caching of password hashes locally.\n\t+ Refrain from storing plaintext credentials in scripts.\n* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts** \n set at the admin level and higher \\[\n [CPG 2\\.A, 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\n ]\n \n .\n\n\n\n In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data** \n and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption to its business practices \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Require all accounts** \n with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\n **to comply** \n with\n [NIST's standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\") \n for developing and managing password policies.\n\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least eight characters and no more than 64 characters in length \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.B](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers.\n\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials.\n\t+ Avoid reusing passwords \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf) \n\t ].\n\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\n\t [CPG 2\\.G](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\t ].\n\t+ Disable password \u201chints.\u201d\n\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\n\t   \n\t\n\t**Note:** \n\t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.\n* **Require phishing\\-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)** \n for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats.

Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software** \n on all hosts.\n* **Disable unused** \n**ports and protocols** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.V](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n\n ].\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Disable hyperlinks** \n in received emails.\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI and CISA recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 4\\-16\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n FBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.stopransomware.gov/ \"#StopRansomware\") \n is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\n* Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack:\n [\\#StopRansomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\") \n .\n* No\\-cost cyber hygiene services:\n [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"CYBER HYGIENE SERVICES\") \n and\n [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"Ransomware Readiness Assessment CSET v10.3\") \n .\n\n\n### **REPORTING**\n\n\n\n The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Snatch threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI and CISA strongly discourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\\) at\n [ic3\\.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\") \n , a\n [local FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/ \"Field Offices\") \n , or to CISA at\n [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\") \n or 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA (1\\-844\\-729\\-2472\\).\n \n\n\n### **REFERENCES**\n\n\n\n \\[1]\n [DataBreaches.net](https://www.databreaches.net/at-some-point-snatch-team-stopped-being-the-snatch-ransomware-gang-were-journalists-the-last-to-know/ \"At some point, SNAtch Team stopped being the Snatch ransomware gang.
