Hitachi Energy recommends the following general mitigation factors and security practices:* Configure firewalls to protect process control networks from attacks originating from outside the network.* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Avoid directly connecting control systems to the internet.* Separate process control networks from other networks using a firewall system with a minimal number of exposed ports.* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system.* Enforce proper password policies and processes. For more information, see Hitachi Energy advisories [8DBD000155](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000155)  and [8DBD000166](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000166)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
