MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Yokogawa has recommended users upgrade the FCN/FCJ software to Version R4\\.20 or later and reports that some vulnerabilities are remediated in that version. Yokogawa has determined the fix for the memory exhaustion vulnerability is provided by that revision. For the remaining vulnerabilities of insufficiently protected credentials, session fixation, and use of hard\\-coded credentials, Yokogawa recommends users employ the packet filter function in FCN and recommend restricting communication to only the appropriate source. Furthermore, Yokogawa recommends users take measures with the network so communication data cannot be captured by untrusted third parties. Yokogawa strongly suggests all users introduce appropriate security measures not only for the vulnerabilities identified, but to the overall system. Yokogawa recommends users with questions related to this report (or on obtaining the updates) please utilize the product inquiry contact details at the following location:<http://stardom.biz/> Yokogawa\u2019s Security Advisory Report, YSAR\\-18\\-0004: Vulnerability of hardcoded password in STARDOM controllers, and YSAR\\-18\\-0007: Vulnerabilities in STARDOM controllers and other Yokogawa security reports are available at the following URL:[https://www.yokogawa.com/library/resources/white\\-papers/yokogawa\\-security\\-advisory\\-report\\-list/](https://www.yokogawa.com/library/resources/white-papers/yokogawa-security-advisory-report-list/)  Additionally, for questions related to these reports, please contact the following:[https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c\\-id\\=000498](https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c-id=000498) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 5 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize and restrict remote device access where remote access is not required.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
