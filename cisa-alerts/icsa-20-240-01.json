EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Red Lion\nEquipment: N-Tron 702-W / 702M12-W\nVulnerabilities: Reflected Cross-site Scripting, Stored Cross-site Scripting, Cross-site Request Forgery, Hidden Functionality, Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, execute system commands, and perform actions in the context of an attacked user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Red Lion products are affected:\n\nN-Tron 702-W: All versions\nN-Tron 702M12-W: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION (\u2018CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING\u2019) CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code and perform actions in the context of an attacked user.\nCVE-2020-16210 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION (\u2018CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING\u2019) CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code to gain access to sensitive data.\nCVE-2020-16206 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe affected product is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, which may allow an attacker to modify different configurations of a device by luring an authenticated user to click on a crafted link.\nCVE-2020-16208 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HIDDEN FUNCTIONALITY (BACKDOOR) CWE-912\nThe affected product is vulnerable due to an undocumented interface found on the device, which may allow an attacker to execute commands as root on the device.\nCVE-2020-16204 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF UNMAINTAINED THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS CWE-1104\nThe affected product is vulnerable due to outdated software components, which may allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information and take control of the device.\nCVE-2017-16544 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThomas Weber from SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRed Lion\u2019s 702-W Series was discontinued in 2018 and cannot be updated. Red Lion recommends these products be used locally within a secure network.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
