EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Advantech* **Equipment:**  WebAccess* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Access Control, Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of WebAccess are affected:* WebAccess Versions 8\\.3\\.2 and prior.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** During installation, the application installer disables user access control and does not re\\-enable it after the installation is complete. This could allow an attacker to run elevated arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2018\\-17908](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17908)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** The application fails to properly validate the length of user\\-supplied data, causing a buffer overflow condition that allows for arbitrary remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-17910](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17910)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  East Asia, United States, and Europe* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Mat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Advantech has released Version 8\\.3\\.3 of WebAccess to address the reported vulnerabilities. Users can download the latest version of WebAccess at the following location:[http://support.advantech.com/support/DownloadSRDetail\\_New.aspx?SR\\_ID\\=1\\-MS9MJV\\&Doc\\_Source\\=Download](http://support.advantech.com/support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-MS9MJV&Doc_Source=Download)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
