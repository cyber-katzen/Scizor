Sierra Wireless has discontinued the AirLink Raven X EV-DO and recommends that customers use GX400, GX440, or LS300 as replacements that mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Sierra Wireless versions are affected:\n\nAirLink Raven X EV-DO Versions V4221_4.0.11.003 and V4228_4.0.11.003\n\nIMPACT\nThese vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely reprogram the firmware on the device. After reprogramming the firmware, an attacker can affect functionality of the application, including system shutdown.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSierra Wireless is a Canadian company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, France, and China.\nThe affected product, AirLink Raven X EV-DO, is a gateway that provides connectivity to industrial, enterprise, and transportation organizations around the world. According to Sierra Wireless, AirLink Raven X EV-DO is deployed across the energy and transportation systems sectors. Sierra Wireless estimates that these products are used primarily in Canada, the United States, and Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATACWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html, web site last accessed January 14, 2014.\n\nThe AirLink Raven X EV-DO does not use encryption in the update and reprogramming process. By using the passwords and user names that are stored in plain text, an attacker could reprogram the firmware. This could allow the attacker to affect the availability of the firmware.\nCVE-2013-2819NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2819, web site last accessed January 14, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 14, 2014.\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAYCWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html, web site last accessed January 14, 2014.\n\nThe AirLink Raven X EV-DO is vulnerable to replay attacks that bypass authentication. By sending a series of crafted packets to Port 17336/UDP and Port 17388/UDP, an attacker could reprogram the device\u2019s firmware image. This could allow the attacker to affect the availability of the firmware.\nCVE-2013-2820NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2820, web site last accessed January 14, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 14, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 1 --------\nSierra Wireless has discontinued, but still supports the AirLink Raven X EV-DO product, and has provided mitigation suggestions in the following AirLink Raven Security Vulnerability report, dated May 28, 2014. This AirLink Product Notice may be downloaded directly at:\nhttp://www.sierrawireless.com/Support/Downloads/AirLink/Raven_Series/AirLink_Raven_X_EV-DO.aspx\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 ----------\nAdditional information and downloads can be found at:\nhttp://www.sierrawireless.com/Support.aspx\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
