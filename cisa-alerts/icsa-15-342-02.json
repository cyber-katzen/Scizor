[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryLOYTEC Router Information Exposure Vulnerability================================================ Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-342\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Maxim Rupp has identified a password file vulnerability in LOYTEC\u2019s LIP\\-3ECTB routers. LOYTEC has produced a firmware update to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following LOYTEC routers are affected:* LIP\\-3ECTB Version 6\\.0\\.1,* LINX\\-100,* LVIS\\-3E100, and* LIP\\-ME201IMPACT------ A backup file containing hashes of users\u2019 passwords can be downloaded. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- LOYTEC is headquartered in Germany and has distributors in the US and France. The affected product, LIP\\-3ECTB, is an IP network router device. This router is primarily found in the Critical Manufacturing and Energy sectors. LOYTEC estimates that this product is used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INFORMATION EXPOSURECWE\\-200: Information Exposure, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200\\.html, web site last accessed December 08, 2015\\. A backup file can be downloaded that contains the hash for users\u2019 passwords. CVE\\-2015\\-7906NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-7906, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.1 and a temporal score of 8\\.8 have been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:U/RC:R).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:U/RC:R, web site last accessed December 08, 2015\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would not be difficult. An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- LOYTEC has released a firmware update, V6\\.02, for these routers. LOYTEC recommends that customers update to the new firmware update, V6\\.02, which is available at the following URL:[https://www.loytec.com/support/download/cat\\_view/36\\-products?gid\\=92](https://www.loytec.com/support/download/cat_view/36-products?gid=92)  . ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
