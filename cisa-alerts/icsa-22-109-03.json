EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: FANUC Corporation / FANUC America Corporation\nEquipment: ROBOGUIDE\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Access Control, Path Traversal, Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service condition, allow for remote code execution, or provide unauthorized privilege escalation.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ROBOGUIDE, a simulation platform software suite for FANUC Robots, are affected:\n\nROBOGUIDE v9.40083.00.05 (Rev T) and earlier\u00a0\n\nNote: This offline simulation software program does not provide any control or management of physical devices or processes. It is included because it is used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS).\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nThe affected product is vulnerable to misconfigured binaries, allowing users on the target PC with SYSTEM level privileges access to overwrite the binary and modify files to gain privilege escalation.\nCVE-2021-38483 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe setup program for the affected product configures its files and folders with full access, which may allow unauthorized users permission to replace original binaries and achieve privilege escalation.\nCVE-2021-43986 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE 22\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a network-based attack by threat actors utilizing crafted naming conventions of files to gain unauthorized access rights.\nCVE-2021-43988 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a network-based attack by threat actors supplying a crafted, malicious XML payload designed to trigger an external entity reference call.\nCVE-2021-43990 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a network-based attack by threat actors sending unimpeded requests to the receiving server, which could cause a denial-of-service condition due to lack of heap memory resources.\nCVE-2021-43933 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan, United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSharon Brizinov with Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFANUC has created a new version to address these vulnerabilities. Users may obtain and install the new version by downloading ROBOGUIDE v9 Rev U or higher from the FANUC or FANUC America website (login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
