Previous versions, please contact customer care to inquire about upgrade paths.* EcoStruxure Power Operation with Advanced Reports and EcoStruxure Power SCADA Operation with Advanced Reports: A Hotfix for this vulnerability is available by contacting Contact Schneider Electric's [Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp)  . The Hotfix can be applied to versions EPO 2022, and 2021, the versions currently in support on the date of this disclosure. Previous versions, please contact customer care to inquire about upgrade paths. Schneider Electric also recommends the following cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to the Schneider Electric [Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/)  document.
