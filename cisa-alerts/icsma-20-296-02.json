MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 ---------\nB. Braun has released software updates to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities:\nWithin the United States and Canada:\nBattery pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 028U00093 (SN 138852 and lower).\nBattery pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 054U00093 (SN 138853 and higher).\nSpaceStation with SpaceCom 2, software Version 012U000093.\nFor details on acquiring this software, see the B. Braun Advisory.\nUsers in the United States and Canada who need additional support can contact B. Braun Technical Support by calling 800-627-PUMP or by emailing AISTechSupport@bbraunusa.com.\nNote: Facilities in Canada using \u201cU\u201d versions of software should follow the U.S. vulnerability disclosure. Facilities in Canada using non \u201cU\u201d versions (e.g. L) should follow the vulnerability disclosure for outside the U.S.\nOutside the United States and Canada:\n\nBattery Pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 027L000093 (below SN 138853).\nBattery pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 053L00093 (SN 138853 and higher).\nSpaceStation with SpaceCom 2, software version 011L000093.\n\nFor more information, see the B. Braun\u2019s Vulnerability Advisory.\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 1 ---------\nIn addition, B. Braun recommends users of the affected products consider the following best practices:\n\nAll facilities utilizing SpaceCom 2, and Battery Pack SP with Wi-Fi should review their IT infrastructure to ensure a network zone concept has been implemented whereby critical systems, such as infusion pumps, are housed in separate (e.g., by firewalls or VLAN) environments that are not accessible directly from the Internet or by unauthorized users.\nWireless networks should be implemented using industry standard encryption and should be equipped with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and/or intrusion prevention systems (IPS).\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n",
