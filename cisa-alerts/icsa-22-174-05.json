EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Elcomplus LLC\nEquipment: SmartICS\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Relative Path Traversal, Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to view files on the system or terminate processes on the system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nElcomplus reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SmartICS web-based HMI:\u00a0\n\nSmartICS v2.3.4.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\nThe software does not neutralize user-controllable input, which allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary code into specific parameters.\nCVE-2022-2140 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nThe software does not validate the filenames sufficiently, which enables authenticated administrator-level users to perform path traversal attacks and specify arbitrary files.\nCVE-2022-2106 \u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nAn authenticated user with admin privileges may be able to terminate any process on the system running SmartICS.\nCVE-2022-2088 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications, Commercial Facilities, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Russia\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nElcomplus has released Version 2.4 to address these vulnerabilities and recommends users update to the newest version. Users can obtain the new version on request at the official SmartICS website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
