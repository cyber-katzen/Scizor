EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Elcomplus LLC* **Equipment:**  SmartICS* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Access Control, Relative Path Traversal, Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to view files on the system or terminate processes on the system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Elcomplus reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SmartICS web\\-based HMI:* SmartICS v2\\.3\\.4\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) The software does not neutralize user\\-controllable input, which allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary code into specific parameters.[CVE\\-2022\\-2140](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2140)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE\\-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html) The software does not validate the filenames sufficiently, which enables authenticated administrator\\-level users to perform path traversal attacks and specify arbitrary files.[CVE\\-2022\\-2106](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2106)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) An authenticated user with admin privileges may be able to terminate any process on the system running SmartICS.[CVE\\-2022\\-2088](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2088)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Communications, Commercial Facilities, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Russia### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Elcomplus has released Version 2\\.4 to address these vulnerabilities and recommends users update to the newest version. Users can obtain the new version on request at the [official SmartICS website](https://smartics.io/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
