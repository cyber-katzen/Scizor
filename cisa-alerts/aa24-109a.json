[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity Advisory\\#StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware================================== Release Date April 18, 2024 Alert Code AA24\\-109A Related topics: , , [Incident Detection, Response, and Prevention](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/incident-detection-response-and-prevention) #### Actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from Akira ransomware:1. Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.2. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, VPN, and accounts that access critical systems.3. Regularly patch and update software and applications to their latest version and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.### **SUMMARY*****Note:**  This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* [*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.*  The United States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3\\), and the Netherlands\u2019 National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC\\-NL)\u00a0are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Akira ransomware\u00a0IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations and trusted third party reporting as recently as February 2024\\. Since March 2023, Akira ransomware has impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure entities in North America, Europe, and Australia. In April 2023, following an initial focus on Windows systems,\u00a0Akira threat actors deployed a Linux variant targeting VMware ESXi virtual machines. As of January 1, 2024, the ransomware group has impacted over 250 organizations and claimed approximately $42 million (USD) in ransomware proceeds. Early versions of the Akira\u00a0ransomware variant were written in C\\+\\+ and encrypted files with a `.akira`  extension; however, beginning in August 2023, some Akira attacks began deploying Megazord, using Rust\\-based code which encrypts files with a `.powerranges`  extension.\u00a0\u00a0Akira threat actors have continued to use both Megazord and Akira, including Akira\\_v2 (identified by trusted third party investigations) interchangeably. The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC\\-NL encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.

See [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\")  for all referenced tactics and techniques.#### **Initial Access** The FBI and cybersecurity researchers have observed Akira threat actors obtaining initial access to organizations through a virtual private network (VPN) service without multifactor authentication (MFA) configured\\[ [1](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-akira \"Ransomware Roundup - Akira\")  ], mostly using known Cisco vulnerabilities \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\")  ] [CVE\\-2020\\-3259](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3259 \"CVE-2020-3259\")  and [CVE\\-2023\\-20269](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20269 \"CVE-2023-20269\")  .\\[ [2](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/akira-ransomware-targeting-vpns-without-multi-factor-authentication \"Akira Ransomware Targeting VPNs without Multi-Factor Authentication\")  ],\\[ [3](https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/akira-ransomware-and-exploitation-of-cisco-anyconnect-vulnerability-cve-2020-3259 \"Akira Ransomware and Exploitation of Cisco Anyconnect Vulnerability CVE-2020-3259\")  ],\\[ [4](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-akira \"Ransomware Spotlight: Akira\")  ] Additional methods of initial access include the use of external\\-facing services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) \\[ [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\")  ],\u00a0spear phishing \\[ [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/001/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\")  ]\\[ [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/002/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\")  ], and the abuse of valid credentials\\[ [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\")  ].\\[ [4](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-akira \"Ransomware Spotlight: Akira\")  ]#### **Persistence and Discovery** Once initial access is obtained, Akira threat actors attempt to abuse the functions of domain controllers by creating new domain accounts \\[ [T1136\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1136/002/ \"Create Account: Domain Account\")  ] to establish persistence. In some instances, the FBI identified Akira threat actors creating an administrative account named `itadm`  . According to FBI and open source reporting, Akira threat actors leverage post\\-exploitation attack techniques, such as Kerberoasting\\[ [5](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/kerberoasting/ \"KERBEROASTING ATTACKS\")  ], to extract credentials stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) \\[ [T1003\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/001/ \"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\")  ] . \\[ [6](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/12/21/akira-again-the-ransomware-that-keeps-on-taking/ \"Akira, again: The ransomware that keeps on taking\")  ] Akira threat actors also use credential scraping tools \\[ [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/ \"OS Credential Dumping\")  ] like\u00a0Mimikatz and\u00a0LaZagne\u00a0to aid in privilege escalation. Tools like SoftPerfect and Advanced IP Scanner are often used for network device discovery (reconnaissance) purposes \\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ] and `net`  Windows commands are used to identify domain controllers \\[ [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\")  ] and gather information on domain trust relationships \\[ [T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1482 \"Domain Trust Discovery\")  ]. See Table 1 for a descriptive listing of these tools.#### **Defense Evasion** Based on trusted third party investigations, Akira threat actors have been observed deploying two distinct ransomware variants against different system architectures within the same compromise event. This marks a shift from recently reported Akira ransomware activity. Akira threat actors were first observed deploying the Windows\\-specific \u201cMegazord\u201d ransomware, with further analysis revealing that a second payload was concurrently deployed in this attack (which was later identified as a novel variant of the Akira ESXi encryptor, \u201cAkira\\_v2\u201d). As Akira threat actors prepare for lateral movement, they commonly disable security software to avoid detection. Cybersecurity researchers have observed Akira threat actors using PowerTool to exploit the Zemana AntiMalware driver\\[ [4](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-akira \"Ransomware Spotlight: Akira\")  ] and terminate antivirus\\-related processes \\[ [T1562\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1562/001 \"Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\")  ].#### **Exfiltration and Impact** Akira\u00a0threat actors leverage tools such as\u00a0FileZilla, WinRAR \\[ [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/001/ \"Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\")  ], WinSCP, and\u00a0RClone to exfiltrate data \\[ [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1048/ \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\")  ]. To establish command and control channels, threat actors leverage readily available tools like AnyDesk, MobaXterm, RustDesk,\u00a0Ngrok, and Cloudflare Tunnel, enabling exfiltration through various protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and cloud storage services like Mega \\[ [T1537](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1537 \"Transfer Data to Cloud Account\")  ] to connect to exfiltration servers. Akira threat actors use a double\\-extortion model \\[ [T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/ \"Financial Theft\")  ] and encrypt systems \\[ [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\")  ] after exfiltrating data. The Akira ransom note provides each company with a unique code and instructions to contact the threat actors via `a\u00a0.onion`  URL.\u00a0Akira threat actors do not leave an initial ransom demand or payment instructions on compromised networks, and do not relay this information until contacted by the victim.\u00a0Ransom payments are paid in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses provided by the threat actors. To further apply pressure, Akira threat actors threaten to publish exfiltrated data on the Tor network, and in some instances have called victimized companies, according to FBI reporting.#### **Encryption** Akira threat actors utilize a sophisticated hybrid encryption scheme to lock data. This involves combining a ChaCha20\u00a0stream cipher with an RSA public\\-key cryptosystem for speed and secure key exchange \\[ [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\")  ]. This multilayered approach tailors encryption methods based on file type and size and is capable of full or partial encryption.\u00a0Encrypted files are appended with either a `.akira`  or `.powerranges`  extension. To further inhibit system recovery, Akira\u2019s encryptor ( `w.exe`  ) utilizes\u00a0PowerShell commands to delete volume shadow copies (VSS) on Windows systems \\[ [T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1490 \"Inhibit System Recovery\")  ]. Additionally, a ransom note named `fn.txt`  appears in both the root directory ( `C:`  ) and each users\u2019 home directory ( `C:\\Users`  ). Trusted third party analysis identified that the Akira\\_v2 encryptor is an upgrade from its previous version, which includes additional functionalities due to the language it\u2019s written in (Rust). Previous versions of the encryptor provided options to insert arguments at runtime, including:* `-p --encryption_path (targeted file/folder paths)`* `-s --share_file (targeted network drive path)`* `-n --encryption_percent (percentage of encryption)`* `--fork (create a child process for encryption` The ability to insert additional threads allows Akira threat actors to have more granular control over the number of CPU cores in use, increasing the speed and efficiency of the encryption process. The new version also adds a layer of protection, utilizing the Build ID as a run condition to hinder dynamic analysis. The encryptor is unable to execute successfully without the unique Build ID. The ability to deploy against only virtual machines using \u201c `vmonly`  \u201d and the ability to stop running virtual machines with \u201c `stopvm`  \u201d functionalities have also been observed implemented for Akira\\_v2\\. After encryption, the Linux ESXi variant may include the file extension \u201c `akiranew`  \u201d or add a ransom note named \u201c `akiranew.txt`  \u201d in directories where files were encrypted with the new nomenclature.#### **Leveraged Tools** Table 1 lists publicly available tools and applications Akira threat actors have used, including legitimate tools repurposed for their operations. Use of these tools and applications should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control.*Table 1: Tools Leveraged by Akira Ransomware Actors* | **Name** | **Description** || --- | --- || [AdFind](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0552/ \"AdFind\") | `AdFind.exe`   is used to query and retrieve information from Active Directory. || Advanced IP Scanner | A network scanner is used to locate all the computers on a network and conduct a scan of their ports.

**MITIGATIONS**#### **Network Defenders** The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC\\-NL recommend organizations apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the risk of compromise by Akira ransomware. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.* **Implement a recovery plan**  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud) \\[ [CPG 2\\.F](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F \"Network Segmentation (2.F)\")  , [2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\")  , [2\\.S](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#IncidentResponseIRPlans2S \"Incident Response (IR) Plans (2.S)\")  ].* **Require all accounts**  with password logins (e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) **to comply**  with NIST\u2019s [standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/\")  . In particular, require employees to use long passwords and consider not requiring recurring password changes, as these can weaken security\u00a0\\[ [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#UniqueCredentials2C \"Unique Credentials (2.C)\")  ].* **Require multifactor authentication**  for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems \\[ [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H \"Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA) (2.H)\")  ].* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.**  Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")  in internet\\-facing systems. \\[ [CPG 1\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E \"Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (1.E)\")  ].* **Segment networks**  to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement \\[ [CPG 2\\.F](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F \"Network Segmentation (2.F)\")  ].* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.**  To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[ [CPG 3\\.A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A \"Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)\")  ].* **Filter network traffic**  by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services on internal systems. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services that they have established for persistence.* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software**  on all hosts.* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories**  for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[ [CPG 1\\.A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#AssetInventory1A \"Asset Inventory (1.A)\")  , [2\\.O](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DocumentDeviceConfigurations2O \"Document Device Configurations (2.O)\")  ].* **Audit user accounts**  with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege \\[ [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E \"Separating User and Privileged Accounts (2.E)\")  ].* **Disable unused** **ports**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.V](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#ProhibitConnectionofUnauthorizedDevices2V \"Prohibit Connection of Unauthorized Devices (2.V)\")  ].* **Consider adding an email banner to emails**  received from outside of your organization \\[ [CPG 2\\.M](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#EmailSecurity2M \"Email Security (2.M)\")  ].* **Disable hyperlinks**  in received emails.* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.**  For example, the Just\\-in\\-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the [Zero Trust model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model \"Zero Trust Maturity Model\")  ). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.* **Disable command\\-line and scripting activities and permissions.**  Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally \\[ [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E \"Separating User and Privileged Accounts (2.E)\")  , [2\\.N](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N \"Disable Macros by Default (2.N)\")  ].* **Maintain offline backups of data,**  and regularly maintain backup and restoration \\[ [CPG 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\")  ]. By instituting this practice, the organization helps ensure they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable**  (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[ [CPG 2\\.K](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#StrongandAgileEncryption2K \"Strong and Agile Encryption (2.K)\")  , [2\\.L](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureSensitiveData2L \"Secure Sensitive Data (2.L)\")  , [2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R \"System Backups (2.R)\")  ].### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC\\-NL recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI, CISA, EC3 and NCSC\\-NL recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 6 \\-14\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC\\-NL recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.### **RESOURCES*** [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.stopransomware.gov/ \"#StopRansomware\")  is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.* Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: [\\#StopRansomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide \"Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) #StopRansomware Guide\")  .* No cost cyber hygiene services: [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"Cyber Hygiene Services\")  , [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"Ransomware Readiness Assessment CSET v10.3\")  .### **REFERENCES**1.

If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to the FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws. The FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Akira threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. Additional details of interest include: a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host\\- and network\\-based indicators. The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC\\-NL do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI\u2019s [Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3\\)](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)\")  , a local FBI[Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\")  , or CISA via the agency\u2019s [Incident Reporting System](https://www.cisa.gov/forms/report \"Incident Reporting System\")  or its 24/7 Operations Center ( [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\")  or by calling 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA (1\\-844\\-729\\-2472\\).### **DISCLAIMER** The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
