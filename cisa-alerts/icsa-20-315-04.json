TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports the vulnerability affects the following products:* SIMATIC S7\\-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): All versions* SINUMERIK 840D sl: All versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SIMATIC TDC CPU555: All versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) An attacker may send multiple specially crafted packets to the affected devices, which may cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition. A cold restart is required to recover the service.[CVE\\-2020\\-15783](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15783)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER WangFangLi from Beijing Winicssec Technology CO reported this vulnerability to Siemens.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens is preparing updates and recommends users protect network access to Port 102/TCP of affected devices. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:<https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-492828](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/SSA-492828.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.
