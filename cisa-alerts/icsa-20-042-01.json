MITIGATIONS--------------- SSS makes the following recommendations to mitigate risk.* Upgrade to firmware Version 5\\.1\\.2 or higher. Consult with SSS for possible issues during upgrade, prior to implementing this recommendation.* Implement network segmentation and firewall policies to reduce exposure of the RTU to uncontrolled and unprotected access.* Follow recommended security practices and configure firewalls to help protect an industrial control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include ensuring that protection, control, and automation systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and other practices to be evaluated case by case.* Do not allow the use of protection, control, and automation systems for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Block all nontrusted IP communications.* Configure trusted IP address access (IP whitelisting) in the RTU configuration for IEC\\-104 protocol to restrict hosts that can access the RTU.* Implement passwords in the RTU to restrict access to the RTU, via Husky Studio.* If possible, set up an SSL tunnel between the RTU and control center to restrict access to the RTU.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For more information, see the associated\u00a0SSS [security bulletin](http://www.s3india.com/security_bulletins_rtu.html)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .
