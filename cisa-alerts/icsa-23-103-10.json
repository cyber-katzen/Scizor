MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet, available:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC CP 443-1 (6GK7443-1EX30-0XE0): Update to\u00a0V3.3\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nSIMATIC CP 443-1 (6GK7443-1EX30-0XE1): Update to\u00a0V3.3\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nSIMATIC CP 443-1 Advanced (6GK7443-1GX30-0XE0): Update to\u00a0V3.3\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nSIPLUS TIM 1531 IRC (6AG1543-1MX00-7XE0): Update to\u00a0V2.3.6\u00a0or later version\u00a0\nTIM 1531 IRC (6GK7543-1MX00-0XE0): Update to\u00a0V2.3.6\u00a0or later version\u00a0\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nRestrict access to the web interface of the affected products\u2014if deactivation unsupported by the product.\u00a0\nDeactivate the webserver if not required and if deactivation is supported by the product.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security\u00a0and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens\u00a0webpage for Industrial Security.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens\u2019 products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-566905 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0\n",
