[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryFATEK Automation PLC WinProladder Stack\\-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability============================================================================ Last Revised April 08, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-350\\-01OVERVIEW-------- A researcher working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) has identified a stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability in FATEK Automation's PLC WinProladder application. Fatek Automation (Fatek) has not produced an update to mitigate this vulnerability. ZDI has coordinated with NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT. ZDI will publish the PLC WinProladder vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following PLC WinProladder version is affected:* PLC WinProladder Version 3\\.11 Build 14701IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of the reported vulnerability may allow an attacker to perform a number of malicious actions including arbitrary code execution. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- FATEK Automation is a Taiwan\\-based company that maintains distribution offices in several countries around the world. The affected product, PLC WinProladder, is a PLC programming software. According to Fatek, this product is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities and Critical Manufacturing. Fatek estimates that this product is used primarily in Europe and Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-121: Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, web site last accessed December 15, 2016\\. A stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when the software application connects to a malicious server, resulting in a stack buffer overflow. This causes an exploitable Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite condition that may allow remote code execution. CVE\\-2016\\-8377NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-8377, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 15, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- FATEK Automation has not responded to requests to work with ICS\\-CERT to mitigate this vulnerability. ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
