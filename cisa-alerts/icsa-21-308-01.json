EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: VISAM\nEquipment: VBASE\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Cross-site Scripting, Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow un-neutralized user-controllable data input, disclosure of local files, access to NTLM (Windows New Technology LAN Manager) hashes, and access to sensitive files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of VISAM VBASE Editor, an automation platform, are affected:\n\nVBASE Pro-RT/ Server-RT (Web Remote): Version 11.6.0.6\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe affected product is vulnerable to improper access control via the web-remote endpoint, which may allow an unauthenticated user viewing access to folders and files in the directory listing.\nCVE-2021-38417\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before the data is placed in output used as a public-facing webpage.\nCVE-2021-42535 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611\nThe affected software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\nCVE-2021-42537 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USING COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES CWE-1035\nThe affected product relies on third-party components that are not actively supported or maintained by the original developer or a trusted proxy. The following CVEs are associated with this product.\nCVE-2021-34803, CVE-2020-13699, CVE-2019-18988, CVE-2018-16550, CVE-2018-14333, CVE-2005-2475 have been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nVISAM recommends users update to VBASE v11.7.0.2 or later. Users may obtain a download link by submitting a request form.\nFor more information, please contact VISAM using the information provided on the company contact page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
