RISK EVALUATION\n\u202fSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability results in full access to the database.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\u202f\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SICAM TOOLBOX II, a control and monitoring system, are affected:\n\nSICAM TOOLBOX II: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\u202f3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nSICAM TOOLBOX II contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker access through a circumventable access control. This could allow an attacker to access the database.\nCVE-2021-45106 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThomas Riedmaier from Siemens and Matan Dobrushin and Eran Jacob from OTORIO reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nNote: There is currently no remediation available from Siemens.\nSiemens recommends users take the following measures for the affected product and versions:\n\nInstall hotfix V7.01 HF01. This update disables the port 1522 in the ORACLE configuration file LISTENER.ORA by default. The currently installed and/or user modified configuration file LISTENER.ORA is backed up. See the release notes for more information.\u00a0\nAlternatively, restrict port 1522/tcp access to localhost or specific IP addresses as documented in the updated security manual (chapter 3.6.7), which is also included in the SICAM TOOLBOX II, V07.01 package.\n\nRegulations usually require operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide to build resilience into power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. Siemens recommends operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can be minimized the grid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, users may utilize an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances.\u00a0\nSiemens recommends prior validation of any security update before application, and trained staff supervision of the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nSiemens provides additional information on industrial security on the Siemens Industrial Security webpage.\u00a0\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-669737.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
