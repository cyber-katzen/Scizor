MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions:* SIMATIC ITC1500 V3: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/)* SIMATIC ITC1500 V3 PRO: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/)* SIMATIC ITC1900 V3: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/)* SIMATIC ITC1900 V3 PRO: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/)* SIMATIC ITC2200 V3: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/)* SIMATIC ITC2200 V3 PRO: [Update to v3\\.2\\.1\\.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109804128/) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Monitor and restrict access to Port 5900/TCP to trusted IP addresses only As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> Please see Siemens\u2019 security advisory [SSA\\-390195](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-390195.pdf)  for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
