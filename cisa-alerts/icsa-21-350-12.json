EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC ITC Products\nVulnerabilities: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these LibVNC vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial-of-service attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SIMATIC Industrial Thin Clients:\n\nSIMATIC ITC1500 V3: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\nSIMATIC ITC1500 V3 PRO: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\nSIMATIC ITC1900 V3: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\nSIMATIC ITC1900 V3 PRO: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\nSIMATIC ITC2200 V3: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\nSIMATIC ITC2200 V3 PRO: All versions prior to v3.2.1.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USING COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES CWE-1035\nMultiple LibVNC vulnerabilities in the affected products could allow remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial-of-service attacks under certain conditions.\nCVE-2017-18922, CVE-2018-20019, CVE-2018-20748, CVE-2018-20749, CVE-2018-20750, CVE-2018-21247, CVE-2019-15681, CVE-2019-15690, CVE-2019-20788, CVE-2019-20839, CVE-2019-20840, CVE-2020-14396, CVE-2020-14397, CVE-2020-14398, CVE-2020-14401, CVE-2020-14402, CVE-2020-14403, CVE-2020-14404, CVE-2020-14405 have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions:\n\nSIMATIC ITC1500 V3: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\nSIMATIC ITC1500 V3 PRO: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\nSIMATIC ITC1900 V3: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\nSIMATIC ITC1900 V3 PRO: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\nSIMATIC ITC2200 V3: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\nSIMATIC ITC2200 V3 PRO: Update to v3.2.1.0 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nMonitor and restrict access to Port 5900/TCP to trusted IP addresses only\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nPlease see Siemens\u2019 security advisory SSA-390195 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
