Adcon Telemetry has produced a new firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following A850 Telemetry Gateway Base Station versions are affected:\n\nA850 Telemetry Gateway Base Station, all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the injection of arbitrary JavaScript that may affect the integrity of the system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdcon Telemetry is an Austria-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, Germany, and Austria.\nThe affected product, A850 Telemetry Gateway Base Station, is a wireless telemetry system. According to Adcon Telemetry, A850 Telemetry Gateway Base Stations are deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Adcon Telemetry estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\n\nThe Web Interface does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in the output, this could allow for cross-site scripting.\nCVE-2016-2274NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2274, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed December 08, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nAdcon Telemetry has produced a new firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability. Adcon recommends users contact its distributor for information on how to obtain the new firmware version.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
