EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit.\nVendor: Omron\nEquipment: CX-One\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Type Confusion.\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CX-One are affected:\n\nCX-One Versions 4.42 and prior, including the following applications:\nCX-FLnet versions 1.00 and prior,\nCX-Protocol versions 1.992 and prior,\nCX-Programmer versions 9.65 and prior,\nCX-Server versions 5.0.22 and prior,\nNetwork Configurator versions 3.63 and prior, and\nSwitch Box Utility versions 1.68 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW\u00a0CWE-122\nParsing malformed project files may cause a heap-based buffer overflow.\nCVE-2018-8834 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nParsing malformed project files may cause a stack-based buffer overflow.\nCVE-2018-7514 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE (TYPE CONFUSION) CWE-843\nParsing malformed project files may allow the pointer to call an incorrect object resulting in an access of resource using incompatible type condition.\nCVE-2018-7530 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRgod, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOmron has released an updated version of CX-One to address the reported vulnerabilities. These releases are available through the CX-One auto-update service.\n\nCX-FLnet version 1.10,\nCX-Protocol version 1.993,\nCX-Programmer versions 9.66,\nCommon Module including CX-Server version 5.0.23,\nNetwork Configurator version 3.64, and\nSwitch Box Utility version 1.69\n\nNCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
