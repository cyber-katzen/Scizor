RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow elevation of privileges which could result in arbitrary file deletion with system privileges.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports that the following versions of Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software are affected:\n\nEasy UPS Online Monitoring Software (Windows 10, 11, Windows\n\tServer 2016, 2019, 2022): 2.6-GA-01-23116 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Path Traversal CWE-22\nA path traversal vulnerability exists that could cause arbitrary file deletion upon service restart when accessed by a local and low-privileged attacker.\nCVE-2023-6407\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\n06fe5fd2bc53027c4a3b7e395af0b850e7b8a044 working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and Tenable Network Security reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nVersion 2.6-GA-01-23248 of Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software\u00a0includes a fix for the vulnerabilities for Microsoft supported versions of Windows 10, 11, Windows Server 2016, 2019 & 2022 and is available for download.\nThe Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software has been discontinued coinciding with the discontinuation of the Easy UPS Online SNMP Cards (APV9601, APVS9601) managed by this software.\nSchneider Electric recommends that users currently using Easy UPS Online Monitoring Software to manage Easy UPS Online (SRV/SRVS) should transition to PowerChute Serial Shutdown for serial/USB shutdown and monitoring; and to PowerChute Network Shutdown for network shutdown and monitoring. For more information about PowerChute software please see the following:\n\nhttps://www.apc.com/pcss\nhttps://www.apc.com/pcns\n\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends users follow cybersecurity industry best practices, including:\u202f\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\nPlace all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode.\nNever connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\nScan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nNever allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nFor more information on cybersecurity industry best practices, refer to the\u202fSchneider Electric recommended cybersecurity best practices document.\nFor more information on this vulnerability and the associated mitigations, see\u00a0Schneider Electric vulnerability disclosure SEVD-2023-346-03.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nDecember 12, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
