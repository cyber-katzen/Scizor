EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ABB\nEquipment: System 800xA Base\nVulnerability: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and cause system functions to stop or malfunction.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of System 800xA Base are affected:\n\nSystem 800xA Base: Versions 6.0 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nLow privileged users can read and modify registry settings used to control system functionality.\nCVE-2020-8474 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nWilliam Knowles of Applied Risk reported this vulnerability to ABB.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB recommends changing any user account passwords suspected to be known by an unauthorized person. Interactive logon (both local and remote) is recommended to be disabled for the service account.\nThis vulnerability is corrected in System 800xA Base 6.1\nThis vulnerability is planned to be corrected in the next release on the 6.0.3 LTS track after 6.0.3.3\nPlease note this vulnerability can only be exploited by authenticated users, so users are recommended to ensure only authorized persons have access to user accounts in System 800xA.\nFor more information please refer to ABB\u2019s Cybersecurity Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\u00a0\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
