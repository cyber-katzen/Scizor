OSIsoft has produced a new version of PI SQL Data Access Server (OLE DB) 2016 (1.5) to address this issue.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAffected versions of PI SQL Data Access Server prior to the 2016 (1.5)\u00a0release are included only with:\n\nPI JDBC Driver\u00a02015 (1.4.1.404)\u00a0 and earlier, and\nPI ODBC Driver\u00a02015 (3.5.403) and earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could cause the PI SQL Data Access Server to stop responding in a way that may cause an incomplete update resulting in partial data loss.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\u00a0\nBACKGROUND\nOSIsoft is a US-based company that maintains headquarters in San Leandro, California, with global operations.\nAccording to OSIsoft, the PI SQL Data Access Server is a component that supports the PI SQL family of drivers such as PI ODBC and PI JDBC. While these drivers implement a certain industry standard or API and build the interface to third-party clients or applications, PI SQL Data Access Server is responsible for executing the queries. PI SQL Data Access Server supports connections and queries to the PI Data Archive and PI AF Server. PI SQL Data Access Server is a layered application that is not installed with every PI System implementation. PI Asset Framework is deployed across several critical infrastructure sectors. These products are used worldwide.\u00a0\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER\u00a0INPUT\u00a0VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed June 14, 2016.\n\nA denial-of-service impact occurs when the PI SQL Data Access Server improperly handles input while processing a message from an authenticated connection.\nCVE-2016-4530NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4530, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. The issue was rated by OSIsoft using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)CVSS Calculator, https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?adv&calculator&version=2, web site last accessed June 14, 2016.\u00a0as Medium (CVSS: 4.0-6.9)\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nOSIsoft recommends upgrading to PI SQL Data Access Server (OLE DB) 2016 (1.5) to address this issue.\nOSIsoft recommends that users use a host-based firewall to limit access to Ports 5461 and 5462 only to trusted workstations and PI SQL client products such as:\n\nPI JDBC Driver, and\nPI ODBC Driver.\n\nThey also recommend that access to PI SQL Data Access Server be limited to only those users who need it through user rights assignment security policy.\nFor more information on this vulnerability, please refer to OSIsoft\u2019s Security Bulletin on this topic that was released on its web site on May 10, 2016:\nhttps://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/PI-System-Cyber-Security\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
