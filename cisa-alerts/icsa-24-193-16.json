RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve information such as users and passwords.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports that the following versions of SIMATIC WinCC are affected:\n \n\n\n* Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9\\.1: all versions\n* Siemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V18: all versions\n* Siemens SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V19: all versions\n* Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.4: versions prior to V7\\.4 SP1 Update 23\n* Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.5: versions prior to V7\\.5 SP2 Update 17\n* Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V8\\.0: versions prior to V8\\.0 Update 5\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### **3\\.2\\.1** \n[**EXPOSURE OF PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE\\-359**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html)\n\n\n\n The affected products do not properly handle certain requests to their web application, which may lead to the leak of privileged information. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve information such as users and passwords.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2024\\-30321](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-30321) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\n [CVE\\-2024\\-30321](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-30321) \n . A base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS4\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Critical Manufacturing\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Germany\n\n\n### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n \n\n\n4\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.\n \n\n\n* SIMATIC PCS 7 V9\\.1:\n [Update WinCC to V7\\.5 SP2 Update 17 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793460/)\n* SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.4:\n [Update to V7\\.4 SP1 Update 23 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109955792/)\n* SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.5:\n [Update to V7\\.5 SP2 Update 17 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793460/)\n* SIMATIC WinCC V8\\.0:\n [Update to V8\\.0 Update 5 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109818723/)\n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* Restrict access to application webserver for trusted users only\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n\n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-883918 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-883918.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-883918.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n \n\n\n5\\.
