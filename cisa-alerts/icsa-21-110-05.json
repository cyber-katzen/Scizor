EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: CNCSoft-B\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, Out-of-bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of CNCSoft-B, a software management platform, are affected:\n\nCNCSoft-B Versions 1.0.0.3 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-22660 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-22664 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics has released an updated version of CNCSoft-B and recommends users install v1.0.0.4 or later on all affected systems.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
