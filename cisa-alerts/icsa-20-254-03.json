A CVSS v3 base score of 2\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Sweden### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Parth Srivastava of Protiviti India Member Private Limited reported this vulnerability to HMS Networks.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- HMS Networks recommends the following mitigations:* Update firmware to the [latest version](https://ewon.biz/technical-support/pages/all-downloads)  available.* Use secure Talk2M cloud solutions to create a VPN tunnel connecting Ewon devices remotely.* Do not publicly expose the WAN IP of your devices on the internet.* Use the WAN firewall, which is built into all Ewon devices. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Practice principles of [least privilege](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege)  .* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .
