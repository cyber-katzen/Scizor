Therefore, Siemens recommends determining if it is possible that untrusted code can be run on these systems, or if existing measures implemented by the operator reduce the likelihood of untrusted code being run.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring e the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor additional information see Siemens\u2019 security advisory SSA-377318 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm\nAdditional information regarding the Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) see:\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00141.html\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
