EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Weintek\nEquipment: EasyBuilder Pro\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain remote control of a victim's computer as a privileged user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Weintek products are affected:\n\nEasyBuilder Pro: Versions prior to v6.07.02\nEasyBuilder Pro: Versions 6.08.01.592 and prior\nEasyBuilder Pro: Versions 6.08.02.470 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected product contains a vulnerability that, even when the private key is immediately deleted after the crash report transmission is finished, the private key is exposed to the public, which could result in obtaining remote control of the crash report server.\nCVE-2023-5777\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHank Chen (PSIRT and Threat Research of TXOne Networks) reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWeintek recommends users apply the following mitigations:\n\nUpdate EasyBuilder Pro to\u00a0v6.08.01.614\nUpdate EasyBuilder Pro to\u00a0v6.08.02.500\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
