Siemens has identified two vulnerabilities in SIMATIC WinCC, PCS 7, and WinCC Runtime Professional. Sergey Temnikov and Vladimir Dashchenko from Kaspersky Lab reported these issues directly to Siemens. Siemens has produced updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products:* SIMATIC WinCC:\t+ V7\\.0 SP 2: All versions prior to V7\\.0 SP2 Update 12,\t+ V7\\.0 SP 3: All versions prior to V7\\.0 SP3 Update 8,\t+ V7\\.2: All versions prior to 7\\.2 Update 13,\t+ V7\\.3: All versions prior to 7\\.3 Update 10, and\t+ V7\\.4: All versions prior to 7\\.4 Update 1* SIMATIC PCS 7 (WinCC, Batch, Route Control, OPEN PCS 7\\):\t+ V7\\.1 SP4: all versions prior toV7\\.1 SP4 with WinCC V7\\.0 SP2 Update 12,\t+ ### \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\t+ V8\\.0: All versions prior to V8\\.0 SP2 with WinCC V7\\.2 Update 13,\t+ ### \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update C Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\t+ V8\\.1: All versions prior to 8\\.1 SP1 with WinCC V7\\.3 Update 10, and\t+ V8\\.2: All versions prior to 8\\.2 with WinCC V7\\.4 Update 1* SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: All versions prior to V13 SP 1 Update 9IMPACT------ Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities could possibly extract arbitrary files or remotely execute arbitrary code. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. The affected products are: SIMATIC WinCC, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system; and SIMATIC PCS7, a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC. These products are deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE\\-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\\.html, web site last accessed July 26, 2016\\.

For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-378531 at the following location:[http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert\\-security\\-advisories.htm](http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm)  As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to the WinCC and PCS 7 stations with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.[https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
