EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Measuresoft\nEquipment: ScadaPro Server and Client\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Use After Free, Link Following.\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ScadaPro, a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, are affected:\n\nScadaPro Server and Client: All Versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\nScadaPro Server uses unmaintained ActiveX controls. The controls may allow seven untrusted pointer deference instances while processing a specific project file.\nCVE-2022-2894 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nScadaPro Server uses unmaintained ActiveX controls. These controls may allow two stack-based buffer overflow instances while processing a specific project file.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2895 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nScadaPro Server allows use after free while processing a specific project file.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2896 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LINK RESOLUTION BEFORE FILE ACCESS ('LINK FOLLOWING') CWE-59\nScadaPro Server and ScadaPro Server Client do not properly resolve links before file access; this could allow privilege escalation.\nCVE-2022-2897 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LINK RESOLUTION BEFORE FILE ACCESS ('LINK FOLLOWING') CWE-59\nScadaPro Server and ScadaPro Server Client do not properly resolve links before file access; this could allow a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2022-2898 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy, Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAndrea Micalizzi (@rgod777), working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative; and Michael DePlante (@izobashi) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMeasuresoft is aware of the issues reported and is developing mitigations.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\nOnly use project files originating from known, trusted sources.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
