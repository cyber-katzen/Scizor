MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends applying updates, where available:* SICAM MMU: Update to [v2\\.05](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/products/7kg9663-1aa00-1aa0)* SICAM SGU: For RTU applications, upgrade the discontinued SICAM SGU devices to SICAM A8000 RTUs.* SICAM T: Update to [v2\\.18](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/products/7kg9661-1aa00-1aa0) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:* The firmware updates to SICAM T and SICAM MMU introduce authentication to the web application and remove some unnecessary functionality. The web authentication functionality reduces the risk of access to the device\u2019s web application for executing administrative commands by unauthenticated users.* Due to hardware constraints, encryption is not possible on the devices. Confidential data such as passwords handled by the devices need to be protected on the network by other means, e.g., by VPN.* The risk for remote code execution and unauthenticated firmware installation can be mitigated by ensuring encryption and authentication between the user and the device, e.g., by VPN.* Use a modern and up to date browser. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-305120](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-305120.pdf)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to A [voiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
