MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends applying updates, where available:\n\nSICAM MMU: Update to v2.05\nSICAM SGU: For RTU applications, upgrade the discontinued SICAM SGU devices to SICAM A8000 RTUs.\nSICAM T: Update to v2.18\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nThe firmware updates to SICAM T and SICAM MMU introduce authentication to the web application and remove some unnecessary functionality. The web authentication functionality reduces the risk of access to the device\u2019s web application for executing administrative commands by unauthenticated users.\nDue to hardware constraints, encryption is not possible on the devices. Confidential data such as passwords handled by the devices need to be protected on the network by other means, e.g., by VPN.\nThe risk for remote code execution and unauthenticated firmware installation can be mitigated by ensuring encryption and authentication between the user and the device, e.g., by VPN.\nUse a modern and up to date browser.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-305120\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
