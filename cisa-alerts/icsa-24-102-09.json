[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRockwell Automation 5015\\-AENFTXT (Update A)============================================ Last Revised April 25, 2024 Alert Code ICSA\\-24\\-102\\-09[**View CSAF**](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v4 8\\.7*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Rockwell Automation* **Equipment**  : 5015\\-AENFTXT* **Vulnerability**  : Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the device and impact availability for the affected system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Rockwell Automation ethernet/IP adapter products are affected:* 5015\\-AENFTXT: v2\\.011 to v2\\.012### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) An input validation vulnerability exists among the affected products that causes the secondary adapter to result in a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF) when malicious input is entered. If exploited, the availability of the device will be impacted, and a manual restart is required. Additionally, a malformed PTP packet is needed to exploit this vulnerability.[CVE\\-2024\\-2424](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-2424)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE\\-2024\\-2424](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-2424)  . A base score of 8\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is [CVSS:4\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  .### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation recommends updating to [v2\\.012](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/support/product/product-downloads.html)  Users using the affected software, who are not able to upgrade to one of the corrected versions, are encouraged to apply [Security Best Practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US#__highlight)  , where possible. For more information and to see Rockwell's detection rules, see Rockwell Automation's [security advisory.](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/company/about-us/sustainability/trust-security/security-advisories.html?sort=pubAsc)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
