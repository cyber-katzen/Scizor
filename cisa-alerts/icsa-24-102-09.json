EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: 5015-AENFTXT\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the device and impact availability for the affected system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Rockwell Automation ethernet/IP adapter products are affected:\n\n5015-AENFTXT: v2.011 to v2.012\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn input validation vulnerability exists among the affected products that causes the secondary adapter to result in a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF) when malicious input is entered. If exploited, the availability of the device will be impacted, and a manual restart is required. Additionally, a malformed PTP packet is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2024-2424 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-2424. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends updating to v2.012\nUsers using the affected software, who are not able to upgrade to one of the corrected versions, are encouraged to apply Security Best Practices, where possible.\nFor more information and to see Rockwell's detection rules, see Rockwell Automation's security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nApril 11, 2024: Initial Publication\nApril 25, 2024: Update A - Update to affected product versions and to mitigations\n\n",
