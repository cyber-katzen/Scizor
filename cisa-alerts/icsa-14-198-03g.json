Updates are available for APE 2.0.2, S7-1500, WinCC OA (PVSS), CP1543-1, Ruggedcom ROX 1, and ROX 2-based products.\n--------- End Update G Part 1 of 3 ----------\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target OpenSSL vulnerabilities are publicly available. ICS-CERT is unaware of any OpenSSL exploits that target Siemens\u2019 products specifically.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n--------- Begin Update G Part 2 of 3 --------\n\nAPE (only affected if SSL/TLS component is used):\n\n\nAPE stand-alone: All versions prior to V2.0.2,\nELAN on APE: All versions prior to V8.4.0,\n\n\nCP1543-1: prior to Version 1.1.25,\nROX 1: all versions prior to V1.16.1 (only affected if Crossbow is installed),\nROX 2: all versions prior to V2.6.0 (only affected if ELAN or Crossbow is installed),\n\n\nCrossbow: All versions prior to V4.2.3\nELAN: All versions prior to V8.4.0\n\n\nS7-1500: versions prior to Version 1.6, and\nWinCC OA (PVSS): Version 3.12-P001\u20133.12-P008\n\n--------- End Update G Part 2 of 3 ----------\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerabilities identified could impact authenticity, integrity, and availability of affected devices. The man-in-the-middle attack could allow an attacker to hijack a session between an authorized user and the device. The other vulnerabilities reported could impact the availability of the device by causing the web server of the product to crash.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, healthcare and public health sectors, and transportation systems.\nThe affected Siemens industrial products are for process and network control and monitoring in critical infrastructure sectors such as Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMAN-IN-THE-MIDDLECWE-310: Cryptographic Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html, web site last accessed July 17, 2014.\n\nAn attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack between a vulnerable client and a vulnerable server.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed July 17, 2014. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed July 17, 2014. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
