[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens OpenSSL Vulnerabilities (Update G)========================================== Last Revised August 29, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-198\\-03GOVERVIEW-------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the updated advisory titled ICSA\\-14\\-198\\-03F Siemens OpenSSL Vulnerabilities that was published October 16, 2014, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update G Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Siemens has identified four vulnerabilities in its OpenSSL cryptographic software library affecting several Siemens industrial products. Updates are available for APE 2\\.0\\.2, S7\\-1500, WinCC OA (PVSS), CP1543\\-1, Ruggedcom ROX 1, and ROX 2\\-based products.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update G Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target OpenSSL vulnerabilities are publicly available. ICS\\-CERT is unaware of any OpenSSL exploits that target Siemens\u2019 products specifically.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Siemens products are affected:### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update G Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-*** APE (only affected if SSL/TLS component is used):* APE stand\\-alone: All versions prior to V2\\.0\\.2,* ELAN on APE: All versions prior to V8\\.4\\.0,* CP1543\\-1: prior to Version 1\\.1\\.25,* ROX 1: all versions prior to V1\\.16\\.1 (only affected if Crossbow is installed),* ROX 2: all versions prior to V2\\.6\\.0 (only affected if ELAN or Crossbow is installed),* Crossbow: All versions prior to V4\\.2\\.3* ELAN: All versions prior to V8\\.4\\.0* S7\\-1500: versions prior to Version 1\\.6, and* WinCC OA (PVSS): Version 3\\.12\\-P001\u20133\\.12\\-P008### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update G Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**IMPACT------ The vulnerabilities identified could impact authenticity, integrity, and availability of affected devices. The man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack could allow an attacker to hijack a session between an authorized user and the device. The other vulnerabilities reported could impact the availability of the device by causing the web server of the product to crash. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, healthcare and public health sectors, and transportation systems.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.2.
