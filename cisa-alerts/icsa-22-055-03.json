MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Schneider Electric recommends users using Easergy P5 upgrade to v01\\.402\\.101 and users using Easergy P3 upgrade to version 30\\.205\\. These firmware upgrades include a fix for the identified vulnerabilities and are available upon request from Schneider Electric\u2019s [Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 4 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For CVE\\-2022\\-22723 and CVE\\-2022\\-22725 only, if users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigation to reduce the risk of exploit:* Disable the GOOSE service of the product to reduce the risk of exposure. If GOOSE is needed for the application, use it only in a secure local area network. For more information see Schneider Electric\u2019s security notifications: [SEVD\\-2022\\-011\\-03](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2022-011-03)  , [SEVD\\-2022\\-011\\-04](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2022-011-04)  Schneider Electric recommends users use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric recommends the use of backups and an evaluation of the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric\u2019s [Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp)  for assistance removing a patch. Schneider Electric recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* Never connect programming software to any network other than a network intended to for the devices.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
