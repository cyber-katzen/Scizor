[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity Advisory\\#StopRansomware: Play Ransomware================================= Release Date December 18, 2023 Alert Code AA23\\-352A Related topics: , [Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware](/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/malware-phishing-and-ransomware) #### Actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from Play ransomware:1. Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.2. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, VPN, and accounts that access critical systems.3. Regularly patch and update software and applications to their latest versions and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.### **SUMMARY*****Note:**  This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* [*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.*  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate the Play ransomware group\u2019s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as October 2023\\. Since June 2022, the Play (also known as Playcrypt) ransomware group has impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. As of October 2023, the FBI was aware of approximately 300 affected entities allegedly exploited by the ransomware actors. In Australia, the first Play ransomware incident was observed in April 2023, and most recently in November 2023\\. The Play ransomware group is presumed to be a closed group, designed to \u201cguarantee the secrecy of deals,\u201d according to a statement on the group\u2019s data leak website. Play ransomware actors employ a double\\-extortion model, encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. Ransom notes do not include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions, rather, victims are instructed to contact the threat actors via email. The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. This includes requiring multifactor authentication, maintaining offline backups of data, implementing a recovery plan, and keeping all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.

See the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise section for all referenced tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\")  and CISA\u2019s [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\")  .#### **Initial Access** The Play ransomware group gains initial access to victim networks through the abuse of valid accounts \\[ [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\")  ] and exploitation of public\\-facing applications \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\")  ], specifically through known FortiOS ( [CVE\\-2018\\-13379](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379 \"CVE-2018-13379\")  and [CVE\\-2020\\-12812](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12812 \"CVE-2020-12812\")  ) and Microsoft Exchange (ProxyNotShell \\[ [CVE\\-2022\\-41040](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41040 \"CVE-2022-41040\")  and [CVE\\-2022\\-41082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41082 \"CVE-2022-41082\")  ]) vulnerabilities. Play ransomware actors have been observed to use external\\-facing services \\[ [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\")  ] such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for initial access.#### **Discovery and Defense Evasion** Play ransomware actors use tools like [AdFind](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0552/ \"AdFind\")  to run Active Directory queries \\[ [TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/ \"Discovery\")  ] and Grixba \\[ [1](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/play-ransomware-volume-shadow-copy \"Play Ransomware Group Using New Custom Data-Gathering Tools\")  ], an information\\-stealer, to enumerate network information \\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ] and scan for anti\\-virus software \\[ [T1518\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1518/001/ \"Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery\")  ]. Actors also use tools like GMER, IOBit, and PowerTool to disable anti\\-virus software \\[ [T1562\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1562/001/ \"Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\")  ] and remove log files \\[ [T1070\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\")  ]. In some instances, cybersecurity researchers have observed Play ransomware actors using [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\")  scripts to target Microsoft Defender.\\[ [2](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-play \"Ransomware Spotlight | Play\")  ]#### **Lateral Movement and Execution** Play ransomware actors use command and control (C2\\) applications, including [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\")  and SystemBC, and tools like [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0029/ \"PsExec\")  , to assist with lateral movement and file execution. Once established on a network, the ransomware actors search for unsecured credentials \\[ [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/ \"Unsecured Credentials\")  ] and use the [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0002/ \"Mimikatz\")  credential dumper to gain domain administrator access \\[ [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/ \"OS Credential Dumping\")  ]. According to open source reporting \\[ [2](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-play \"Ransomware Spotlight | Play\")  ], to further enumerate vulnerabilities, Play ransomware actors use Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts (WinPEAS) \\[ [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\")  ] to search for additional [privilege escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0004/ \"Privilege Escalation\")  paths. Actors then distribute executables \\[ [T1570](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1570/ \"Lateral Tool Transfer\")  ] via Group Policy Objects \\[ [T1484\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1484/001/ \"Domain Policy Modification: Group Policy Modification\")  ].#### **Exfiltration and Encryption** Play ransomware actors often split compromised data into segments and use tools like WinRAR to compress files \\[ [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/001/ \"Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\")  ] into `.RAR`  format for exfiltration. The actors then use WinSCP to transfer data \\[ [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1048/ \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\")  ] from a compromised network to actor\\-controlled accounts. Following exfiltration, files are encrypted \\[ [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\")  ] with AES\\-RSA hybrid encryption using intermittent encryption, encrypting every other file portion of 0x100000 bytes. \\[ [3](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/crimeware-trends-ransomware-developers-turn-to-intermittent-encryption-to-evade-detection/ \"Crimeware Trends | Ransomware Developers Turn to Intermittent Encryption to Evade Detection\")  ] ( **Note:**  System files are skipped during the encryption process.) A `.play`  extension is added to file names and a ransom note titled `ReadMe[.]txt`  is placed in file directory `C:`  .#### **Impact** The Play ransomware group uses a double\\-extortion model \\[ [T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/ \"Financial Theft\")  ], encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. The ransom note directs victims to contact the Play ransomware group at an email address ending in `@gmx[.]de`  . Ransom payments are paid in cryptocurrency to wallet addresses provided by Play actors. If a victim refuses to pay the ransom demand, the ransomware actors threaten to publish exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network ( `[.]onion`  URL).#### **Leveraged Tools** Table 1 lists legitimate tools Play ransomware actors have repurposed for their operations. The legitimate tools listed in this product are all publicly available.

**MITIGATIONS** These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC recommend that software manufacturers incorporate secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles and tactics into their software development practices to limit the impact of ransomware techniques (such as threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities into remote software systems), thus, strengthening the security posture for their customers. For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s [Secure by Design and Default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\")  webpage and [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\")  . The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC recommend organizations apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Play ransomware. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.* **Implement a recovery plan**  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers \\[ [CPG 2\\.F, 2\\.R, 2\\.S](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ] in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).* **Require all accounts**  with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) **to comply**  with NIST\u2019s [standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ \"Digital Identity Guidelines\")  for developing and managing password policies \\[ [CPG 2\\.C](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].\t+ Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length \\[\t [CPG 2\\.B](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \t ];\t+ Store passwords in hashed format using industry\\-recognized password managers;\t+ Add password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials;\t+ Avoid reusing passwords;\t+ Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts \\[\t [CPG 2\\.G](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \t ];\t+ Disable password \u201chints\u201d;\t+ Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\t**Note:** \t NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\t+ Require administrator credentials to install software.* **Require multifactor authentication**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ] for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems. Also see [Protect Yourself: Multi\\-Factor Authentication \\| Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/resources-protect-yourself/personal-security-guides/protect-yourself-multi-factor-authentication \"Protect Yourself: Multi-Factor Authentication\")  .* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.**  Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")  in internet\\-facing systems \\[ [CPG 1\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ]. Organizations are advised to deploy the latest Microsoft Exchange security updates. If unable to patch, then disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) until updates are able to be undertaken. Also see [Patching Applications and Operating Systems \\| Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-administration/patching-applications-and-operating-systems \"Patching Applications and Operating Systems\")  .* **Segment networks**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.F](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Also see [Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/network-hardening/implementing-network-segmentation-and-segregation \"Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation\")  .* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware**  with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network \\[ [CPG 1\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ]. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.* **Filter network traffic**  by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services on internal systems. This prevents actors from directly connecting to remote access services they have established for persistence. Also see [Inbound Traffic Filtering \u2013 Technique D3\\-ITF](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficFiltering/ \"Network Traffic Filtering\")  .* **Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software**  on all hosts.* **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories**  for new and/or unrecognized accounts \\[ [CPG 1\\.A, 2\\.O](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].* **Audit user accounts**  with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege \\[ [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].* **Disable unused** **ports**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.V](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].* **Consider adding an email banner to emails**  \\[ [CPG 2\\.M](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ] received from outside your organization.* **Disable hyperlinks**  in received emails.* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.**  For example, the just\\-in\\-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the [Zero Trust model](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model \"Zero Trust Maturity Model\")  ). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.* **Disable command\\-line and scripting activities and permissions.**  Privileged escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally \\[ [CPG 2\\.E](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].* **Maintain offline backups of data**  and regularly maintain backup and restoration \\[ [CPG 2\\.R](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ]. By instituting this practice, an organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.* **Ensure backup data is encrypted, immutable**  (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[ [CPG 2\\.K](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\")  ].### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 3\\-11\\).2. Align your security technologies against this technique.3. Test your technologies against this technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC recommend continually testing your security program at scale and in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.### **RESOURCES*** [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.stopransomware.gov/ \"#StopRansomware\")  is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.* Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: [\\#StopRansomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\")  .* No\\-cost cyber hygiene services: [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"Cyber Hygiene Services\")  and [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"Ransomware Readiness Assessment CSET v10.3\")  .### **REPORTING** The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Play ransomware actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI, CISA, and ASD\u2019s ACSC do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a [local FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\")  , the FBI\u2019s [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\\)](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\")  , or CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center ( [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov?subject=Ransomware%20Incident \"Report to CISA\")  or 888\\-282\\-0870\\). Australian organizations that have been impacted or require assistance in regard to a ransomware incident can contact ASD's ACSC via 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371\\), or by submitting a report to [cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ \"Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre\")  .### **DISCLAIMER** The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
