EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: mySCADA\nEquipment: myPRO\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the affected device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following mySCADA products are affected:\n\nmyPRO: Versions prior to 8.31.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nThe affected application uses a hard-coded password which could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the affected device.\nCVE-2024-4708 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-4708. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Czech Republic\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNassim Asrir working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nmySCADA recommends updating myPRO to v8.31.0.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
