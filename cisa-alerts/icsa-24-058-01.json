A remote attacker could cause a temporary denial-of-service (DoS) condition for a certain period of time in the product's Ethernet communication by performing a TCP SYN Flood attack.\nCVE-2023-7033\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMitsubishi Electric Corporation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends that users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:\n\nUse a firewall, virtual private network (VPN) etc., to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.\nUse within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.\nUse IP filter function to block access from untrusted hosts. For details on the IP filter function, please refer to the following manual for each product:\"13.1 IP Filter Function\" in the MELSEC iQ-F FX5 User's Manual (Communication).\nRestrict physical access to the affected products and the LAN to which they are connected.\n\nFor specific update instructions and additional details refer to\u00a0Mitsubishi Electric advisory 2023-023\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
