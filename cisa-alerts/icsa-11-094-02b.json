This is a Web browser\u2011based human\\-machine interface (HMI) product. This RPC vulnerability affects the WebAccess Network Service on Port\u00a04592/TCP and allows remote code execution.\n \n\n\n\n Advantech has provided a free version upgrade that mitigates this vulnerability for any licensed user of any previous version of WebAccess.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 2 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n This vulnerability affects all versions of WebAccess prior to Version 7\\.1 2013\\.05\\.30, including all legacy versions of either Advantech WebAccess or BroadWin WebAccess.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 2 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n The successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\n \n\n\n\n The full impact to individual organizations is dependent on multiple factors unique to each organization. The NCCIC/ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and operational product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update B Part 3 of 5 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess is a Web\\-based HMI product used in energy, manufacturing, and building automation systems.
