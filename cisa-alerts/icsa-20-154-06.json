EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: SWARCO TRAFFIC SYSTEMS\nEquipment: CPU LS4000\nVulnerability: Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow access to the device and disturb operations with connected devices.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nCERT VDE reports the vulnerability affects the following traffic light controller:\n\nCPU LS4000: All OS versions starting with G4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nAn open port used for debugging grants root access to the device without access control via network.\nCVE-2020-12493 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMartin Aman (ProtectEM) reported this vulnerability in coordination with CERT@VDE\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSWARCO TRAFFIC SYSTEMS released a patch to fix the vulnerability and close the port. Please contact SWARCO TRAFFIC SYSTEMS for further information.\nCERT@VDE published VDE-2020-016 regarding this vulnerability.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
