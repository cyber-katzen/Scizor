EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/high attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Mitsubishi Electric* **Equipment:**  GX Works2* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition in GX Works2\\.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of GX Works2, an engineering software suite, are affected:* GX Works2: Versions 1\\.606G and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER HANDLING OF LENGTH PARAMETER INCONSISTENCY CWE\\-130](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html) If an attacker tampers with a program file in a Mitsubishi Electric PLC by sending malicious crafted packets to the PLC, reading the program file into GX Works2, the engineering software incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data, which could result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition in the software.[CVE\\-2021\\-20608](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20608)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Mitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends users download and update the latest version of each software product:* [GX Works2, version 1\\.610L or later](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/#software) Mitsubishi Electric has included the following directions for updates:* Unzip the downloaded file (zip format).* Run \"setup.exe\" in the extracted folder to install. For users of software for which the fixed version has not been released, or those who are not able to immediately update the software, Mitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigations to minimize risk:* Restrict the connection of all control system devices and systems to the network so \u00a0they can only be accessed from trusted networks and hosts.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Use virtual private network (VPN) when remote access to Mitsubishi Electric PLC is required.
