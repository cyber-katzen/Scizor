RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Softing reports these vulnerabilities affect the following products:\n \n\n\n* Secure Integration Server: Version 1\\.22 and prior\n* edgeConnector: Version 3\\.1\n* edgeAggregator: Version 3\\.1\n* OPC UA C\\+\\+ Server SDK: Version 6\n* OPC Suite: Version 5\\.2\n* uaGate: Version 1\\.74\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.1\n [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)\n\n\n\n A crafted HTTP packet with a large content\\-length header can create a denial\\-of\\-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1069](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1069) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.2\n [UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE\\-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)\n\n\n\n The application searches for a library dll that is not found. If an attacker can place a dll with this name, then the attacker can leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the targeted Softing Secure Integration Server.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-2334](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2334) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.3\n [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)\n\n\n\n Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships with the default administrator credentials as \\`admin\\` and password as \\`admin\\`. This allows Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the \\`admin\\` password. There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change the password, many steps are required.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-2336](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2336) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n#### 3\\.2\\.4\n [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE\\-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)\n\n\n\n The \u201crestore configuration\u201d feature of Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code. Using the \"restore configuration\" feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file may cause a file to be created and executed upon touching the disk.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1373](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1373) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Softing released new versions to address these vulnerabilities and notified known users of the releases. Users are advised to update to the new versions:\n \n\n\n* Softing Secure Integration Server V1\\.30\n\n\n\n The latest software packages can be downloaded from the\n [Softing website](https://industrial.softing.com/products/opc-ua-sdks.html) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Softing recommends the following mitigations and workarounds:\n \n\n\n* Change the admin password or create a new user with administrative rights and delete the default admin user.\n* Configure the Windows firewall to block network requests to IP port 9000\\.\n* Disable the HTTP Server in NGINX configuration of the Softing Secure Integration Server, only using the HTTPS server.\n\n\n\n For more details on these vulnerabilities and mitigations, users should see\n [SYT\\-2022\\-7](https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-7.html) \n ,\n [SYT\\-2022\\-6](https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-6.html) \n ,\n [SYT\\-2022\\-5](https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-5.html) \n , and\n [SYT\\-2022\\-4](https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-4.html) \n on the\n [Softing security website](https://industrial.softing.com/support/security-information.html) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Softing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-22-228-04) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2022-2337", "CVE-2022-2338", "CVE-2022-1748", "CVE-2022-2336", "CVE-2022-2335", "CVE-2022-2334", "CVE-2022-1069", "CVE-2022-1373", "CVE-2022-2547"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-22-228-04", "title": "Softing Secure Integration Server | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "9567bd2c3dde8718738e1e6cb30c6aa487c4351f50462112ba52a5ef3f97dc53"}
