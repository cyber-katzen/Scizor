EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Softing\nEquipment: Secure Integration Server\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, Uncontrolled Search Path Element, Improper Authentication, Relative Path Traversal, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, NULL Pointer Dereference, Integer Underflow.\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSofting reports these vulnerabilities affect the following products:\u00a0\n\nSecure Integration Server: Version 1.22 and prior\nedgeConnector: Version 3.1\nedgeAggregator: Version 3.1\nOPC UA C++ Server SDK: Version 6\nOPC Suite: Version 5.2\nuaGate: Version 1.74\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA crafted HTTP packet with a large content-length header can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.\nCVE-2022-1069 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nThe application searches for a library dll that is not found. If an attacker can place a dll with this name, then the attacker can leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the targeted Softing Secure Integration Server.\nCVE-2022-2334 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nSofting Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships with the default administrator credentials as `admin` and password as `admin`. This allows Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the `admin` password. There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change the password, many steps are required.\nCVE-2022-2336 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nThe \u201crestore configuration\u201d feature of Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code. Using the \"restore configuration\" feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file may cause a file to be created and executed upon touching the disk.\nCVE-2022-1373 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nSofting Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to authentication bypass via a machine-in-the-middle attack. The default the administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP protocol, facilitating the attack. The HTTP request may contain the session cookie in the request, which may be captured for use in authenticating to the server.\nCVE-2022-2338 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nSofting OPC UA C++ Server SDK, Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, edgeAggregator, OPC Suite, and uaGate are affected by a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.\nCVE-2022-1748 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nA crafted HTTP packet with a missing HTTP URI can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.\nCVE-2022-2337 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nA crafted HTTP packet without a content-type header can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.\nCVE-2022-2547 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER UNDERFLOW (WRAP OR WRAPAROUND) CWE-191\nA crafted HTTP packet with a -1 content-length header can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.\nCVE-2022-2335 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to Softing and CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSofting released new versions to address these vulnerabilities and notified known users of the releases. Users are advised to update to the new versions:\n\nSofting Secure Integration Server V1.30\u00a0\n\nThe latest software packages can be downloaded from the Softing website.\u00a0\nSofting recommends the following mitigations and workarounds:\u00a0\n\nChange the admin password or create a new user with administrative rights and delete the default admin user.\u00a0\nConfigure the Windows firewall to block network requests to IP port 9000.\u00a0\nDisable the HTTP Server in NGINX configuration of the Softing Secure Integration Server, only using the HTTPS server.\u00a0\n\nFor more details on these vulnerabilities and mitigations, users should see SYT-2022-7, SYT-2022-6, SYT-2022-5, and SYT-2022-4 on the Softing security website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n",
