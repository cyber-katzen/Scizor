RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PLC Editor ladder logic software are affected:\n\nPLC Editor: Versions 1.3.8 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-42705 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-42707 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: China\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson), working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWECON has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of these affected products are invited to contact WECON technical support for additional information.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
