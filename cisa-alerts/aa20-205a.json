See the ATT&CK for Enterprise\u00a0and\u00a0ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems frameworks for all referenced threat actor techniques and mitigations.\nOver recent months, cyber actors have demonstrated their continued willingness to conduct malicious cyber activity against critical infrastructure (CI) by exploiting internet-accessible operational technology (OT) assets.[1] Due to the increase in adversary capabilities and activity, the criticality to U.S. national security and way of life, and the vulnerability of OT systems, civilian infrastructure makes attractive targets for foreign powers attempting to do harm to U.S. interests or retaliate for perceived U.S. aggression. OT assets are critical to the Department of Defense (DoD) mission and underpin essential National Security Systems (NSS) and services, as well as the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and other critical infrastructure. At this time of heightened tensions, it is critical that asset owners and operators of critical infrastructure take the following immediate steps to ensure resilience and safety of U.S. systems should a time of crisis emerge in the near term. The National Security Agency (NSA)\u00a0along with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommend that all DoD, NSS, DIB, and U.S. critical infrastructure facilities take immediate actions to secure their OT assets.\nInternet-accessible OT assets are becoming more prevalent across the 16 U.S. CI sectors as companies increase remote operations and monitoring, accommodate a decentralized workforce, and expand outsourcing of key skill areas such as instrumentation and control, OT asset management/maintenance, and in some cases, process operations and maintenance. Legacy OT assets that were not designed to defend against malicious cyber activities, combined with readily available information that identifies OT assets connected via the internet (e.g., Shodan,[2] Kamerka [3]), are creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of 1) easy access to unsecured assets, 2) use of common, open-source information about devices, and 3) an extensive list of exploits deployable via common exploit frameworks [4] (e.g., Metasploit,[5] Core Impact,[6] and Immunity Canvas [7]). Observed cyber threat activities can be mapped to the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) for Industrial Controls Systems (ICS) framework.[8] It is important to note that while the behavior may not be technically advanced, it is still a serious threat because the potential impact to critical assets is so high.\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nRecently Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nSpearphishing [T1192] to obtain initial access to the organization\u2019s information technology (IT) network before pivoting to the OT network.\nDeployment of commodity ransomware to Encrypt Data for Impact [T1486] on both networks.\nConnecting to Internet Accessible PLCs [T883] requiring no authentication for initial access.\nUtilizing Commonly Used Ports [T885] and Standard Application Layer Protocols [T869], to communicate with controllers and download modified control logic.\nUse of vendor engineering software and Program Downloads [T843].\nModifying Control Logic [T833] and Parameters [T836] on PLCs.\n\nImpacts\n\nImpacting a Loss of Availability [T826] on the OT network.\nPartial Loss of View [T829] for human operators.\nResulting in Loss of Productivity and Revenue [T828].\nAdversary Manipulation of Control [T831] and disruption to physical processes.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nMitigations\n\nHave a Resilience Plan for OT\nSince the Ukraine cyberattack of 2015 organizations must assume in their planning of not only a malfunctioning or inoperative control system, but a control system that is actively acting contrary to the safe and reliable operation of the process. Organizations need an OT resilience plan that allows them to:\n\nImmediately disconnect systems from the Internet that do not need internet connectivity for safe and reliable operations. Ensure that compensating controls are in place where connectivity cannot be removed.\nPlan for continued manual process operations should the ICS become unavailable or need to be deactivated due to hostile takeover.\nRemove additional functionality that could induce risk and attack surface area.\nIdentify system and operational dependencies.\nRestore OT devices and services in a timely manner. Assign roles and responsibilities for OT network and device restoration.\nBackup \u201cgold copy\u201d resources, such as firmware, software, ladder logic, service contracts, product licenses, product keys, and configuration information. Verify that all \u201cgold copy\u201d resources are stored off-network and store at least one copy in a locked tamperproof environment (e.g., locked safe).\nTest and validate data backups and processes in the event of data loss due to malicious cyber activity.\n\nExercise your Incident Response Plan\nIn a state of heightened tensions and additional risk and exposure, it is critical to have a well-exercised incident response plan that is developed before an incident.\n\nConduct a tabletop exercise, including executive personnel, to test your existing incident response plan.\nBe sure to include your public affairs and legal teams in your exercise in addition to your IT, OT, and executive management.\nDiscuss key decisions points in the response plan and identify who has the authority to make key decisions under what circumstances.\nEnsure your plan takes into account a scenario inclusive of the TTPs above and where the control system is actively operating counter to safe and reliable operations.\nPartner with third parties for support. Review service contracts and government services for emergency incident response and recovery support.\n\nHarden Your Network\n\nRemote connectivity to OT networks and devices provides a known path that can be exploited by cyber actors. External exposure should be reduced as much as possible.\nRemove access from networks, such as non-U.S. IP addresses, if applicable, that do not have legitimate business reasons to communicate with the system.\nUse publicly available tools, such as Shodan, to discover internet-accessible OT devices. Take corrective actions to eliminate or mitigate internet-accessible connections immediately. Best practices include:\n\nFully patch all Internet-accessible systems.\nSegment networks to protect PLCs and workstations from direct exposure to the internet. Implement secure network architectures utilizing demilitarized zones (DMZs), firewalls, jump servers, and/or one-way communication diodes.\nEnsure all communications to remote devices use a virtual private network (VPN) with strong encryption further secured with multifactor authentication.\nCheck and validate the legitimate business need for such access.\nFilter network traffic to only allow IP addresses that are known to need access, and use geo-blocking where appropriate.\nConnect remote PLCs and workstations to network intrusion detection systems where feasible.\nCapture and review access logs from these systems.\nEncrypt network traffic preferably using NIAP-validated VPN products and/or CNSSP- or NIST-approved algorithms when supported by OT system components to prevent sniffing and man-in-the-middle tactics.
