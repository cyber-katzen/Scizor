EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Autodesk* **Equipment:**  FBX SDK* **Vulnerability:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Read, Use After Free, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to code execution or a denial\\-of\\-service condition. Products using Autodesk FBX SDK software are affected by these vulnerabilities.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of the affected products are affected:* Autodesk FBX SDK versions 2020 and prior* Luxion KeyShot version 11\\.3 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)** An out\\-of\\-bounds read vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020 could result in code execution or information disclosure through maliciously crafted FBX files. This vulnerability, if exploited alongside other vulnerabilities, could also result in code execution in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-41302](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41302)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [USE AFTER FREE CWE\\-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)** Once opened, a maliciously crafted FBX file could leverage a use\\-after\\-free vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020\\. Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the application to reference a memory location controlled by an unauthorized third party and run arbitrary code on the system.[CVE\\-2022\\-41303](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41303)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** An out\\-of\\-bounds write vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020 could result in code execution or information disclosure through maliciously crafted FBX files.[CVE\\-2022\\-41304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-41304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael DePlante of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Luxion recommends users using KeyShot 11\\.3 and prior versions to update to [KeyShot 2023\\.1](https://www.keyshot.com/csirt/)  . Autodesk recommends users of the affected products apply the available hotfix for their version via the Autodesk Desktop App.* [FBX SDK 2020\\.3\\.2](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-3) For more information, see the Autodesk [Security Advisory](https://www.autodesk.com/trust/security-advisories/adsk-sa-2022-0022)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
