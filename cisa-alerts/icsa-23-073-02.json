EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Autodesk\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0FBX SDK\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Out-of-bounds Read, Use After Free, Out-of-bounds Write\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to code execution or a denial-of-service condition. Products using Autodesk FBX SDK software are affected by these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of the affected products are affected:\u00a0\n\nAutodesk FBX SDK versions 2020 and prior\u00a0\nLuxion KeyShot version 11.3 and prior\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020 could result in code execution or information disclosure through maliciously crafted FBX files. This vulnerability, if exploited alongside other vulnerabilities, could also result in code execution in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41302\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\u00a0\nOnce opened, a maliciously crafted FBX file could leverage a use-after-free vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020. Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the application to reference a memory location controlled by an unauthorized third party and run arbitrary code on the system.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41303\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability in versions of Autodesk FBX SDK prior to version 2020 could result in code execution or information disclosure through maliciously crafted FBX files.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-41304\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States \u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael DePlante of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nLuxion recommends users using KeyShot 11.3 and prior versions to update to\u00a0KeyShot 2023.1. \u00a0\nAutodesk recommends users of the affected products apply the available hotfix for their version via the Autodesk Desktop App.\u00a0\n\nFBX SDK 2020.3.2\u00a0\n\nFor more information, see the Autodesk\u00a0Security Advisory.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
