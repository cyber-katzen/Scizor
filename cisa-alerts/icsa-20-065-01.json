RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to change settings, delete the application, run remote code, cause a system crash, cause a denial-of-service condition, revert to factory settings, and overwrite MAC addresses.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of I/O-CHECK software are affected by the listed vulnerabilities:\n\nSeries PFC100 (750-81xx/xxx-xxx)\nSeries PFC200 (750-82xx/xxx-xxx)\n750-852, 750-831/xxx-xxx, 750-881, 750-880/xxx-xxx, 750-889\n750-823, 750-832/xxx-xxx, 750-862, 750-890/xxx-xxx, 750-891\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH SENT DATA CWE-201\nA specially crafted packet could cause the server to send back packets containing data from the stack.\nCVE-2019-5073 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER ACCESS WITH INCORRECT LENGTH VALUE CWE-805\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition due to the lack of input validation, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-5074 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER ACCESS WITH INCORRECT LENGTH VALUE CWE-805\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition due to the lack of input validation, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-5075 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAn attacker can send an unauthenticated packet that will overwrite the MAC address stored persistently on the device. This can cause the device to enter an error state where it ceases all network communications.\nCVE-2019-5077 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAn attacker can send an unauthenticated packet that will erase system data on the device. This may cause the device to enter an error state where it ceases all network communications.\nCVE-2019-5078 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition due to the lack of input validation, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-5079 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAn attacker can send unauthenticated packets that will cause the device to restore factory settings. This may cause the device to enter an error state where it ceases all network communications.\nCVE-2019-5080 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nLack of input validation may allow an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow condition by sending unauthenticated packets to the device, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-5081 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected products are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition due to the lack of input validation, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-5082 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Manufacturing, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKelly Leuschner of Cisco Talos coordinated these vulnerabilities with CERT@VDE.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nWAGO recommends updating to the latest firmware, FW 15 or above.\nWAGO has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nThe I/O-Check service protocol is only needed during installation and commissioning, not during normal operations.\nIt is highly recommended to disable IP Port 6626 after commissioning.\nDisable unused TCP/UDP-ports.\nRestrict network access to the device.\nDo not directly connect the device to the Internet.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
