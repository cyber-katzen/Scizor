EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix Studio Pro 7, 8, 9, 10.\nVulnerability: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of a victim user's system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nMendix Studio Pro 7: Versions prior to V7.23.37\nMendix Studio Pro 8: Versions prior to V8.18.27\nMendix Studio Pro 9: Versions prior to V9.24.0\nMendix Studio Pro 10: Versions prior to V10.3.1\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the integrated libwebp library, that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted image files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of a victim user's system. As a precondition, the user needs to add such image files, or Mendix Marketplace content that contains such image files, to their project. The exploitation happens in certain scenarios when the user opens the document that contains the image.\nCVE-2023-4863\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nMendix Studio Pro 7: Update to V7.23.37 or\u00a0later version\nMendix Studio Pro 8: Update to V8.18.27 or\u00a0later version\nMendix Studio Pro 9: Update to V9.24.0 or\u00a0later version\nMendix Studio Pro 10: Update to V10.3.1 or\u00a0later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-268517 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nNovember 16, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
