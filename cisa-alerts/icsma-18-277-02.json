EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 4.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable on an adjacent network/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Change Healthcare\nEquipment: PeerVue Web Server\nVulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain technical information about the PeerVue Web Server, allowing an attacker to target a system for attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nChange Healthcare reports the vulnerability affects the following product:\n\nPeerVue Web Server all versions up to 7.6.2\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH AN ERROR MESSAGE CWE-209\nThis vulnerability results from improper error handling in HTTP-based communications with the server, which could allow an attacker to obtain technical information.\nCVE-2018-10624 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDan Regalado of Zingbox reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change Healthcare has been very responsive and aggressive in their efforts to mitigate the issue and released a patch to remediate the reported vulnerability. Users should contact the Change Healthcare Support\u00a0team for information regarding the patch.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability, but information regarding this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.\n",
