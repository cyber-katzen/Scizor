**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. The Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security can be found at:[https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:[https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/topic\\-areas/future\\-of\\-manufacturing/industrial\\-security.html](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/topic-areas/future-of-manufacturing/industrial-security.html)  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* The attacker must have network access for CVE\\-2017\\-5712 and local access for all other vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends operating the devices only within trusted networks. For more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security notification SSA\\-892715 on their website:[https://cert\\-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa\\-892715\\.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-892715.pdf)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, NCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
