In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. The Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:\u00a0\nhttps://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/topic-areas/future-of-manufacturing/industrial-security.html\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nThe attacker must have network access for CVE-2017-5712 and local access for all other vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends operating the devices only within trusted networks.\n\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security notification SSA-892715 on their website:\nhttps://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-892715.pdf\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, NCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
