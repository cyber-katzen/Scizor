EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Climatix\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting, Basic XSS\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-105-04 Siemens Climatix that was published April 14th, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code to access confidential information without authentication.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of the Climatix product line are affected:\n\nClimatix POL908 (BACnet/IP module); all versions\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nClimatix POL909 (AWM module); all versions\u00a0prior to v11.32\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of other users\u2019 web sessions.\nCVE-2020-7574 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SCRIPT-RELATED HTML TAGS IN A WEB PAGE (\u2018BASIC XSS\u2019) CWE-80\nThe affected product could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of other users\u2019 web sessions.\nCVE-2020-7575 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nEzequiel Fernandez from Dreamlab Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUpdate Climatix POL908 and POL909 to v11.22 or later. This update does not solve the XSS issues, but disables the web interface by default, as it is no longer needed in standard use cases.\nClimatix POL908 is designed to be operated in protected BACnet/IP networks only. Do not connect it to other networks, such as an Office LAN or the Internet. Also consider removing POL908, as the integrated BACnet/IP implementation in newer versions of Climatix 600 controllers is already sufficient for your environment.\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nUpdate Climatix POL909 (AWM module): to v11.32\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nThe following mitigation measures apply only if the web interface is activated (e.g., via the Climatix SCOPE tool):\n\nClimatix POL909: When configuring your custom web application, disable the access to the default webpages provided by POL909.\nEnforce authentication for the web interface and change the default password of the standard ADMIN user.\nDisable JavaScript within the web browser used to access the web server of Climatix POL908.\nUtilize a modern web browser with integrated XSS filtering mechanisms.\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact Siemens ProductCERT.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-886514\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure\u00a0they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
