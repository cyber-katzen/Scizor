See the ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables mapped to the threat actors\u2019 activity.#### **Overview** Threat actors leveraging Rhysida ransomware are known to impact \u201ctargets of opportunity,\u201d including victims in the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors. Open source reporting details similarities between Vice Society (DEV\\-0832\\)\\[ [1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/25/dev-0832-vice-society-opportunistic-ransomware-campaigns-impacting-us-education-sector/ \"DEV-0832 (Vice Society) opportunistic ransomware campaigns impacting US education sector\")  ] activity and the actors observed deploying Rhysida ransomware. Additionally, open source reporting\\[ [2](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-rhysida \"Ransomware Roundup - Rhysida\")  ] has confirmed observed instances of Rhysida actors operating in a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) capacity, where ransomware tools and infrastructure are leased out in a profit\\-sharing model. Any ransoms paid are then split between the group and the affiliates. For additional information on Vice Society actors and associated activity, see the joint CSA [\\#StopRansomware: Vice Society](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-249a-0 \"#StopRansomware: Vice Society\")  .#### **Initial Access** Rhysida actors have been observed leveraging external\\-facing remote services to initially access and persist within a network. Remote services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. Rhysida actors have commonly been observed authenticating to internal VPN access points with compromised valid credentials \\[ [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\")  ], notably due to organizations lacking MFA enabled by default. Additionally, actors have been observed exploiting Zerologon ( [CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472 \"CVE-2020-1472 Detail\")  )\u2014a critical elevation of privileges vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Netlogon Remote Protocol \\[ [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\")  ]\u2014as well as conducting successful phishing attempts \\[ [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\")  ]. **Note:**  Microsoft released a patch for CVE\\-2020\\-1472 on August 11, 2020\\.\\[ [3](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472 \"Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\")  ]#### **Living off the Land** Analysis identified Rhysida actors using living off the land techniques, such as creating Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections for lateral movement \\[ [T1021\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/001/ \"Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\")  ], establishing VPN access, and utilizing PowerShell \\[ [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\")  ]. Living off the land techniques include using native (built into the operating system) network administration tools to perform operations. This allows the actors to evade detection by blending in with normal Windows systems and network activities.`Ipconfig`  \\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ], `whoami`  \\[ [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1033/ \"System Owner/User Discovery\")  ], `nltest`  \\[ [T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1482/ \"Domain Trust Discovery\")  ], and several `net`  commands have been used to enumerate victim environments and gather information about domains. In one instance of using compromised credentials, actors leveraged `net`  commands within PowerShell to identify logged\\-in users and performed reconnaissance on network accounts within the victim environment. **Note:**  The following commands were not performed in the exact order listed.* `net user [username] /domain`  \\[ [T1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1087/002/ \"Account Discovery: Domain Account\")  ]* `net group \u201cdomain computers\u201d /domain`  \\[ [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\")  ]* `net group \u201cdomain admins\u201d /domain`  \\[ [T1069\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/002/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Domain Groups\")  ]* `net localgroup administrators`  \\[ [T1069\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/001/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Local Groups\")  ] Analysis of the master file table (MFT)\\[ [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table \"Master File Table (Local File Systems)\")  ] identified the victim system generated the `ntuser.dat`  registry hive, which was created when the compromised user logged in to the system for the first time. This was considered anomalous due to the baseline of normal activity for that particular user and system. **Note:**  The [MFT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table \"Master File Table (Local File Systems)\")  resides within the New Technology File System (NTFS) and houses information about a file including its size, time and date stamps, permissions, and data content.#### **Leveraged Tools** Table 1 lists legitimate tools Rhysida actors have repurposed for their operations. The legitimate tools listed in this joint CSA are all publicly available. Use of these tools should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support they are used at the direction of or controlled by threat actors.**Disclaimer:**  Organizations are encouraged to investigate and vet use of these tools prior to performing remediation actions.*Table 1: Tools Leveraged by Rhysida Actors* | **Name** | **Description** || --- | --- || cmd.exe | The native command line prompt utility. || PowerShell.exe | A native command line tool used to start a Windows PowerShell session in a Command Prompt window. || PsExec.exe | A tool included in the PsTools suite used to execute processes remotely. Rhysida actors heavily leveraged this tool for lateral movement and remote execution. || mstsc.exe | A native tool that establishes an RDP connection to a host. || PuTTY.exe | Rhysida actors have been observed creating Secure Shell (SSH) PuTTy connections for lateral movement. In one example, analysis of PowerShell console host history for a compromised user account revealed Rhysida actors leveraged PuTTy to remotely connect to systems via SSH \\[  [T1021\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/004/ \"Remote Services: SSH\")   ]. || PortStarter | A back door script written in Go that provides functionality for modifying firewall settings and opening ports to pre\\-configured command and control (C2\\) servers.\\[  [1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/25/dev-0832-vice-society-opportunistic-ransomware-campaigns-impacting-us-education-sector/)   ] || secretsdump | A script used to extract credentials and other confidential information from a system. Rhysida actors have been observed using this for NTDS dumping \\[  [T1003\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/003/ \"OS Credential Dumping: NTDS\")   ] in various instances. || ntdsutil.exe | A standard Windows tool used to interact with the NTDS database. Rhysida actors used this tool to extract and dump the  `NTDS.dit`   database from the domain controller containing hashes for all Active Directory (AD) users.    **Note:**   It is strongly recommended that organizations conduct domain\\-wide password resets and double Kerberos TGT password resets if any indication is found that the  `NTDS.dit`   file was compromised. || AnyDesk | A common software that can be maliciously used by threat actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence \\[  [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\")   ]. AnyDesk also supports remote file transfer. || wevtutil.exe | A standard Windows Event Utility tool used to view event logs. Rhysida actors used this tool to clear a significant number of Windows event logs, including system, application, and security logs \\[  [T1070\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\")   ]. || PowerView | A PowerShell tool used to gain situational awareness of Windows domains. Review of PowerShell event logs identified Rhysida actors using this tool to conduct additional reconnaissance\\-based commands and harvest credentials. |#### **Rhysida Ransomware Characteristics**##### ***Execution*** In one investigation, Rhysida actors created two folders in the C:\\\\ drive labeled `in`  and `out`  , which served as a staging directory (central location) for hosting malicious executables. The `in`  folder contained file names in accordance with host names on the victim\u2019s network, likely imported through a scanning tool. The `out`  folder contained various files listed in Table 2 below. Rhysida actors deployed these tools and scripts to assist system and network\\-wide encryption.*Table 2: Malicious Executables Affiliated with Rhysida Infections* | **File Name** | **Hash (SHA256\\)** | **Description** || --- | --- | --- || conhost.exe | 6633fa85bb234a75927b23417313e51a4c155e12f71da3959e168851a600b010 | A ransomware binary. || psexec.exe | 078163d5c16f64caa5a14784323fd51451b8c831c73396b967b4e35e6879937b | A file used to execute a process on a remote or local host. || S\\_0\\.bat | 1c4978cd5d750a2985da9b58db137fc74d28422f1e087fd77642faa7efe7b597 | A batch script likely used to place  `1.ps1`   on victim systems for ransomware staging purposes \\[  [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/003/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\")   ]. || 1\\.ps1 | 4e34b9442f825a16d7f6557193426ae7a18899ed46d3b896f6e4357367276183 | Identifies an extension block list of files to encrypt and not encrypt. || S\\_1\\.bat | 97766464d0f2f91b82b557ac656ab82e15cae7896b1d8c98632ca53c15cf06c4 | A batch script that copies  `conhost.exe`   (the encryption binary) on an imported list of host names within the  `C:\\Windows\\Temp`   directory of each system. || S\\_2\\.bat | 918784e25bd24192ce4e999538be96898558660659e3c624a5f27857784cd7e1 | Executes  `conhost.exe`   on compromised victim systems, which encrypts and appends the extension of  `.Rhysida`   across the environment. | Rhysida ransomware uses a Windows 64\\-bit Portable Executable (PE) or common object file format (COFF) compiled using MinGW via the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which supports various programming languages such as C, C\\+\\+, and Go. The cryptographic ransomware application first injects the PE into running processes on the compromised system \\[ [T1055\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1055/002/ \"Process Injection: Portable Executable Injection\")  ]. Additionally, third\\-party researchers identified evidence of Rhysida actors developing custom tools with program names set to \u201cRhysida\\-0\\.1\u201d \\[ [T1587](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1587/ \"Develop Capabilities\")  ].##### ***Encryption*** After mapping the network, the ransomware encrypts data using a 4096\\-bit RSA encryption key with a ChaCha20 algorithm \\[ [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\")  ]. The algorithm features a 256\\-bit key, a 32\\-bit counter, and a 96\\-bit nonce along with a four\\-by\\-four matrix of 32\\-bit words in plain text. Registry modification commands \\[ [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1112/ \"Modify Registry\")  ] are not obfuscated, displayed as plain\\-text strings and executed via `cmd.exe`  . Rhysida\u2019s encryptor runs a file to encrypt and modify all encrypted files to display a `.rhysida`  extension.\\[ [5](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/rhysida/ \"What Is Rhysida Ransomware?\")  ] Following encryption, a PowerShell command deletes the binary \\[ [T1070\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/004/ \"Indicator Removal: File Deletion\")  ] from the network using a hidden command window \\[ [T1564\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1564/003/ \"Hide Artifacts: Hidden Window\")  ]. The Rhysida encryptor allows arguments `-d`  (select a directory) and `-sr`  (file deletion), defined by the authors of the code as parseOptions.\\[ [6](https://www.secplicity.org/2023/05/23/scratching-the-surface-of-rhysida-ransomware/ \"Scratching the Surface of Rhysida Ransomware\")  ] After the lines of binary strings complete their tasks, they delete themselves through the control panel to evade detection.##### *Data Extortion* Rhysida actors reportedly engage in \u201cdouble extortion\u201d \\[ [T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1657/ \"Financial Theft\")  ]\u2014demanding a ransom payment to decrypt victim data and threatening to publish the sensitive exfiltrated data unless the ransom is paid.\\[ [5](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/rhysida/ \"What Is Rhysida Ransomware?\")  ],\\[ [7](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/rhysida-ransomware/ \"What Cisco Talos knows about the Rhysida ransomware\")  ] Rhysida actors direct victims to send ransom payments in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses provided by the threat actors. As shown in Figure 1, Rhysida ransomware drops a ransom note named \u201cCriticalBreachDetected\u201d as a PDF file\u2014the note provides each company with a unique code and instructions to contact the group via a Tor\\-based portal.![Figure 1: Rhysida Ransom Note](/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2023-11/Figure%201%20-%20Rhysida%20Ransom%20Note.png?itok=JtyDjHnc)*Figure 1: Rhysida Ransom Note*  Identified in analysis and also listed in open source reporting, the contents of the ransom note are embedded as plain\\-text in the ransom binary, offering network defenders an opportunity to deploy string\\-based detection for alerting on evidence of the ransom note. Rhysida threat actors may target systems that do not use command\\-line operating systems. The format of the PDF ransom notes could indicate that Rhysida actors only target systems that are compatible with handling PDF documents.\\[ [8](https://socradar.io/threat-profile-rhysida-ransomware/ \"Threat Profile: Rhysida Ransomware\")  ]### **INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE** On November 10, 2023, Sophos published TTPs and IOCs identified from analysis conducted for six separate incidents.\\[ [9](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/11/10/vice-society-and-rhysida-ransomware/ \"Same threats, different ransomware\")  ] The C2 IP addresses listed in Table 3 were derived directly from Sophos\u2019 investigations and are listed on GitHub among other indicators.\\[ [10](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/2311%20Vice%20Society%20-%20Rhysida%20IoCs.csv \"sophoslabs / IoCs\")  ]*Table 3: C2 IP Addresses Used for Rhysida Operations* | **C2 IP Address** || --- || 5\\.39\\.222\\[.]67 || 5\\.255\\.99\\[.]59 || 51\\.77\\.102\\[.]106 || 108\\.62\\.118\\[.]136 || 108\\.62\\.141\\[.]161 || 146\\.70\\.104\\[.]249 || 156\\.96\\.62\\[.]58 || 157\\.154\\.194\\[.]6 | Additional IOCs were obtained from FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC\u2019s investigations and analysis.

organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend incorporating secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles, limiting the impact of ransomware techniques and strengthening overall security posture.

For example, the just\\-in\\-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support the enforcement of PoLP (as well as the zero trust model). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.* **Implement a recovery plan**  to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).* **Maintain offline backups of data**  and regularly maintain backups and their restoration (daily or weekly at minimum).

Additional details requested include: a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host and network\\-based indicators. FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other threat actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\\) at [Ic3\\.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/)  , a local FBI [Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)  , or CISA via the agency\u2019s [Incident Reporting System](https://www.cisa.gov/forms/report)  or its 24/7 Operations Center at [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov)  or by calling 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA (1\\-844\\-729\\-2472\\).### **REFERENCES**1.
