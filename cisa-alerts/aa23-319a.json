Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.\n2. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, VPN, and accounts that access critical systems.\n3. Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n***Note:** \n This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing* \n[*\\#StopRansomware*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*effort to publish advisories for network defenders detailing various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi\\-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\\-ISAC) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Rhysida ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through investigations as recently as September 2023\\. Rhysida\u2014an emerging ransomware variant\u2014has predominately been deployed against the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors since May 2023\\. The information in this CSA is derived from related incident response investigations and malware analysis of samples discovered on victim networks.\n \n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Rhysida ransomware and other ransomware incidents.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-319A \\#StopRansomware: Rhysida Ransomware](/sites/default/files/2023-11/aa23-319a-stopransomware-rhysida-ransomware_1.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 674\\.56 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-319A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2023-11/AA23-319A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 115\\.31 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-319A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2023-11/AA23-319A%20StopRansomware%20Rhysida%20Ransomware.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 65\\.69 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/ \"ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise\") \n framework, version 14\\. See the ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables mapped to the threat actors\u2019 activity.\n \n\n\n#### **Overview**\n\n\n\n Threat actors leveraging Rhysida ransomware are known to impact \u201ctargets of opportunity,\u201d including victims in the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors. Open source reporting details similarities between Vice Society (DEV\\-0832\\)\\[\n [1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/25/dev-0832-vice-society-opportunistic-ransomware-campaigns-impacting-us-education-sector/ \"DEV-0832 (Vice Society) opportunistic ransomware campaigns impacting US education sector\") \n ] activity and the actors observed deploying Rhysida ransomware. Additionally, open source reporting\\[\n [2](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-rhysida \"Ransomware Roundup - Rhysida\") \n ] has confirmed observed instances of Rhysida actors operating in a ransomware\\-as\\-a\\-service (RaaS) capacity, where ransomware tools and infrastructure are leased out in a profit\\-sharing model. Any ransoms paid are then split between the group and the affiliates.\n \n\n\n\n For additional information on Vice Society actors and associated activity, see the joint CSA\n [\\#StopRansomware: Vice Society](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-249a-0 \"#StopRansomware: Vice Society\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Initial Access**\n\n\n\n Rhysida actors have been observed leveraging external\\-facing remote services to initially access and persist within a network. Remote services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. Rhysida actors have commonly been observed authenticating to internal VPN access points with compromised valid credentials \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ], notably due to organizations lacking MFA enabled by default. Additionally, actors have been observed exploiting Zerologon (\n [CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472 \"CVE-2020-1472 Detail\") \n )\u2014a critical elevation of privileges vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Netlogon Remote Protocol \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ]\u2014as well as conducting successful phishing attempts \\[\n [T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/ \"Phishing\") \n ].\n **Note:** \n Microsoft released a patch for CVE\\-2020\\-1472 on August 11, 2020\\.\\[\n [3](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472 \"Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\") \n ]\n \n\n\n#### **Living off the Land**\n\n\n\n Analysis identified Rhysida actors using living off the land techniques, such as creating Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections for lateral movement \\[\n [T1021\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/001/ \"Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\") \n ], establishing VPN access, and utilizing PowerShell \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\") \n ]. Living off the land techniques include using native (built into the operating system) network administration tools to perform operations. This allows the actors to evade detection by blending in with normal Windows systems and network activities.\n \n\n\n\n`Ipconfig` \n \\[\n [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\") \n ],\n `whoami` \n \\[\n [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1033/ \"System Owner/User Discovery\") \n ],\n `nltest` \n \\[\n [T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1482/ \"Domain Trust Discovery\") \n ], and several\n `net` \n commands have been used to enumerate victim environments and gather information about domains. In one instance of using compromised credentials, actors leveraged\n `net` \n commands within PowerShell to identify logged\\-in users and performed reconnaissance on network accounts within the victim environment.\n **Note:** \n The following commands were not performed in the exact order listed.\n \n\n\n* `net user [username] /domain` \n \\[\n [T1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1087/002/ \"Account Discovery: Domain Account\") \n ]\n* `net group \u201cdomain computers\u201d /domain` \n \\[\n [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1018/ \"Remote System Discovery\") \n ]\n* `net group \u201cdomain admins\u201d /domain` \n \\[\n [T1069\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/002/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Domain Groups\") \n ]\n* `net localgroup administrators` \n \\[\n [T1069\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/001/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Local Groups\") \n ]\n\n\n\n Analysis of the master file table (MFT)\\[\n [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table \"Master File Table (Local File Systems)\") \n ] identified the victim system generated the\n `ntuser.dat` \n registry hive, which was created when the compromised user logged in to the system for the first time. This was considered anomalous due to the baseline of normal activity for that particular user and system.\n **Note:** \n The\n [MFT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table \"Master File Table (Local File Systems)\") \n resides within the New Technology File System (NTFS) and houses information about a file including its size, time and date stamps, permissions, and data content.\n \n\n\n#### **Leveraged Tools**\n\n\n\n Table 1 lists legitimate tools Rhysida actors have repurposed for their operations. The legitimate tools listed in this joint CSA are all publicly available. Use of these tools should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support they are used at the direction of or controlled by threat actors.\n \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** \n Organizations are encouraged to investigate and vet use of these tools prior to performing remediation actions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Tools Leveraged by Rhysida Actors* \n\n| **Name** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| cmd.exe | The native command line prompt utility. |\n| PowerShell.exe | A native command line tool used to start a Windows PowerShell session in a Command Prompt window. |\n| PsExec.exe | A tool included in the PsTools suite used to execute processes remotely. Rhysida actors heavily leveraged this tool for lateral movement and remote execution. |\n| mstsc.exe | A native tool that establishes an RDP connection to a host. |\n| PuTTY.exe | Rhysida actors have been observed creating Secure Shell (SSH) PuTTy connections for lateral movement. In one example, analysis of PowerShell console host history for a compromised user account revealed Rhysida actors leveraged PuTTy to remotely connect to systems via SSH \\[  [T1021\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/004/ \"Remote Services: SSH\")   ]. |\n| PortStarter | A back door script written in Go that provides functionality for modifying firewall settings and opening ports to pre\\-configured command and control (C2\\) servers.\\[  [1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/25/dev-0832-vice-society-opportunistic-ransomware-campaigns-impacting-us-education-sector/)   ] |\n| secretsdump | A script used to extract credentials and other confidential information from a system. Rhysida actors have been observed using this for NTDS dumping \\[  [T1003\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/003/ \"OS Credential Dumping: NTDS\")   ] in various instances. |\n| ntdsutil.exe | A standard Windows tool used to interact with the NTDS database. Rhysida actors used this tool to extract and dump the  `NTDS.dit`   database from the domain controller containing hashes for all Active Directory (AD) users.    **Note:**   It is strongly recommended that organizations conduct domain\\-wide password resets and double Kerberos TGT password resets if any indication is found that the  `NTDS.dit`   file was compromised. |\n| AnyDesk | A common software that can be maliciously used by threat actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence \\[  [T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/ \"Remote Access Software\")   ]. AnyDesk also supports remote file transfer. |\n| wevtutil.exe | A standard Windows Event Utility tool used to view event logs. Rhysida actors used this tool to clear a significant number of Windows event logs, including system, application, and security logs \\[  [T1070\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\")   ]. |\n| PowerView | A PowerShell tool used to gain situational awareness of Windows domains. Review of PowerShell event logs identified Rhysida actors using this tool to conduct additional reconnaissance\\-based commands and harvest credentials. |\n\n\n#### **Rhysida Ransomware Characteristics**\n\n\n##### ***Execution***\n\n\n\n In one investigation, Rhysida actors created two folders in the C:\\\\ drive labeled\n `in` \n and\n `out` \n , which served as a staging directory (central location) for hosting malicious executables. The\n `in` \n folder contained file names in accordance with host names on the victim\u2019s network, likely imported through a scanning tool. The\n `out` \n folder contained various files listed in Table 2 below. Rhysida actors deployed these tools and scripts to assist system and network\\-wide encryption.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 2: Malicious Executables Affiliated with Rhysida Infections* \n\n| **File Name** | **Hash (SHA256\\)** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| conhost.exe | 6633fa85bb234a75927b23417313e51a4c155e12f71da3959e168851a600b010 | A ransomware binary. |\n| psexec.exe | 078163d5c16f64caa5a14784323fd51451b8c831c73396b967b4e35e6879937b | A file used to execute a process on a remote or local host. |\n| S\\_0\\.bat | 1c4978cd5d750a2985da9b58db137fc74d28422f1e087fd77642faa7efe7b597 | A batch script likely used to place  `1.ps1`   on victim systems for ransomware staging purposes \\[  [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/003/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\")   ]. |\n| 1\\.ps1 | 4e34b9442f825a16d7f6557193426ae7a18899ed46d3b896f6e4357367276183 | Identifies an extension block list of files to encrypt and not encrypt. |\n| S\\_1\\.bat | 97766464d0f2f91b82b557ac656ab82e15cae7896b1d8c98632ca53c15cf06c4 | A batch script that copies  `conhost.exe`   (the encryption binary) on an imported list of host names within the  `C:\\Windows\\Temp`   directory of each system. |\n| S\\_2\\.bat | 918784e25bd24192ce4e999538be96898558660659e3c624a5f27857784cd7e1 | Executes  `conhost.exe`   on compromised victim systems, which encrypts and appends the extension of  `.Rhysida`   across the environment. |\n\n\n\n Rhysida ransomware uses a Windows 64\\-bit Portable Executable (PE) or common object file format (COFF) compiled using MinGW via the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which supports various programming languages such as C, C\\+\\+, and Go. The cryptographic ransomware application first injects the PE into running processes on the compromised system \\[\n [T1055\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1055/002/ \"Process Injection: Portable Executable Injection\") \n ]. Additionally, third\\-party researchers identified evidence of Rhysida actors developing custom tools with program names set to \u201cRhysida\\-0\\.1\u201d \\[\n [T1587](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1587/ \"Develop Capabilities\") \n ].\n \n\n\n##### ***Encryption***\n\n\n\n After mapping the network, the ransomware encrypts data using a 4096\\-bit RSA encryption key with a ChaCha20 algorithm \\[\n [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1486/ \"Data Encrypted for Impact\") \n ]. The algorithm features a 256\\-bit key, a 32\\-bit counter, and a 96\\-bit nonce along with a four\\-by\\-four matrix of 32\\-bit words in plain text.

These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, and TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n\n These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend incorporating secure\\-by\\-design and \\-default principles, limiting the impact of ransomware techniques and strengthening overall security posture.

These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.\n* **Restrict the use of RDP and other remote desktop services to known user accounts and groups.** \n If RDP is necessary, apply best practices such as \\[\n [CPG 2\\.W](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]:\n\t+ Implement MFA for privileged accounts using RDP.\n\t+ Use Remote Credential Guard\\[\n\t [14](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/remote-credential-guard?tabs=intune \"Remote Credential Guard\") \n\t ] to protect credentials, particularly domain administrator or other high value accounts.\n\t+ Audit the network for systems using RDP.\n\t+ Close unused RDP ports.\n\t+ Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts.\n\t+ Log RDP login attempts.\n* Secure remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Implementing application controls** \n\t to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs. Application controls should prevent the installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important as antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n\t+ Apply the recommendations in CISA's joint\n\t [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf \"GUIDE TO SECURING REMOTE ACCESS SOFTWARE\") \n\t .\n\n\n\n In addition, FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:\n \n\n\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \n in internet\\-facing systems \\[\n [CPG 1\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Segment networks** \n to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a network monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host \\[\n [CPG 3\\.A](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Audit user accounts** \n with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) \\[\n [CPG 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Implement time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.A, 2\\.E](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]. For example, the just\\-in\\-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support the enforcement of PoLP (as well as the zero trust model). This is a process where a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.\n* **Implement a recovery plan** \n to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).\n* **Maintain offline backups of data** \n and regularly maintain backups and their restoration (daily or weekly at minimum). By instituting this practice, organizations limit the severity of disruption to business operations \\[\n [CPG 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable** \n (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure \\[\n [CPG 2\\.K, 2\\.L, 2\\.R](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Forward log files to a hardened centralized logging server,** \n preferably on a segmented network\n \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.F](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ]. Review logging retention rates, such as for VPNs and network\\-based logs.\n* **Consider adding an email banner to emails** \n received from outside your organization \\[\n [CPG 2\\.M](/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals March 2023 Update\") \n ].\n* **Disable hyperlinks** \n in received emails.\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 6\\-15\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and the MS\\-ISAC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [CISA: \\#StopRansomware](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n* [CISA: \\#StopRansomware Vice Society](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-249a-0 \"#StopRansomware: Vice Society\")\n* [CISA: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")\n* [NIST: CVE\\-2020\\-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472 \"CVE-2020-1472 Detail\")\n* [CISA, MITRE: Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Mapping\")\n* [CISA: Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\")\n* [CISA: Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")\n* [CISA: Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\")\n* [CISA: Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\")\n* [CISA: Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\")\n\n\n### **REPORTING**\n\n\n\n FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Rhysida actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\n \n\n\n\n Additional details requested include: a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host and network\\-based indicators.\n \n\n\n\n FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other threat actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.
