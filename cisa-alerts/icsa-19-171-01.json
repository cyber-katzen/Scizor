EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Phoenix Contact\nEquipment: Automation Worx Software Suite\nVulnerabilities: Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Out-of-bounds Read, Use After Free\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker, with access to an original PC Worx or Config+ project file, to perform remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components of Automation Worx Software Suite Version 1.86 and earlier are affected:\n\nPC Worx\nPC Worx Express\nConfig+\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nAn access of uninitialized pointer vulnerability may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12870 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12869 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nA use after free vulnerability may allow remote code execution.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12871 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\n9sg Security Team working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. CERT@VDE coordinated these vulnerabilities with Phoenix Contact.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPhoenix Contact is currently working on the next version of the Automation Worx Software Suite. This advisory will be updated with details of the new version when it becomes available.\nPhoenix Contact recommends users exchange project files using only secure file exchange services, and that project files should not be exchanged via unencrypted email.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
