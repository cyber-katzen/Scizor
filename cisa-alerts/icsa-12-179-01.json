Each of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, and public exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.ICS-CERT has coordinated these vulnerabilities with the development and manufacturing company of Pro-face branded products, Digital Electronics, which has produced an update that resolves these vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nDigital Electronics reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products.\n\ndata management software Pro-Server EX versions 1.00.00 through 1.30.00, and\nHMI screen editor and logic programming software GP-Pro EX and related software WinGP Versions 2.00.00 through 3.01.100.\n\nImpact\nExploitation of the reported vulnerabilities can result in a denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution.Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nPro-face is HMI-related hardware and software product found in a wide range of industries such as oil and gas, food and beverage, and water and wastewater industries. Pro-face products are used throughout the world, the highest number sold in Japan and the Asian Pacific area. According to its Web site, Pro-Server EX is a data management server that collects information generated by a PLC system through an HMI unit and generates reports. In February 2001, Pro-face America, Inc., a subsidiary of Digital Electronics Corporation, purchased Xycom Automation.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nMemory CorruptionCWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012.\nA specially crafted packet can cause an integer overflow that leads to a buffer overflow in an arbitrary memory location. Out-of-bounds memory access may result in the corruption of memory or instructions that may lead to a crash. The execution of arbitrary code may be possible. Other attacks leading to lack of availability may also be possible.CVE-2012-3792NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3792, Web site last visited June 27, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P).\nInteger OverflowCWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/680.html, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012.\nIt is possible to exploit an integer overflow to crash the server which could be considered a denial of service.CVE-2012-3793NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3793, Web site last visited June 27, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).\nUnhandled ExceptionCWE-388: Error Handling, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/388.html, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012.\nIt is possible to terminate the server because of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause a denial-of-service condition.CVE-2012-3794NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3794, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).\nInvalid Memory Read AccessCWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\nAn attacker may crash the server by copying a large amount of memory from the target system.CVE-2012-3795NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3795, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012. and CVE-2012-3796NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3796, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012. have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P).\nMemory CorruptionsCWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/788.html, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012.\nAn attacker is able to write more data to a memory location than is allocated due to a lack of size checks. This will likely result in a system crash.CVE-2012-3797NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3797, Web site last accessed June 27, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a moderate skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nDigital Electronics has released patch modules on its Web site at the following location: http://www.pro-face.com/news/2012/0606.html.The patch module prevents the Pro-Server EX and WinGP from an attack using inaccurate packets.Digital Electronics recommends the following in addition to applying the patch:\n\nReview all network configurations for control system devices.\nRemove unnecessary PCs from control system networks.\nRemove unnecessary applications from control system networks.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
