RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute\\-force attack.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  The following versions of Siemens SIMATIC HMI Products are affected:* SIMATIC HMI Basic Panels, 2nd Generation (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to v16 are affected by [CVE\\-2020\\-15786](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15786)* SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions up to and including v16 are affected by [CVE\\-2020\\-15786](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15786)* SIMATIC HMI Mobile Panels: All versions up to and including v16 are affected by [CVE\\-2020\\-15786](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15786)* SIMATIC HMI United Comfort Panels: All versions up to and including v16**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE\\-307](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html) Affected devices insufficiently block excessive authentication attempts. This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute\\-force attack.[CVE\\-2020\\-15786](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15786)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY PRIMARY WEAKNESS CWE\\-305](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html) Affected devices insufficiently validate authentication attempts as the information given can be truncated to match only a set number of characters versus the whole provided string. This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute\\-force attack.[CVE\\-2020\\-15787](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15787)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Joseph Gardiner from Bristol Cyber Security Group, University of Bristol, reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends users update to the latest versions.* SIMATIC HMI Basic Panels 2nd Generation: [Update to v16 Update 3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775861)* SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels: [Update to v16 Update 3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775861)* SIMATIC HMI Mobile Panels: [Update to v16 Update 3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775861)* SIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels: [Update to v16 Update 3](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775861) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply [defense\\-in\\-depth](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  strategies.* For Unified Comfort Panels using SmartClient: The password truncation ( [CVE\\-2020\\-15787](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15787)  ) cannot be resolved due to RFC 6143 and is limited to 8 characters. Complex passwords are recommended.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
