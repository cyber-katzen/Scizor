MITIGATIONS--------------- Red Lion recommends users apply the [latest patches](https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/articles/19338927539981-SixTRAK-and-VersaTRAK-Security-Patch-RLCSIM-2023-05)  to their products. Red Lion recommends users apply additional mitigations to help reduce the risk:* Enable user authentication, see [Red Lion instructions](https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/articles/18190385510797-ACCESS-RTU-and-IO-How-to-install-a-patch-or-package-to-the-RTU)  . Blocking all or most Sixnet UDR messages over TCP/IP will eliminate authentication bypass. Sixnet UDR messages over TCP/IP will be ignored. To block all Sixnet UDR messages over TCP/IP install Patch1\\_tcp\\_udr\\_all\\_blocked.tar.gz.* ST\\-IPm\\-8460 \u2013 Install 8313\\_patch1\\_tcp\\_udr\\_all\\_blocked.tar.gz* ST\\-IPm\\-6350/VT\\-mIPm\\-245\\-D/VT\\-mIPm\\-135\\-D/VT\\-IPm2m\\-213\\-D/VT\\-IPm2m\\-113\\-D \u2013 Install 855\\_patch1\\_tcp\\_udr\\_all\\_blocked.tar.gz To block all Sixnet UDR messages except I/O commands over TCP/IP and UDP/IP install Patch2\\_io\\_open.tar.gz.* ST\\-IPm\\-8460 \u2013 Install 8313\\_patch2\\_io\\_open.tar.gz* ST\\-IPm\\-6350/VT\\-mIPm\\-245\\-D/VT\\-mIPm\\-135\\-D/VT\\-IPm2m\\-213\\-D/VT\\-IPm2m\\-113\\-D \u2013 Install 855\\_patch2\\_io\\_open.tar.gz To Block all Sixnet UDR messages over TCP/IP:* Enable iptables rules to block TCP/IP traffic.* In the Sixnet I/O Tool Kit go to Configuration\\>Configuration Station/Module\\>\"Ports\" tab\\>Security.* Select the \"Load the this file with each station load\" radio button to load a custom rc.firewall configuration file. The rules below will allow all other traffic except Sixnet UDR over TCP/IP. Please Note: Two rules that are added in by default were removed because they will block all traffic going into the interface. Remove these rules from the default rc.firewall file:* iptables \\-P INPUT DROP (Drops everything coming in)* iptables \\-P FORWARD DROP (Drops everything in FORWARD chain) Add one DROP rule which will drop all TCP/IP packet coming on UDR port 1594 by typing the following commands:* insmodip\\_tables (Initialization)* insmodiptable\\_filter (Initialization)* insmodip\\_conntrack (Initialization)* insmodiptable\\_nat (Initialization)* iptables \\-F INPUT (Flushes INPUT chain)* iptables \\-F OUTPUT (Flushes OUTPUT chain)* iptables \\-F FORWARD (Flushes FORWARD chain)* iptables \\-Z (Zero counters)* iptables \\-P OUTPUT ACCEPT (Drops everything coming in, everything in FORWARD chain, and accepts everything going out)* iptables \\-A INPUT \\-p tcp \\-\\-dport 1594 \\-j DROP (Allows local traffic and blocks all TCP traffic coming from 1594\\) For installation instructions see [Red Lion's support page](https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/articles/18190385510797-ACCESS-RTU-and-IO-How-to-install-a-patch-or-package-to-the-RTU)  .

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
