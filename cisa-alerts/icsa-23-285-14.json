[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHikvision Access Control and Intercom Products============================================== Release Date October 12, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-285\\-14**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3**  7\\.5* **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely* **Vendor:**  Hikvision* **Equipment:**  Access Control and Intercom Products* **Vulnerabilities:**  Session Fixation, Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker hijacking a session and gaining device operation permissions or result in an attacker modifying device network configuration by sending specific data packets to a vulnerable interface within the same local network.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Access Control and Intercom Products are affected:* DS\\-K1T804AXX: V1\\.4\\.0\\_build221212 and prior.* DS\\-K1T341AXX: V3\\.2\\.30\\_build221223 and prior.* DS\\-K1T671XXX: V3\\.2\\.30\\_build221223 and prior.* DS\\-K1T343XXX: V3\\.14\\.0\\_build230117 and prior.* DS\\-K1T341C: V3\\.3\\.8\\_build230112 and prior.* DS\\-K1T320XXX: V3\\.5\\.0\\_build220706 and prior.* DS\\-KH63 Series: V2\\.2\\.8\\_build230219 and prior.* DS\\-KH85 Series: V2\\.2\\.8\\_build230219 and prior.* DS\\-KH62 Series: V1\\.4\\.62\\_build220414 and prior.* DS\\-KH9310\\-WTE1(B): V2\\.1\\.76\\_build230204 and prior.* DS\\-KH9510\\-WTE1(B): V2\\.1\\.76\\_build230204 and prior.### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [SESSION FIXATION CWE\\-384](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html)** Some access control products are vulnerable to a session hijacking attack because the product does not update the session ID after a user successfully logs in. To exploit the vulnerability, attackers have to request the session ID at the same time a valid user logs in, and gain device operation permissions by forging the IP and session ID of an authenticated user.[CVE\\-2023\\-28809](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28809)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** Some access control/intercom products have unauthorized modification of device network configuration vulnerabilities. Attackers can modify device network configuration by sending specific data packets to the vulnerable interface within the same local network.[CVE\\-2023\\-28810](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-28810)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  China### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER These vulnerabilities were reported to HSRC by Andres Hinnosaar with the support of NATO CCDCOE and Peter Szot from Skylight Cyber. Hikvision reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hikvision recommends users download patches/updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The upgrade can be downloaded from the Hikvision [official website](https://www.hikvision.com/en/support/download/firmware/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
