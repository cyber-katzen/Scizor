EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: FactoryTalk Historian SE\nVulnerabilities: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Historian SE, a data management application, are affected:\n\nFactoryTalk Historian SE: Versions v9.0 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 MISSING RELEASE OF RESOURCE AFTER EFFECTIVE LIFETIME CWE-772\nFactoryTalk Historian SE utilizes the AVEVA PI Server, which contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to cause a partial denial-of-service condition in the PI Message Subsystem of a PI Server by consuming available memory. This vulnerability exists in FactoryTalk Historian SE versions 9.0 and earlier. Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause FactoryTalk Historian SE to become unavailable, requiring a power cycle to recover it.\nCVE-2023-31274 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2023-31274. A base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER CHECK OR HANDLING OF EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE-703\nFactoryTalk Historian SE uses the AVEVA PI Server, which contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to remotely crash the PI Message Subsystem of a PI Server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. This vulnerability exists in FactoryTalk Historian SE versions 9.0 and earlier. Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause FactoryTalk Historian SE to become unavailable, requiring a power cycle to recover it.\nCVE-2023-34348 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2023-34348. A base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released product updates addressing this vulnerability:\n\nFactoryTalk Historian SE: Users using the affected software are encouraged to install FactoryTalk Historian SE version 9.01 or higher as soon as feasible.\n\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation's article.(Login Required)\nFor more information about the AVEVA PI and AVEVA Edge products, see AVEVA-2024-001 and AVEVA-2024-002\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
