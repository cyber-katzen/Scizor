See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/) \n framework for all referenced threat actor techniques.* \n\n\n\n\n The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has observed cyber actors using emails containing a Microsoft Word document with a malicious Visual Basic Application (VBA) macro code to deploy KONNI malware. KONNI is a remote administration tool (RAT) used by malicious cyber actors to steal files, capture keystrokes, take screenshots, and execute arbitrary code on infected hosts.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n KONNI malware is often delivered via phishing emails as a Microsoft Word document with a malicious VBA macro code (\n *Phishing: Spearphising Attachment* \n \\[\n [T1566\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001/) \n ]). The malicious code can change the font color from light grey to black (to fool the user to enable content), check if the Windows operating system is a 32\\-bit or 64\\-bit version, and construct and execute the command line to download additional files (\n *Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell* \n \\[\n [T1059\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/003/) \n ]).\n \n\n\n\n Once the VBA macro constructs the command line, it uses the certificate database tool CertUtil to download remote files from a given Uniform Resource Locator. It also incorporates a built\\-in function to decode base64\\-encoded files. The Command Prompt silently copies\n `certutil.exe` \n into a temp directory and renames it to evade detection.\n \n\n\n\n The cyber actor then downloads a text file from a remote resource containing a base64\\-encoded string that is decoded by CertUtil and saved as a batch (.BAT) file. Finally, the cyber actor deletes the text file from the temp directory and executes the .BAT file.\n \n\n\n### MITRE ATT\\&CK Techniques\n\n\n\n According to MITRE,\n [KONNI](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0356/) \n uses the ATT\\&CK techniques listed in table 1\\.\n \n\n\n\n*Table 1: KONNI ATT\\&CK techniques* \n\n\n\n\n\n| **Technique** | **Use** |\n| --- | --- |\n| *System Network Configuration Discovery*   \\[  [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1016)   ] | KONNI can collect the Internet Protocol address from the

administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n \n\n\n* Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. See\n [Protecting Against Malicious Code](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST18-271) \n .\n* Keep operating system patches up to date. See\n [Understanding Patches and Software Updates](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006) \n .\n* Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use\n [strong passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) \n or Active Directory authentication.\n* Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators\u2019 group unless required.\n* Enforce a strong password policy. See\n [Choosing and Protecting Passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) \n .\n* Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. See\n [Using Caution with Email Attachments](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-010) \n .\n* Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\n* Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\n* Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\n* Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\n* Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs).\n* Scan all software downloaded from the internet prior to executing.\n* Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate access control lists.\n* Visit the MITRE ATT\\&CK Techniques pages (linked in table 1 above) for additional mitigation and detection strategies.\n\n\n\n For additional information on malware incident prevention and handling, see the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800\\-83, \"\n [Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-83/rev-1/final) \n .\"\n \n\n\n### Resources\n\n\n* [d\\-hunter \u2013 A Look Into KONNI 2019 Campaign](https://medium.com/d-hunter/a-look-into-konni-2019-campaign-b45a0f321e9b%20)\n* [MITRE ATT\\&CK \u2013 KONNI](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0356/)\n* [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/)\n\n\n\n### Revisions\n\n\n\n\n August 14, 2020: Initial Version\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-227a) \n ;
