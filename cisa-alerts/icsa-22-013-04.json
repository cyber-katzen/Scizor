MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to [v8\\.83 or later versions](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/ps/24237/dl)  Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). Siemens also encourages users to configure the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Siemens also recommends following [security guidelines for Digital Grid Products](https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity)  . For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-439673](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-439673.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  .
