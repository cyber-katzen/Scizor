EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Iagona\nEquipment: ScrutisWeb\nVulnerabilities: Absolute Path Traversal, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Iagona ScrutisWeb, a web application, are affected:\n\nScrutisWeb: Version 2.1.37 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0ABSOLUTE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-36\nIagona ScrutisWeb versions 2.1.37 and prior are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to directly access any file outside the webroot.\nCVE-2023-33871 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER-CONTROLLED KEY CWE-639\nIagona ScrutisWeb versions 2.1.37 and prior are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to view profile information, including user login names and encrypted passwords.\nCVE-2023-38257 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nIagona ScrutisWeb versions 2.1.37 and prior are vulnerable to a cryptographic vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to decrypt encrypted passwords into plaintext.\nCVE-2023-35763 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nIagona ScrutisWeb versions 2.1.37 and prior are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated user to upload a malicious payload and execute it.\nCVE-2023-35189 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNeil Graves, Jorian van den Hout, and Malcolm Stagg reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nIagona has developed and released Iagona ScrutisWeb v2.1.38.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
