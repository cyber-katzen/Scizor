EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit/public exploits are available\nVendor: ENTTEC\nEquipment: Datagate Mk2, Storm 24, Pixelator, E-Streamer Mk2\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Cross-site Scripting, Improper Access Control, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-177-01 ENTTEC Lighting Controllers that was published June 25, 2020, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized SSH/SCP access to devices, inject malicious code, run commands with root privileges, and read, write, and execute files in system directories as any user.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nENTTEC reports these vulnerabilities affect firmware Version 70044_update_05032019-482 and prior for the following lighting control products:\u00a0\n\nDatagate Mk2\nStorm 24\nPixelator\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nE-Streamer Mk2 (End of Life)\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nThe lighting controller products include hard-coded SSH keys for remote SSH and SCP access as the root user.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12776 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nSeveral stored XSS vulnerabilities have been identified in ENTTEC\u2019s Datagate Mk2 web configuration software, which could allow an unauthenticated threat actor to inject malicious code directly into the application.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12774 has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe lighting controller products enable high privileged root access via sudo capability without requiring appropriate access control.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12775 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\nThe system replaces permissions by the underlying operating system with highly insecure read, write, and execute directory permissions for all users.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-12777 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Australia\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMark Cross reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nENTTEC has released RevB (June 2020) firmware that provides additional security measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities. ENTTEC recommends the Datagate Mk2, Storm 24, and Pixelator units should be updated to RevB (June 2020) firmware or newer. Once the firmware is updated and the device is configured, ENTTEC recommends locking the unit via the front panel menu. For more information see the ENTTEC Security bulletin.\u00a0\nThe E-Streamer Mk2 is discontinued and is no longer supported by ENTTEC. ENTTEC recommends upgrading to the S-PLAY to replace this product.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nENTTEC recommends\u00a0devices should be located behind appropriate firewalls and network controls, and not accessible from the Internet.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
