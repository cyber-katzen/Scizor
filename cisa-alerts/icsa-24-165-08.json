EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, NULL Pointer Dereference\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition or execute code within the context of the current process.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products, are affected:\n\nSiemens JT2Go: All versions prior to V2312.0004\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V14.2: All Versions\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V14.3: All versions prior to V14.3.0.9\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V2312: All versions prior to V2312.0004\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected applications contain an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted X_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2024-26275 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-26275.A base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).\n3.2.2 ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE-770\nThe affected application contains a stack exhaustion vulnerability while parsing a specially crafted X_T file. This could allow an attacker to cause denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2024-26276 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-26276.A base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).\n3.2.3 NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe affected applications contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing specially crafted X_T files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2024-26277 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-26277.A base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Defense Industrial Base, and Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nJT2Go, Teamcenter Visualization V14.2, Teamcenter Visualization V14.3, Teamcenter Visualization V2312: Do not open untrusted XT files in Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.2: Currently no fix is available\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.3: Update to V14.3.0.9 or later version\nJT2Go: Update to V2312.0004 or later versionhttps://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/plm-components/jt/jt2go/\nTeamcenter Visualization V2312: Update to V2312.0004 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-771940 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJune 13, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
