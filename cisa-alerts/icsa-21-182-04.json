This vulnerability may allow an attacker to impersonate an administrator and tamper with information (e.g., operation information and configuration of the air conditioning system).[CVE\\-2021\\-20593](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20593)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Chizuru Toyama of TXOne IoT/ICS Security Research Labs, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric has created the following versions to address the issue, and recommends users update to one of the following versions below or newer:* Air Conditioning System/Centralized Controllers:\t+ G\\-50A: Version 3\\.37 or later\t+ GB\\-50A: Version 3\\.37 or later\t+ AG\\-150A\\-A: Version 3\\.21 or later\t+ AG\\-150A\\-J: Version 3\\.21 or later\t+ GB\\-50ADA\\-A: Version 3\\.21 or later\t+ GB\\-50ADA\\-J: Version 3\\.21 or later\t+ EB\\-50GU\\-A: Version 7\\.10 or later\t+ EB\\-50GU\\-J: Version 7\\.10 or later\t+ AE\\-200A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ AE\\-200E: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ AE\\-50A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ AE\\-50E: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ EW\\-50A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ EW\\-50E: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ TE\\-200A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ TE\\-50A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ TW\\-50A: Version 7\\.95 or later\t+ CMS\\-RMD\\-J: Version 1\\.40 or later* Air Conditioning System / Expansion Controllers:\t+ PAC\\-YG50ECA: Version 2\\.21 or later Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risks associated with this vulnerability:* Use a VPN router, etc. when connecting the air conditioning system to the Internet.* Use an antivirus software computer on systems used to connect conditioning systems.* Restrict the access to air conditioning systems from untrusted networks and hosts.* Change default usernames and passwords. Please contact a distributor or Mitsubishi Electric representative for available updates. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
