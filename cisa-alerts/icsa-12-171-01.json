This vulnerability was released without coordinating with ICS\\-CERT or the vendor. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and public exploits are known to target this vulnerability. Wonderware SuiteLink is part of the System Platform software suite.\n   \n\n  \n\n ICS\\-CERT has coordinated this vulnerability with Invensys. Invensys has confirmed the vulnerability exists for Wonderware products built prior to 2011\\. Invensys has produced a patch that resolves this vulnerability. This patch validation was confirmed by Luigi Auriemma.\n \n\n\nAffected Products\n-----------------\n\n\n\n All Wonderware products built prior to 2011 are affected:\n \n\n\n* slssvc service less than or equal to Version 54\\.x.x.x is vulnerable, and\n* slssvc service equal to or greater than Version 58\\.x.x.x is not vulnerable.\n\n\n\n  \n\n Slssvc service Versions 55\u201357 were never publicly released. InTouch 2012 and Wonderware Application Server 2012 are not vulnerable to crash but will show excessive resource consumption if exploited.\n \n\n\nImpact\n------\n\n\n\n The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow that can ultimately lead to a denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) and crash of the system in some versions.\n   \n\n  \n\n The vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely stall or crash the slssvc service by sending a long and unallocated Unicode string to the buffer. This exploit could affect critical infrastructure and key resources where Wonderware SuiteLink is deployed.\n   \n\n  \n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\n\n SuiteLink is a common component used for communication between Wonderware products. It is also used for communication between Wonderware products and some third\\-party products developed with Wonderware\u2019s Extensibility Tool Kits. The Invensys Wonderware SuiteLink Service connects Wonderware software with third\\-party products and OPC\\-compliant devices and applications. Generally, when a Wonderware product is installed, SuiteLink is likely also installed as a common component. The SuiteLink service is a common component of the System Platform used to transport value, time, and quality of digital I/O information and extensive diagnostics with high throughput between industrial devices, third party, and Wonderware products.\n   \n\n  \n\n The InvensysInvensys, http://www.invensys.com/, Web site last accessed June 19, 2012\\. Wonderware SuiteLink component is deployed in many industries worldwide, including manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemical, and water and wastewater.\n \n\n\nVulnerability Characterization\n------------------------------\n\n\n### Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n#### Stack\\-Based Buffer OverflowCWE\\-121: Stack Based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, Web site last accessed June 19, 2012\\.\n\n\n\n Attackers can send an oversized unallocated string into the SuiteLink buffer that causes the allocated stack buffer to be overwritten. This attack causes a crash of slssvc.exe and a DoS.\n   \n\n  \n\n CVE\\-2012\\-3007NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-3007, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7\\.1 has also been assigned\n [(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?adv&name=&vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C%29&version=2) \n .\n \n\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\n\n#### Exploitability\n\n\n\n This vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\n \n\n\n#### Existence of Exploit\n\n\n\n Public exploits are known to target this vulnerability.\n \n\n\n#### Difficulty\n\n\n\n An attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\n \n\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\n\n\n Invensys recommends the following mitigations.\n \n\n\n* Apply security update patch to affected nodes.\n* Upgrade to InTouch/Wonderware Application Server (IT 10\\.5, WAS 3\\.5\\) or later.\n* Upgrade to DASABCIP 4\\.1 SP2 or DASSiDirect 3\\.0\\.\n* Install DAServer Runtime Components Upgrade 3\\.0 SP2, 3\\.0 SP3 or higher for any DAServer, DI Object, or third\\-party DAServer installation.\n\n\n\n  \n\n The Invensys security update patch can be found at the\n [Wonderware download Web site](https://wdn.wonderware.com/sites/WDN/Pages/Downloads/Software.aspx,) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. Customers can refer to Invensys Security Central for further security information.\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides\n [a section for control systems security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n . ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Invensys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-12-171-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
