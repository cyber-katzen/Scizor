EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: GE\nEquipment: Reason RT43X Clocks\nVulnerabilities: Code Injection, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system or intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nGE reports the vulnerabilities affect the following GNSS clocks:\u00a0\n\nRT430, RT431 & RT434: All firmware versions prior to Version 08A06\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF (CODE INJECTION) CWE-94\nA code injection vulnerability exists in one of the webpages that could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-25197 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nBy having access to the hard-coded cryptographic key, attackers would be able to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic through an HTTPS connection.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-25193 \u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTom Westenberg of Thales UK reported these vulnerabilities to GE.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGE strongly recommends users of Reason RT43X products update their units to firmware Version 08A06 or greater to resolve these issues. The firmware update addresses both vulnerabilities as described in the Reason RT43X 08A06 Release Notes.\nGE recommends users evaluate current risk and implement appropriate network security mitigation measures as follows. The following mitigation actions do not ensure complete security but should be considered until the affected time synchronization product is upgraded:\n\nUse strong network and physical security protection to prevent an attacker from reaching the local network where Reason RT43X clocks are normally installed.\u00a0\nBlock TCP/IP Ports 80 and 443 to block the HTTP/HTTPS access to web interface with Reason RT43X products, avoiding all the vulnerabilities. This TCP/IP port blocking should be limited to the Ethernet port interface where the Reason RT43X clock is connected (e.g., using Access Control List (ACL)). Otherwise, other HTTP/HTTPS applications may be affected.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nAnalyze security events to early detect unexpected traffic/communication.\n\nPlease see GE publication GES-2020-006 (login required) for more details on these issues.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
