EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Mitsubishi Electric Corporation\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0GOT Mobile Function on GOT2000 Series and GT SoftGOT2000\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to perform unintended operations through clickjacking (an attack that tricks users into clicking an invisible or disguised webpage element) or allow attackers to disclose sensitive information from their browsers or impersonate legitimate users by abusing inappropriate HTML attributes.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nMitsubishi Electric reports these vulnerabilities affect the GOT Mobile Function on the following products:\u00a0\n\nGOT2000 Series:\u00a0\n\nGT27 model: GOT Mobile versions 01.14.000\u201301.47.000\u00a0\nGT25 model: GOT Mobile versions 01.14.000\u201301.47.000\u00a0\n\n\nGT SoftGOT2000: software versions 1.265B\u20131.285X\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY SPOOFING CWE-290\u00a0\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users by abusing inappropriate HTML attributes or cause users' browsers to disclose sensitive information.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40269\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021\u00a0\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to lead legitimate users to perform unintended operations through clickjacking.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40268\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMitsubishi Electric reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users update to the latest software versions. Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s\u00a0security advisory contains step-by-step update instructions:\u00a0\n\nGOT2000 Series\u00a0\n\nGT27 model: Update to GOT Mobile version 01.48.000 or later.\u00a0\nGT25 model: Update to GOT Mobile version 01.48.000 or later.\u00a0\n\n\nGT SoftGOT2000: Update to software version 1.290C or later.\u00a0\n\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigations to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities:\u00a0\n\nWhen internet access is required, use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access.\u00a0\nUse devices within a local area network (LAN) and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.\u00a0\nInstall antivirus software on hosts running affected software/firmware.\u00a0\nUse the IP filter function to control access via IP address.\u00a0\n\nGT Designer3 (GOT2000) Screen Design Manual (SH-081220ENG). \u201c5.4.3 Setting the IP filter\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDisable GOT Mobile Function.\u00a0\n\nUsers should refer to Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s\u00a0security advisory\u00a0for further information.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n",
