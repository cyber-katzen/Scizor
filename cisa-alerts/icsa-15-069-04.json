The process control vulnerability is a result of a third-party DLL, developed by Telerik, which is used in the Elipse E3 application. Elipse has released a new version that mitigates this vulnerability. The researcher has tested Elipse\u2019s new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Elipse E3 versions are affected:\n\nElipse E3, Versions 4.5.232-4.6.161,\nEQATEC.Analytics.Monitor.Win32_vc100.dll (32-bit), and\nEQATEC.Analytics.Monitor.Win32_vc100-x64.dll (64-bit).\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability would require the victim to install and execute malicious code that could result in arbitrary code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nElipse is a Brazil-based company that has business partners in several countries around the world, including the US, Germany, India, Russia, Sweden, Argentina, and Chile.\nThe affected product, Elipse E3, is a supervisory control and data acquisition system for use in critical systems. According to Elipse, Elipse E3 is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing. Elipse estimates that this product is used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPROCESS CONTROLCWE-114: Process Control, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/114.html, web site last accessed March 10, 2015.\n\nThe affected DLL is linked with OpenSSL to support HTTPS communications. The OpenSSL library was unintentionally built with hardware-support, resulting in unintended cryptographic-related DLLs being called at runtime. The unintentional DLL calls may enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code at runtime after convincing a victim to install a malicious DLL called by the application.\nCVE-2015-0978NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0978, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed March 10, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malformed file.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept and load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nElipse has released a new version of its Elipse E3 software, Version 4.6.162, which incorporates the new version of Telerik\u2019s DLLs, Version 3.2.129. Elipse\u2019s new version is available at:\nhttp://www.elipse.com.br/eng/download_e3.aspx\nTelerik\u2019s vulnerable DLLs were discovered in Version 3.2.96 and after being notified, Telerik notified their affected customers. Additional information about Telerik\u2019s new software version is available at:\nhttp://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/analytics/release-history/analytics-monitor-library-v3.2.129\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed March 10, 2015. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed March 10, 2015. for more information on social engineering attacks\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
