EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.4\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: National Instruments\nEquipment: LabVIEW\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-Bounds Read, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a local attacker to disclose information and execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following National Instruments LabVIEW products are affected:\n\nLabVIEW: Versions 24.1f0 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nLabVIEW is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of LabVIEW. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerabilities in that the user must open a malicious VI file.\nCVE-2024-4079 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-4079. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe library tdcore_24_1.dll contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which could allow a local attacker to disclose information or execute arbitrary code on affected installations of LabVIEW. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability in that the user must open a malicious VI file.\nCVE-2024-4080 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-4080. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3 IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nLabVIEW contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which could allow a local attacker to disclose information or execute arbitrary code on affected installations of LabVIEW. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability in that the user must open a malicious VI file.\nCVE-2024-4081 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-4081. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Defense Industrial Base, Information Technology, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nNational Instruments has provided a fix for these issues and recommends users to refer to their public advisories:\n\nhttps://www.ni.com/en/support/security/available-critical-and-security-updates-for-ni-software/out-of-bounds-read-due-to-missing-bounds-check-in-labview.html\nhttps://www.ni.com/en/support/security/available-critical-and-security-updates-for-ni-software/memory-corruption-issues-due-to-improper-length-checks-in-labview.html\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJuly 23, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
