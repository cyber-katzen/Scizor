EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: MicroDicom\nEquipment: DICOM Viewer\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-Bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause memory corruption issues leading to execution of arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MicroDicom DICOM Viewer, a medical image viewer, are affected:\n\nMicroDicom DICOM Viewer: Versions 2023.3 (Build 9342) and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nMicroDicom DICOM Viewer versions 2023.3 (Build 9342) and prior are affected by a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of DICOM Viewer. A user must open a malicious DCM file in order to exploit the vulnerability.\nCVE-2024-22100\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nMicroDicom DICOM Viewer versions 2023.3 (Build 9342) and prior contain a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which could result in memory corruption within the application.\nCVE-2024-25578\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Bulgaria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nMicroDicom has provided a fix and recommends users upgrade to\u00a02024.1.\nFor additional assistance,\u00a0contact MicroDicom\u00a0directly\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 29, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
