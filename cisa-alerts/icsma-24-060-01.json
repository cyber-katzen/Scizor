EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : MicroDicom* **Equipment**  : DICOM Viewer* **Vulnerabilities**  : Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-Bounds Write2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause memory corruption issues leading to execution of arbitrary code.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of MicroDicom DICOM Viewer, a medical image viewer, are affected:* MicroDicom DICOM Viewer: Versions 2023\\.3 (Build 9342\\) and prior### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)** MicroDicom DICOM Viewer versions 2023\\.3 (Build 9342\\) and prior are affected by a heap\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of DICOM Viewer. A user must open a malicious DCM file in order to exploit the vulnerability.[CVE\\-2024\\-22100](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-22100)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** MicroDicom DICOM Viewer versions 2023\\.3 (Build 9342\\) and prior contain a lack of proper validation of user\\-supplied data, which could result in memory corruption within the application.[CVE\\-2024\\-25578](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-25578)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Bulgaria### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- MicroDicom has provided a fix and recommends users upgrade to [2024\\.1](https://www.microdicom.com/)  . For additional assistance, [contact MicroDicom](https://www.microdicom.com/contacts.html)  directly CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
