[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAccuenergy Acuvim II Series AXM\\-NET Module Vulnerabilities=========================================================== Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-105\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Maxim Rupp has identified authentication bypass vulnerabilities in Accuenergy\u2019s Acuvim II Series AXM\\-NET module. Accuenergy has produced guidelines to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Accuenergy versions are affected:* Acuvim II NET Firmware, Version 3\\.08* Acuvim IIR NET Firmware, Version 3\\.08IMPACT------ The authentication bypass vulnerability allows access to the settings on the Ethernet module web server interface without authenticating. A malicious user could create a denial\\-of\\-service condition for the power meter by changing the network settings. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Accuenergy is a Canada\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and China. The affected product, Acuvim II, is a multifunction power metering device. The AXM\\-NET Ethernet module creates a web page to display data produced by the Acuvim II. According to Accuenergy, Acuvim II is deployed in the Energy sector. Accuenergy estimates that this product is used primarily in North America and China.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### AUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE\\-592:Authentication Bypass Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592\\.html, web site last accessed April 14, 2016\\.

It is available at:[https://www.accuenergy.com/page/articles/protecting\\-your\\-modbus\\-tcp\\-ip\\-meter\\-from\\-security\\-risks](https://www.accuenergy.com/page/articles/protecting-your-modbus-tcp-ip-meter-from-security-risks)  ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
