Accuenergy has produced guidelines to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Accuenergy versions are affected:\n\nAcuvim II\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NET Firmware, Version 3.08\n\nAcuvim IIR\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NET Firmware, Version 3.08\nIMPACT\nThe authentication bypass vulnerability allows access to the settings on the Ethernet module web server interface without authenticating. A malicious user could create a denial-of-service condition for the power meter by changing the network settings.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccuenergy is a Canada-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and China.\nThe affected product, Acuvim II, is a multifunction power metering device. The AXM-NET Ethernet module creates a web page to display data produced by the Acuvim II. According to Accuenergy, Acuvim II is deployed in the Energy sector. Accuenergy estimates that this product is used primarily in North America and China.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE-592:Authentication Bypass Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html, web site last accessed April 14, 2016.\n\nBy accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL) on the web server, a malicious user is able to access settings without authenticating.\nCVE-2016-2293NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2293, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

It is available at:\nhttps://www.accuenergy.com/page/articles/protecting-your-modbus-tcp-ip-meter-from-security-risks\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
