EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds read, Use after free\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow information disclosure, remote code execution, or crash of the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DOPSoft, a Human Machine Interface (HMI) editing software, are affected:\n\nDOPSoft Version 4.00.06.15 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nProcessing a specially crafted project file may trigger multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities, which may allow information disclosure, remote code execution, or crash of the application.\nCVE-2019-13513 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nProcessing a specially crafted project file may trigger a use-after-free vulnerability, which may allow information disclosure, remote code execution, or crash of the application.\nCVE-2019-13514 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya of 9SG Security Team, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day (ZDI) Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends users apply the following mitigations:\n\nUpdate to the latest version of DOPSoft, Version 4.00.06.47\nRestrict interaction with the application to trusted files.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks. Specifically, users should:\n\nOnly use files from trusted sources on control systems equipment.\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
