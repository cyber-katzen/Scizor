RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities in CAMS server functions can be abused to suppress alarms, read or write files, crash the server, or execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nYokogawa reports these vulnerabilities affect the following distributed control system and software products:\u00a0\n\nCENTUM CS 3000 (Including CENTUM CS 3000 Entry Class): R3.08.10 - R3.09.00\nCENTUM VP (Including CENTUM VP Entry Class):\n\nR4.01.00 - R4.03.00\nR5.01.00 - R5.04.20\nR6.01.00 - R6.08.00\n\n\nExaopc: (R3.72.00 - R3.79.00)\n\nYokogawa reports the following products are not directly affected by the vulnerabilities, but may be indirectly affected by the existence of CENTUM installed on the same PC:\n\nB/M9000CS: (R5.04.01 - R5.05.01)\nB/M9000 VP: (R6.01.01 - R8.03.01)\n\nUsage of the CAMS function may determine whether an installation is affected.

A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nA malformed packet sent to a CAMS for HIS server may allow an attacker to achieve relative path traversal and then read and write files or execute commands.\nCVE-2022-21808 and CVE-2022-22729 have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER OUTPUT NEUTRALIZATION FOR LOGS CWE-117\nA malformed packet sent to a CAMS for HIS server may exploit an output neutralization vulnerability, allowing an attacker to crash the server or manipulate log files.\nCVE-2022-22151, CVE-2022-21177. and CVE-2022-22145 have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\nA local attacker may be able to utilize a named pipe with inappropriate access privileges to execute arbitrary programs.\nCVE-2022-22148 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264\nA local attacker may be able to utilize a named pipe with inappropriate access privileges to delete arbitrary files.\nCVE-2022-22141 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nCENTUM and Exaopc have a DLL injection vulnerability and a DLL planting vulnerability using the DLL search order vulnerability. See this link for further details on this exploit type.\nCVE-2022-23401 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJacob Baines from Dragos reported these vulnerabilities to Yokogawa.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nYokogawa recommends updating the following products:\n\nCENTUM VP: update to R6.09.00 or later\nExaopc: update to R3.80.00 or later\nCENTUM CS 3000: consider system upgrade to the latest revision of CENTUM VP\n\nThe method of obtaining and updating patch software depends on the support contract of each installation. Users who do not know how to obtain the update and install it should contact their service/sales person.\nPlease see Yokogawa\u2019s full report (YSAR-22-0001) for update details.\nFor questions related to this report, please contact Yokogawa security.\u00a0\nYokogawa also recommends the following countermeasures:\n\nFollow the installation instructions for each product and change the password of the OS account created when installing the product to an appropriate one.\nThe initial password is set by default for the predefined user accounts in CENTUM VP and Exaopc. Be sure to change the initial password.\nWhen changing the password, ensure that the same password is set in the entire system.\nFor more information about lists of the predefined user accounts in CENTUM VP and how to change the password for a user account, refer to: \"CENTUM VP Security Guide\"\n\nYokogawa strongly recommends users establish and maintain a full security program. Security program components include patch updates, anti-virus, backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewalls, etc.\u00a0\nYokogawa can assist in setting up and running security programs. For considering the most effective risk mitigation plan, as a starting point, Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment.\nFor questions related to this report, please contact Yokogawa.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
