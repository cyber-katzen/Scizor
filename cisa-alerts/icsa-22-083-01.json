MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Yokogawa recommends updating the following products:\n \n\n\n* CENTUM VP: update to R6\\.09\\.00 or later\n* Exaopc: update to R3\\.80\\.00 or later\n* CENTUM CS 3000: consider system upgrade to the latest revision of CENTUM VP\n\n\n\n The method of obtaining and updating patch software depends on the support contract of each installation. Users who do not know how to obtain the update and install it should contact their service/sales person.\n \n\n\n\n Please see Yokogawa\u2019s full report (\n [YSAR\\-22\\-0001](https://web-material3.yokogawa.com/1/32094/files/YSAR-22-0001-E.pdf) \n ) for update details.\n \n\n\n\n For questions related to this report, please contact\n [Yokogawa security](https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c-id=000498) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Yokogawa also recommends the following countermeasures:\n \n\n\n* Follow the installation instructions for each product and change the password of the OS account created when installing the product to an appropriate one.\n* The initial password is set by default for the predefined user accounts in CENTUM VP and Exaopc. Be sure to change the initial password.\n* When changing the password, ensure that the same password is set in the entire system.\n* For more information about lists of the predefined user accounts in CENTUM VP and how to change the password for a user account, refer to: \"CENTUM VP Security Guide\"\n\n\n\n Yokogawa strongly recommends users establish and maintain a full security program. Security program components include patch updates, anti\\-virus, backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewalls, etc.\n \n\n\n\n Yokogawa can assist in setting up and running security programs. For considering the most effective risk mitigation plan, as a starting point, Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment.\n \n\n\n\n For questions related to this report, please\n [contact Yokogawa](https://contact.yokogawa.com/cs/gw?c-id=000498) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) \n .
