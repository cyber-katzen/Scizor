The following provides links to instructions for addressing software that is at potential risk for the vulnerabilities:\n\nPowerSCADA Anywhere Version 1 used with PowerSCADA Expert v8.2 and PowerSCADA Expert v8.1: Uninstall PowerSCADA Anywhere (from Add/Remove Programs). Then install PowerSCADA Anywhere Version 1.1 available in the following location:\n\nhttps://schneider-electric.box.com/shared/static/3tvcc115kax8volhd8i13e4wg5k1sdel.iso\n\nCitect Anywhere version 1.1:\n\nhttps://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/scada/citectscada/downloads-updates/product-downloads?tab=extra_products\nIn addition to installing the provided security patch, Schneider Electric recommends that the following steps be taken to further harden the system:\n\nConfigure the HTTP origin header whitelist to match the environment\u2019s URL(s) used for accessing the secure gateway. This address may be one or more of the IP, machine name, or domain name where the secure gateway is hosted. The address may also be that of a load balancer or proxy, if the secure gateway is deployed that way.\nConfigure the secure gateway\u2019s whitelists to restrict access to expected client IPs, as well as to restrict access from the secure gateway to only expected internal server hosts. For an additional defense-in-depth layer, users can further use the Windows OS-level firewall (or zone firewalls) to restrict communication among only the expected nodes.\nIf using self-signed certificates, configure the secure gateway machine to trust the server certificate.\nDepending on the organization\u2019s requirements, users can further configure the secure gateway to restrict the usable TLS protocols. For an additional defense-in-depth layer, TLS protocols and cipher suites can also be restricted at the operating system level through the use of third party tools such as IISCrypto.\nCreate unique user accounts with minimal privileges dedicated to accessing applications remotely. OS group policy objects can be used to further restrict what those unique user accounts are allowed to do. For an example configuration that disables task manager from being launched in a remote app connection, follow the steps available here:\n\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/35dd3cd6-cc67-476f-82e2-058293e6f657/how-do-i-disable-task-manager-for-users-only?forum=winserverTS\nFor more information about the vulnerabilities and patch in PowerSCADA Anywhere, please refer to Schneider Electric Security Notification \u2013 PowerSCADA Anywhere SEVD-2017-173-01, which is available at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-173-01/\nFor more information about the vulnerabilities and patch in Citect Anywhere, please refer to Schneider Electric Security Notification \u2013 Citect Anywhere, which is available at the following location:\nhttps://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/safety-and-security-notifications/36-security-notifications/9071-security-notification-citect-anywhere\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\n\nThe secure gateway component of the affected products is vulnerable to CSRF for multiple state-changing requests. This type of attack requires some level of social engineering in order to get a legitimate user to click on or access a malicious link/site containing the CSRF attack.\nCVE-2017-7969 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n\nINFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\n\nAn attacker on an adjacent network may be able to specify arbitrary server target nodes in connection requests to the secure gateway and server components.\nCVE-2017-7970 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n\nIMPROPER VALIDATION OF CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION CWE-298\n\nThe affected products use outdated cipher suites and improperly verify peer SSL certificates.\nCVE-2017-7971 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF EXPRESSION/COMMAND DELIMITERS CWE-146\n\nAn attacker on an adjacent network may be able to escape out of remote applications and launch other processes.\nCVE-2017-7972 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\nRESEARCHER\nSchneider Electric notified ICS-CERT of these vulnerabilities after they made the fixes available.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Commercial Facilities\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Paris, France\n",
