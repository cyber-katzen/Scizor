EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.3*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  ABB* **Equipment:**  Relion 650 and 670 Series* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to reboot the device, causing a denial of service.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Relion, a protection and control device, are affected:* Relion 650 series versions 1\\.3\\.0\\.5 and prior* Relion 670 series versions 1\\.2\\.3\\.18 and prior* Relion 670 series versions 2\\.0\\.0\\.11 and prior* Relion 670 series versions 2\\.1\\.0\\.1 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) An attacker may use a specially crafted message to force the device to reboot, which could cause a denial of service.[CVE\\-2019\\-18247](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-18247)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Ilya Karpov, Evgeniy Druzhinin, and Victor Nikitin of ScadaX reported this vulnerability to ABB.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- ABB recommends that users apply the following or later versions at the earliest convenience:* Relion 650 series version 1\\.3\\.0\\.6* Relion 670 series version 1\\.2\\.3\\.19* Relion 670 series version 2\\.0\\.0\\.12* Relion 670 series version 2\\.1\\.0\\.2 Updates can be ordered by email at: [sa.t\\-supportline@se.abb.com](mailto:sa.t-supportline@se.abb.com)  ABB also recommends that these and other proper security practices and firewall configurations be implemented to help protect a process control network from attacks originating outside the network:* Process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Process control systems have no direct connections to the Internet.* Process control systems are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports/services exposed.* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. More information on recommended practices can be found in the ABB Cybersecurity Deployment Guidelines for each product version. ABB has not identified any workaround; however, firewall rules could be set to block incoming traffic to Port 7001/TCP that originate from outside the network. In the Relion 650 series Version 1\\.3, the SPA protocol over TCP/IP could be disabled if it is not in use.
