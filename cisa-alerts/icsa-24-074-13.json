EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Softing\nEquipment: edgeConnector\nVulnerabilities: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could create conditions that may allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Softing edgeConnector are affected:\n\nSofting edgeConnector: Version 3.60\nSofting edgeAggregator: Version 3.60\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE-22\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an absolute path traversal vulnerability, which may allow an attacker with admin privileges to write to a file or overwrite a file in the filesystem.\nCVE-2023-38126\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to capture packets to craft their own requests.\nCVE-2024-0860\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPan ZhenPeng (@Peterpan0927) and Li JianTao (@CurseRed) of STAR Labs SG Pte. Ltd. (@starlabs_sg) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. Claroty Team82 working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUpdate Softing edgeConnector and edgeAggregator to v3.70 or greater\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nMarch 14, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
