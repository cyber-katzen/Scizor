RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could create conditions that may allow remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Softing edgeConnector are affected:* Softing edgeConnector: Version 3\\.60* Softing edgeAggregator: Version 3\\.60### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to an absolute path traversal vulnerability, which may allow an attacker with admin privileges to write to a file or overwrite a file in the filesystem.[CVE\\-2023\\-38126](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38126)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)** The affected product is vulnerable to a cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to capture packets to craft their own requests.[CVE\\-2024\\-0860](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-0860)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 8\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Pan ZhenPeng (@Peterpan0927\\) and Li JianTao (@CurseRed) of STAR Labs SG Pte. Ltd. (@starlabs\\_sg) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. Claroty Team82 working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Update Softing edgeConnector and edgeAggregator to v3\\.70 or greater CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
