EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 4.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits available\nVendor: Uniview\nEquipment: NVR301-04S2-P4\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nAn attacker could send a user a URL that if clicked on could execute malicious JavaScript in their browser.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of Uniview NVR, a network video recorder, is affected:\n\nNVR301-04S2-P4: Versions prior to NVR-B3801.20.17.240507\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attack (XSS). An attacker could send a user a URL that if clicked on could execute malicious JavaScript in their browser. This vulnerability also requires authentication before it can be exploited, so the scope and severity is limited. Also, even if JavaScript is executed, no additional benefits are obtained.\nCVE-2024-3850 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-3850. A base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: China\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public Proof of Concept (PoC) as authored by Bleron Rrustemi and reported it to Uniview.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUniview encourages users to obtain the fixed version, Uniview NVR-B3801.20.17.240507, and update. You may contact your local dealer, Uniview Service Hotline, or regional technical support for assistance.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n5.
