EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIPROTEC 5 relays\nVulnerabilities: Classic Buffer Overflow\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-257-10 Siemens SIPROTEC 5 relays that was published September 14, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or trigger a remote code execution.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n---------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nThe following versions of SIPROTEC 5 relays are affected:\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP050: All versions prior to 8.80\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP100: All versions prior to 8.80\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP300: All versions prior to 8.80\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT (\u2018CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nAn attacker can send specially crafted packets to Port 4443/TCP, which may cause a denial-of-service condition or a remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-33719 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner from Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the following products:\n\nSIPROTEC 5 relays with CPU variants CP050, CP100, or CP300: Update to v8.80 or later.\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nBlock access to Port 4443/TCP, such as with an external firewall.\n\nSiemens notes operators of critical power systems (e.g., TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. Therefore, Siemens recommends the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid\u2019s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision, by trained staff, of the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN) and advises to configure the environment according to their operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nAdditional information on security guidelines for Digital Grid Products can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity\nPlease see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-847986 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
