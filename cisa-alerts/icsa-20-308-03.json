EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ARC Informatique\nEquipment: PcVue\nVulnerabilities: Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method, Information Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-20-308-03 ARC Informatique PcVue that was published November 3, 2020, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, expose sensitive data, and prevent legitimate users from connecting to PcVue services.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PcVue are affected:\n\nPcVue Versions 8.10 to versions prior to 12.0.17\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nThe affected product is vulnerable due to the deserialization of untrusted data, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the web and mobile back-end server.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-26867 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS TO CRITICAL PRIVATE VARIABLE VIA PUBLIC METHOD CWE-767\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to the ability of an unauthorized user to modify information used to validate messages sent by legitimate web clients. This issue also affects third-party systems based on the Web Services Toolkit.\nCVE-2020-26868 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nThe affected product is vulnerable to information exposure, allowing unauthorized users to access session data of legitimate users. This issue also affects third-party systems based on the Web Services Toolkit.\nCVE-2020-26869 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSergey Temnikov and Andrey Muravitsky of Kaspersky Lab reported these vulnerabilities to ARC Informatique.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nARC Informatique recommends upgrading PcVue to v12.0.17. Contact PcVue Support to receive instructions on downloading and installing the latest software version.\nPatches are available for Version 12 (12.0.17 Maintenance Release) and Version 11.2 (11.2.06097 Update).\nThe following mitigations and workarounds have been identified by ARC Informatique to help reduce risk:\n\nUninstall the web and mobile backend. Users not using the affected components should uninstall them. If the components are not required, do not install them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nHarden firewall configuration by ensuring that incoming connections on the corresponding port are authorized only if initiated by the IIS Web Server process. The listening port is configurable (default 8090) and may have been changed on the system using the Application Explorer.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------\nFor more information on this issue, please see Security Bulletin 2020-1 on the ARC Informatique security page.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
