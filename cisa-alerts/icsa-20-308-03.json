MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  ARC Informatique recommends upgrading PcVue to v12\\.0\\.17\\. Contact [PcVue Support](https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/index.php/support-request-en?view=form)  to receive instructions on downloading and installing the latest software version. Patches are available for Version 12 (12\\.0\\.17 Maintenance Release) and Version 11\\.2 (11\\.2\\.06097 Update). The following mitigations and workarounds have been identified by ARC Informatique to help reduce risk:* Uninstall the web and mobile backend. Users not using the affected components should uninstall them. If the components are not required, do not install them.* Harden firewall configuration by ensuring that incoming connections on the corresponding port are authorized only if initiated by the IIS Web Server process. The listening port is configurable (default 8090\\) and may have been changed on the system using the Application Explorer.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For more information on this issue, please see Security Bulletin 2020\\-1 on the [ARC Informatique security page](https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/security/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
