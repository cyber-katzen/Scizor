Sensys Networks has produced updated product versions that mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nThe Sensys Networks traffic sensors, VSN240-F and VSN240-T, operating with the following software versions are affected:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Versions prior to VDS 2.10.1,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Versions prior to VDS 1.8.8, and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Versions prior to TrafficDOT 2.10.3\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nIMPACT\nInsufficient integrity checking by the traffic sensors may enable the installation of modified software that could damage the traffic sensors. A traffic sensor that has been rendered inoperable may cause the traffic system to default to a failsafe condition, prompting traffic lights of an intersection to operate on predetermined timed intervals. Only the traffic lights that are linked to compromised sensors may be impacted.\nUnencrypted communication between the traffic sensor and the access point could be modified and used to cause traffic collection data inaccuracies, which may have limited impact on traffic control for an intersection. Inaccurate collection of traffic data may yield limited influence over traffic light timing for an intersection.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSensys Networks is a US-based company that supplies wireless traffic detection and integrated traffic data systems.\nThe affected products, Sensys Networks VSN240-F and VSN240-T traffic sensors, are wireless vehicle detection sensors. According to Sensys Networks, these products are deployed primarily in the United States and in multiple countries around the world.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nDOWNLOAD OF CODE WITHOUT INTEGRITY CHECKCWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html, web site last accessed September 04, 2014.\n\nThe traffic sensors accept software modifications without sufficiently checking the integrity of the new code, leaving the devices vulnerable to modification and damage.\nCVE-2014-2378NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2378, web site last accessed October 28, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:P, web site last accessed September 04, 2014.\n\nMISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATACWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html, web site last accessed September 04, 2014.\n\nUnencrypted wireless traffic between a traffic sensor and an access point could be intercepted and replayed to influence traffic data, which could have a limited impact on traffic control for an intersection.\nCVE-2014-2379NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2379, web site last accessed October 28, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, web site last accessed September 04, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\nEXPLOITABILITY\n\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited from an adjacent network.\n\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n\nDIFFICULTY\n\nAn attacker with a high skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSensys Networks has produced updated product versions VDS 2.10.1 and TrafficDOT 2.10.3 to remediate vulnerabilities identified in their VSN240-F and VSN240-T traffic sensors.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nSensys Networks has released software update VDS 1.8.8, for an older model access point, to remediate traffic sensor vulnerabilities.\nThe updated human-machine interface version, TrafficDOT 2.10.3, enables encrypted software downloads for sensors and sensor data authentication for access points and access point controller cards using updated versions VDS 2.10.1 or VDS 1.8.8.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\nAdditional information about Sensys Networks\u2019 software releases can be found at the following location:\nhttp://www.sensysnetworks.com/resources-by-category/#sw\nUpdated product versions are available through Sensys Networks\u2019 local distributors. Contact information for their local distributors can be found at the following location:\nhttp://www.sensysnetworks.com/distributors/\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
