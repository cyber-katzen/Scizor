UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-102-04 Mitsubishi Electric GT25-WLAN that was published April 12, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nThere are multiple vulnerabilities due to design flaws in the frame fragmentation functionality and the frame aggregation functionality in the Wireless Communication Standards IEEE 802.11. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal communication contents or inject unauthorized packets.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Wireless LAN communication unit GT25-WLAN in GOT2000 Series GT25 or GT27, are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nGT25-WLAN: Version 01.39.000 and earlier\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER REMOVAL OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION BEFORE STORAGE OR TRANSFER CWE-212\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a fragment cache attack as it does not clear fragments from memory when (re)connecting. This may allow an attacker to steal communication contents or inject unauthorized packets.\nCVE-2020-24586 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a mixed key attack as it reassembles fragments encrypted under different keys. This may allow an attacker to steal communication contents.\nCVE-2020-24587 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an aggregation attack as it accepts non-SPP A-MSDU frames. This may allow an attacker to inject unauthorized packets.\nCVE-2020-24588 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS IN OUTPUT USED BY A DOWNSTREAM COMPONENT ('INJECTION') CWE-74\nThe affected product can accept plaintext data frames in a protected network. This may allow an attacker to inject unauthorized packets.\nCVE-2020-26140 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected product is vulnerable to accepting fragmented plaintext data frames in a protected network. This may allow an attacker to inject unauthorized packets.\nCVE-2020-26143 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected product can accept plaintext A-MSDU frames that start with an RFC1042 header with EtherType EAPOL in an encrypted network. This may allow an attacker to inject unauthorized packets.\nCVE-2020-26144 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected product can reassemble encrypted fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. This may allow an attacker to steal communication contents.\nCVE-2020-26146 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMitsubishi Electric reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric has provided the following mitigations or workarounds.\n-------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor users who use the affected products and versions, please update to the fixed versions by following the steps:\nCheck the versions in use by referencing GOT2000 Series User's Manual (Utility) (SH-081195ENG), 6.9 Package Data Management \u2013 \u201cProperty operation.\u201d\nThe latest version of the manual is available from Mitsubishi Electric FA Global Website.\nFixed versions\nInstall system applications (extended function) \u201cWireless LAN\u201d v01.45.000 or later.\n\nFixed system applications (extended function) \u201cWireless LAN\u201d is included in GT Designer3 Version 1 (GOT2000) v1.275M or later.\nThis does not include countermeasures for CVE-2020-26146\n\nUsers are encouraged to follow the following update procedure:\n\nDownload and install the fixed version of MELSOFT GT Designer3 (GOT2000). Please contact a Mitsubishi Electric representative about MELSOFT GT Designer3 (GOT2000).\nStart the MELSOFT GT Designer3 (GOT2000) and open the project data used in affected products.\nSelect [Write to GOT] from [Communication] menu to write the required package data to the GOT. Please refer to \u201c4. COMMUNICATING WITH GOT\u201d in the GT Designer3 (GOT2000) Screen Design Manual (SH-081220ENG).\nAfter writing the required package data to the GOT, refer to the \u201cHow to check the versions in use\u201d and check the fixed versions.\n\n-------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nWhen using the wireless LAN communication unit as an access point, check if the wireless LAN communication unit settings are as follows.\n\nFor the passphrase used for wireless LAN, avoid settings that can be guessed from the consecutive numbers and MAC address, and set an unpredictable passphrase combining letters and numbers.\nUse WPA or WPA2 as the security authentication method for wireless LAN.\nUse the IP filter function*1 to restrict the accessible IP addresses.\n\n*1- Refer to GT Designer3 (GOT2000) Screen Design Manual (SH-081220ENG) \u201c5.4.3 Setting the IP filter\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen using the wireless LAN communication unit as a station, check if the router settings are as follows:\n\nFor the passphrase used for wireless LAN, avoid settings that can be guessed from the consecutive numbers and MAC address, and set an unpredictable passphrase combining letters and numbers.\nUse WPA or WPA2 as the security authentication method for wireless LAN.\nIf you change the router settings, hide its presence on the Internet to make it difficult for unauthorized access. (e.g., set to not respond to PING requests).\nSet password for the router\u2019s Management portal, which is difficult to be identified.\n\nCheck the following when using a computer or tablet, etc., on the same network.\n\nUpdate Antivirus software to the latest version.\nDo not open or access suspicious attachment file or linked URL.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
