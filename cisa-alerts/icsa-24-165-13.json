RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition, disclose sensitive information, or modify files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSINEC Traffic Analyzer (6GK8822-1BG01-0BA0): Versions prior to V1.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nNGINX Open Source before versions 1.23.2 and 1.22.1, NGINX Open Source Subscription before versions R2 P1 and R1 P1, and NGINX Plus before versions R27 P1 and R26 P1 have a vulnerability in the module ngx_http_mp4_module that might allow a local attacker to cause a worker process crash, or might result in worker process memory disclosure by using a specially crafted audio or video file. The issue affects only NGINX products that are built with the module ngx_http_mp4_module, when the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger processing of a specially crafted audio or video file with the module ngx_http_mp4_module.\nCVE-2022-41742 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2 INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATION CWE-613\nThe affected application does not expire the session. This could allow an attacker to get unauthorized access.\nCVE-2024-35206 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-35206.

MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSINEC Traffic Analyzer (6GK8822-1BG01-0BA0): Update to V1.2 or later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-196737 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
