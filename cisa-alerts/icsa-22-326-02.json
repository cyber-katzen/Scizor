EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 4.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\u00a0\nVendor: Digital Alert Systems\u00a0\nEquipment: DASDEC\u00a0\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities might result in false alerts being issued to broadcast or cable sites that are immediately connected to the compromised system.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DASDEC, an emergency communication system, are affected:\u00a0\n\nVersions prior to 4.1 (CVE-2019-18265 only)\u00a0\nAll versions (CVE-2022-40204 only)\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\u00a0\nDigital Alert Systems\u2019 DASDEC software prior to version 4.1 contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability where remote attackers could inject arbitrary web script or HTML code via the username field of the login page or the HTTP host header. The injected content is stored in logs and rendered when viewed in the web application.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-18265 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\u00a0\nAffected versions of Digital Alert Systems\u2019 DASDEC software contain a XSS vulnerability via the Host Header in undisclosed pages after login.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-40204 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Communications, Emergency Services\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKen Pyle reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDigital Alert Systems recommends users update systems to the latest version. CVE-2019-18265 has been patched as of Version 4.1, CVE-2022-40204 will be fixed in a future patch.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
