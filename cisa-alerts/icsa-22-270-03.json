RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the software crashing; a buffer overflow condition may allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following versions of ThinManager ThinServer, a thin client and remote desktop protocol (RDP) server management software:\u00a0\n\nVersions 11.0.0 through 11.0.4\nVersions 11.1.0 through 11.1.4\nVersions 11.2.0 through 11.2.5\nVersions 12.0.0 through 12.0.2\nVersions 12.1.0 through 12.1.3\nVersion 13.0.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could send a specifically crafted TFTP or HTTPS request, causing a heap-based buffer overflow that crashes the ThinServer process. This could expose the server to arbitrary remote code execution.\nCVE-2022-38742 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nrgod, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation and CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users update their products to the latest patched versions:\n\nVersions 11.0.0 through 11.0.4: Update to Version 11.00.05\nVersions 11.1.0 through 11.1.4: Update to Version 11.01.05\nVersions 11.2.0 through 11.2.5: Update to Version 11.02.06\nVersions 12.0.0 through 12.0.2: Update to Version 12.00.03\nVersions 12.1.0 through 12.1.3: Update to Version 12.01.04\nVersion 13.0.0: Update to Version 13.00.01\n\nRockwell Automation recommends users unable to update to the patched versions to block network access to the ThinManager TFTP and HTTPS ports from endpoints other than ThinManager managed thin clients.\nUsers can access security best practices at Rockwell Automation\u2019s Knowledgebase article, QA43240 Security Best Practices.\nFor more information, users should see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory (login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
