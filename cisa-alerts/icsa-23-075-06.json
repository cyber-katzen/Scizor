MITIGATIONS--------------- Honeywell recommends users upgrade OneWireless WDM to release R322\\.2\\. Download information includes the following:* Product: OneWireless* Version: 322\\.2* For instructions on this process:\t+ Go to the\t [Honeywell Website](https://process.honeywell.com/ \"Honeywell\") \t and sign in.\t+ Select \u201cSupport\u201d at the top of the web page\t+ Select \u201cProduct Documents \\& Downloads.\u201d\t+ In the given search box, search for: \u201cOneWireless R322\\.2\u201d or, after logging in, select the hyperlink: \u201cOneWireless R322\\.2\\.\u201d Honeywell advises users to ensure OneWireless security best practices are followed on the network to which the OneWireless WDM is attached to ensure access is limited to authorized users only. Users should ensure the backup files are maintained in a network location or physical drive with access limited to authorized users only and should not share them. The recommended network installation guidelines are available in the Honeywell guide, \"Network\\-Planning\\-and\\-Installation\\-Guide\\-OWDOC\\-X253\\-en\\-322\\.\" For access, users should visit the [Honeywell website](https://process.honeywell.com/ \"Honeywell Website\")  and sign in, select \u201cSupport\u201d at the top of the web page, then select \u201cProduct Documents \\& Downloads.\u201d In the given search box, search for: \u201cNetwork\\-Planning\\-and\\-Installation\\-Guide\\-OWDOC\\-X253\\-en\\-322\u201d or, after logging in, select the hyperlink: Network\\-Planning\\-and\\-Installation\\-Guide\\-OWDOC\\-X253\\-en\\-322\\. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.
