EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Commend\nEquipment: WS203VICM\nVulnerabilities: Argument Injection, Improper Access Control, Weak Encoding for Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information or force the system to restart.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nCommend reports that the following versions of WS203VICM video door station are affected:\n\nWS203VICM: version 1.7 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0ARGUMENT INJECTION CWE-88\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to send crafted messages to the web server of the Commend WS203VICM causing the system to restart, interrupting service.\nCVE-2024-22182\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nA remote attacker may be able to bypass access control of Commend WS203VICM by creating a malicious request.\nCVE-2024-21767\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0WEAK ENCODING FOR PASSWORD CWE-261\nA weak encoding is used to transmit credentials for WS203VICM.\nCVE-2024-23492\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities Sector\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Austria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez of S21sec reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAlthough this is an end-of-life product, Commend has created new firmware\u00a0version WS-CM 2.0\u00a0to address the first two issues. The new firmware can be loaded via the program \"IP Station Config\". To install the firmware, follow the instructions below:\n\nLog in to the Commend web-portal.\nDownload and extract the \"Terminals Software Package\".\nIn \"IP Station Config\", select the stations to be updated in the table.\nGo to: Menu Station > Firmware Download\nSelect the file \"WS-CM 2.0.geh\" from the folder \"WS-CM\" and click on the button Open.\n\nFor additional information, please visit\u00a0CSA-2024-42 on Commend's cybersecurity website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
