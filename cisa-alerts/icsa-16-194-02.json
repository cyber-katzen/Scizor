GE produced a new version to mitigate this vulnerability in August 2014.\nExploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY versions are affected:\n\nCIMPLICITY Version 8.2, SIM 26 or earlier.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an authenticated user on the system to modify the configuration of the CIMPLICITY service and launch any executable on the system as a service.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGE is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected product, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY, is a Client/Server-based human-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) application. According to GE, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY is deployed across several sectors.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENTCWE-269: Improper Privilege Management, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html, web site last accessed July 12, 2016.\n\nVulnerable versions may allow users to modify the CIMPLICITY service to edit the configuration of a service.\nCVE-2016-5787NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5787, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed July 12, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads a malicious file.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept a malicious file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nIn response to a recent public disclosure of proof-of-concept exploit code, GE has released a notification to its users of the identified vulnerability in an older version of the Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY application, along with the mitigation. GE\u2019s notification is available at the following location:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Article/GE-Digital-Security-Advisory-GED-16-01\nIn August 2014, GE released a new version of Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY, Version 8.2, Sim 27 that mitigated the identified vulnerability, which is available at the following location with a valid account:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/CIMPLICITY-8-2-SIM-27-DN\nGE recommends that users upgrade to Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY, Version 8.2, SIM 27 or later versions. The latest version of CIMPLICITY Version 8.2 SIM 43, is available at the following location, with a valid account:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/CIMPLICITY-8-2-SIM-43\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed July 12, 2016. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed July 12, 2016. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
