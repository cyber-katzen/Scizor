This could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2\\.4\\.54 and earlier.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2006\\-20001](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2006-20001) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.2\n [INCORRECT TYPE CONVERSION OR CAST CWE\\-704](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/704.html) \n\n\n\n\n A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non\\-binary bases, when using int(\"text\"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from\\_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-10735](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-10735) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.3\n [IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE\\-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html) \n\n\n\n\n A flaw was found in libdnf's signature verification functionality in versions before 0\\.60\\.1\\. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and then trick a user or system into installing it. The highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-3445](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-3445) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.4\n [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) \n\n\n\n\n An out\\-of\\-bounds memory access flaw was found in the ATI VGA device emulation of QEMU. This flaw occurs in the ati\\_2d\\_blt() routine while handling MMIO write operations when the guest provides invalid values for the destination display parameters. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-3638](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-3638) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.5\n [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) \n\n\n\n\n A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode\\_init\\_owner() function logic of the Linux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file\\-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE\\-2018\\-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-4037](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-4037) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.6\n [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html) \n\n\n\n\n An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020\\.81\\. It is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor due to a non\\-RFC\\-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client\\-side SSH code. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH\\-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-36369](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-36369) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.10\n [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE\\-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html) \n\n\n\n\n There is a vulnerability in the way the state file is created in logrotate. The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world\\-readable permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw affects logrotate versions before 3\\.20\\.0\\.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1348](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1348) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value. Once the fix is applied, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original query parameters unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-2880](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2880) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube\\-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube\\-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation could allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the API server's private network.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-3294](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3294) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

These attributes can be defined by adding a\u00a0.gitattributes file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted\u00a0.gitattributes file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023\\-01\\-17, going back to v2\\.30\\.7\\. Users are advised to upgrade.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a \\= {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12\\. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1\\.21\\.
