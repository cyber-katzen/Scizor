[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryEaton Intelligent Power Manager=============================== Last Revised May 10, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-130\\-041\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.2*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Eaton* **Equipment:**  Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) v1* **Vulnerability:**  Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code using untrusted data.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Eaton IPM, a power management platform, are affected:* Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) v1: All versions prior to v1\\.70### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) The affected product is vulnerable to a reflected cross\\-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient validation of input from certain resources by the IPM software. An attacker would need access to the local subnet and an administrator interaction to compromise the system.[CVE\\-2021\\-23282](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-23282)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Eaton recommends users upgrade to the latest version of Intelligent Power Manager:* Eaton IPM: [Update to v1\\.70](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/digital/brightlayer/brightlayer-data-centers-suite/disaster-avoidance-software.html) Eaton recommends users follow the security best practices and configure the logical access mechanisms provided in IPM to safeguard the application from unauthorized access. IPM provides various types of administrative, operational, and configuration privilege levels. Use the available access control mechanisms properly to ensure system and application access is restricted to legitimate users only. Ensure users are restricted to only the privilege levels necessary to complete their job roles/functions.* Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.* Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.* Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need\\-to\\-use basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), updated to the most current version available.* Regularly update software and applications to the latest versions available, as applicable.* Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.* Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g., SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.* Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes).* Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or passphrases.* Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.\u00a0CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
