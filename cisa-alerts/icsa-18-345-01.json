RISK EVALUATION------------------- These files can be executed to compromise the HMI, and by extension, the drive system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens has analyzed the vulnerability and has determined this vulnerability applies to the following HMIs:* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR32 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger)* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR42 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger)* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR52 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR325 (High Availability)* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR32 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger) where the HMI is operating under Microsoft Windows XP* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR42 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger) where the HMI is operating under Microsoft Windows XP* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR52 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger) where the HMI is operating under Microsoft Windows XP* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR325 (High Availability) where the HMI is operating under Microsoft Windows XP.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** HMIs with this vulnerability can be compromised via local attack using removable USB storage devices to transfer malicious files. The executable files from a hard drive solidified by MACC (McAfee Application and Change Control) can be executed on the system that did not generate the inventory.[CVE\\-2018\\-6690](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-6690)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER McAfee reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- McAfee has issued Security Bulletin SB10250 to address this vulnerability in MACC. SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives with HMIs produced between November 4, 2015 and October 9, 2018, use MACC as part of their software package, if option A30 was part of the order. For compatibility reasons, Siemens advises the installation of MACC 8\\.2\\.0 instead of Version 8\\.0\\.0, hotfix 5 as mentioned in SB10250\\. For the following products, Siemens recommends users upgrade to MACC v8\\.2\\.0 or greater using recommendations from McAfee to fix the vulnerability.* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR32 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger)* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR42 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger)* SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives: Serial numbers beginning MLFB 6SR52 with option A30 (HMIs 12 inch or larger) The update can be located here:[https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page\\=content\\&id\\=SB10250](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10250)  For the remaining products, and until updates can be applied, Siemens recommends the following workarounds to reduce risk: For the remaining products, and until updates can be applied, Siemens recommends the following workarounds to reduce risk:* Protect local access to the drive.* Ensure USB based storage media is blank and malware free before connecting to the drive.* Apply cell protection concept and implement defense\\-in\\-depth. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: [https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  ), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
