A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\nThe \u201cReports\u201d tab of the Fleet Management Console is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks when new reports are created or edited.\nCVE-2022-27494 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\nThe \u201cLoad\u201d tab of the Fleet Management Console is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attacks.\nCVE-2022-1059 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: East Asia, United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Singapore\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAsher Brass and Daniel Brodie of Cynerio reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAethon has implemented a mitigation plan to address these vulnerabilities. Aethon has checked all locations where this product is in use to ensure firewalls are active and to update systems to the newest software (Version 24).\u00a0\nFor more information about these issues and the associated mitigation practices, please contact Aethon.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
