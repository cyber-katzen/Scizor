EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: System Data Manager \u2013 SDM600\nVulnerabilities: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, Reachable Assertion, Type Confusion, Uncontrolled Recursion, Observable Discrepancy\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on traffic or to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nHitachi Energy reports these vulnerabilities affect the following System Data Manager products:\u00a0\n\nAll System Data Manager \u2013 SDM600 versions prior to version 1.2 FP2 HF10 (Build Nr. 1.2.14002.506)\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OBSERVABLE DISCREPANCY CWE-203\nIn affected OpenSSL versions, the Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification that can lead to an attacker computing the pre-master secret in connections that have used a Diffie-Hellman-based ciphersuite. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection.\nCVE-2020-1968 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RECURSION CWE-674\nIn affected versions of OpenLDAP, LDAP search filters with nested boolean expressions can result in a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-12243 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nA flaw in affected versions of the OpenLDAP slapd server may cause an assertion failure when processing a malicious packet. This may lead to a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-25709 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nA flaw in affected versions of OpenLDAP allows an attacker who sends a malicious packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23() function. This may lead to a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-25710 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0TYPE CONFUSION CWE-843\nA flaw was discovered in ldap_X509dn2bv in affected OpenLDAP versions leading to a slapd crash in the X.509 DN parsing in ad_keystring, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-36229 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REACHABLE ASSERTION CWE-617\nA flaw was discovered in affected OpenLDAP versions leading in an assertion failure in slapd in the X.509 DN parsing in decode.c ber_next_element, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-36230 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190\nA flaw in affected versions of OpenSSL may cause calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate to overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissible length for an integer on the platform. This could lead to applications behaving incorrectly.\nCVE-2021-23840 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe vulnerabilities are remediated as of the following product Version SDM600 Version 1.2 FP2 HF10 (Build Nr. 1.2.14002.506). Hitachi Energy recommends users apply the update at the earliest convenience from the SDM600 product website.\nHitachi Energy also recommends the following general security mitigations:\n\nImplement and continuously revise least privileges principles to minimize permissions and accesses to SDM600 related resources.\nFollow security practices as defined in SDM600 security deployment guideline and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are:\u00a0\n\nPhysically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\nNot directly connected to the Internet.\nSeparated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.\nNot used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails.\n\n\nCarefully scan portable computers and removable storage media for viruses before connecting to a control system.\n\nFor additional information, see the Hitachi Energy security advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
