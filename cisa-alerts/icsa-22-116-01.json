MITIGATIONS--------------- The vulnerabilities are remediated as of the following product Version SDM600 Version 1\\.2 FP2 HF10 (Build Nr. 1\\.2\\.14002\\.506\\). Hitachi Energy recommends users apply the update at the earliest convenience from the [SDM600 product website](https://www.hitachiabb-powergrids.com/ch/en/offering/product-and-system/scada/microscada-x/sdm600)  . Hitachi Energy also recommends the following general security mitigations:* Implement and continuously revise least privileges principles to minimize permissions and accesses to SDM600 related resources.* Follow security practices as defined in SDM600 security deployment guideline and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are:\t+ Physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\t+ Not directly connected to the Internet.\t+ Separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.\t+ Not used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails.* Carefully scan portable computers and removable storage media for viruses before connecting to a control system. For additional information, see the Hitachi Energy [security advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000074&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
