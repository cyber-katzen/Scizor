Analysts confirmed that nation\\-state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited\n [CVE\\-2022\\-47966](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47966 \"CVE-2022-47966\") \n to gain unauthorized access to a public\\-facing application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus), establish persistence, and move laterally through the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution on the ManageEngine application. Additional APT actors were also observed exploiting\n [CVE\\-2022\\-42475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42475 \"CVE-2022-42475\") \n to establish presence on the organization\u2019s firewall device.\n \n\n\n\n CISA and co\\-sealers are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to provide network defenders with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), IOCs, and methods to detect and protect against similar exploitation.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-250A Actors Exploit CVE\\-2022\\-47966 and CVE\\-2022\\-42475](/sites/default/files/2023-09/aa23-250a-apt-actors-exploit-cve-2022-47966-and-cve-2022-42475_1.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 681\\.49 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-250A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2023-09/AA23-250A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 69\\.24 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-250A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2023-09/AA23-250A%20Multiple%20Nation-State%20Threat%20Actors%20Exploit%20CVE-2022-47966%20and%20CVE-2022-42475.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 69\\.89 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of the Malware Analysis Report (MAR) accompanying this CSA, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[MAR\\-10430311\\-1\\.v1 Multiple Nation\\-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE\\-2022\\-47966 and CVE\\-2022\\-42475](/sites/default/files/2023-09/MAR-10430311.c1.v1.CLEAR_.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 385\\.49 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\u00ae for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 13\\. See Tables 3\\-13 for the APT actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations.\n \n\n\n#### **Overview**\n\n\n\n By request of the impacted organization, CISA conducted an incident response engagement from February to April 2023\\. CISA and co\\-sealers assess that beginning as early as January 2023, multiple nation\\-state APT actors were present on the organization\u2019s network via at least two initial access vectors:\n \n\n\n* **Initial Access Vector 1:** \n APT actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-47966 to access the organization\u2019s web server hosting the public\\-facing application, Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus.\n* **Initial Access Vector 2:** \n APT actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-42475 to access the organization\u2019s firewall device.\n\n\n\n CISA and co\\-sealers identified an array of threat actor activity, to include overlapping TTPs across multiple APT actors. Per the activity conducted, APT actors often scan internet\\-facing devices for vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited. Firewall, virtual private networks (VPNs), and other edge network infrastructure continue to be of interest to malicious cyber actors. When targeted, they can be leveraged to expand targeted network access, serve as malicious infrastructure, or a mixture of both.\n \n\n\n#### **APT Actor Activity**\n\n\n##### *Initial Access Vector 1*\n\n\n\n As early as January 2023, APT actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-47966 \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ] for initial access to the organization\u2019s web server hosting the public\\-facing application, Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. CISA observed indications in log files that a connection to the known malicious IP address\n `192.142.226[.]153` \n was made as part of initial exploitation.\n \n\n\n\n Through exploitation of CVE\\-2022\\-47966, APT actors achieved root level access on the web server and created a local user account \\[\n [T1136\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1136/001/ \"Create Account: Local Account\") \n ] named\n `Azure` \n with administrative privileges \\[\n [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1068/ \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\") \n ]. Actors were further able to download malware, enumerate the network, collect administrative user credentials, and move laterally through the organization\u2019s network. CISA and co\\-sealers were unable to determine if proprietary information was accessed, altered, or exfiltrated. This was due to the organization not clearly defining where their data was centrally located and CISA having limited network sensor coverage.\n \n\n\n##### *Initial Access Vector 2*\n\n\n\n Additional APT actors exploited CVE\\-2022\\-42475 on the organization\u2019s firewall device, which was indicated by multiple successful VPN connections from known\\-malicious IPs between February 1\\-16, 2023\\. It was identified that APT actors compromised and used disabled, legitimate administrative account credentials \\[\n [T1078\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1078/003/ \"Valid Accounts: Local Accounts\") \n ] from a previously hired contractor\u2014of which the organization confirmed the user had been disabled prior to the observed activity.\n \n\n\n\n Analysis identified that a common behavior for these threat actors was to use disabled administrative account credentials and delete logs from several critical servers in the environment \\[\n [T1070\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1070/001/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\") \n ]. This prevented the ability to detect follow\\-on exploitation or data exfiltration. CISA and co\\-sealers were also unable to further track the activity due to the organization not having Network Address Translation (NAT) IP logging enabled.\n \n\n\n\n APT actors initiated multiple Transport Layer Security (TLS)\\-encrypted sessions \\[\n [T1573\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1573/002/) \n ] on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10443 \\[\n [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1571/) \n ], indicating successful exchanges of data transfer from the firewall device. APT actors were observed connecting to the device from the following actor\\-controlled C2 IP addresses:\n \n\n\n* `144.202.2[.]71`\n* `207.246.105[.]240`\n* `45.77.121[.]232`\n* `47.90.240[.]218`\n\n\n\n APT actors further leveraged legitimate credentials to move from the firewall to a web server, where multiple web shells were loaded\u2014among other locations, such as the OWA server\u2014into the following directories.\n **Note:** \n The following file paths to these web shells were received in coordination with a trusted third\\-party; however, the artifacts were not received for analysis.\n \n\n\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\resource.aspx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[REDACTED]\\css\\font-awesome\\css\\discover.ashx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[REDACTED]\\css\\font-awesome\\css\\configlogin.ashx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\15\\template\\layouts\\approveinfo.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\infos.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\errorinfo.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\infos.ashx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\error.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\infos.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\info.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\info-1.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\new_list.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\errorinfo.aspx`\n* `c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Web Apps\\RootWebsite\\en-us\\lgnbotr.ashx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\passwordchange\\0LECPNJYRH.aspx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\passwordchange\\9ehj.aspx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\wss\\VirtualDirectories\\Portal80\\_vti_pvt\\servicesinfo.ashx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\wss\\VirtualDirectories\\Portal80\\_vti_pvt\\services.aspx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\redirectedSites\\[REDACTED]\\products\\uns1fw.aspx`\n* `c:\\inetpub\\redirectedSites\\[REDACTED]\\products\\uns1ew.aspx`\n\n\n\n The following IP addresses were identified as associated with the loaded web shells:\n \n\n\n* `45.90.123[.]194`\n* `154.6.91[.]26`\n* `154.6.93[.]22`\n* `154.6.93[.]5`\n* `154.6.93[.]12`\n* `154.6.93[.]32`\n* `154.6.93[.]24`\n* `184.170.241[.]27`\n* `191.96.106[.]40`\n* `102.129.145[.]232`\n\n\n##### *Forensic Timeline of APT Actor Activity*\n\n\n\n Tables 1 and 2 list the timeline of events discovered during the incident response, as well as tools used by the APT actors to conduct their operations, respectively.

Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 3\\-13\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n CISA and co\\-sealers recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [NIST: NVD CVE\\-2022\\-47966](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47966 \"CVE-2022-47966\")\n* [NIST: NVD CVE\\-2022\\-42475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42475 \"CVE-2022-42475\")\n* [CISA: KEV List](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")\n* [MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise v13\\.1](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\")\n* [CISA, MITRE: Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Mapping\")\n* [CISA: Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\")\n* [CISA: Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")\n* [CISA: Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/cyber-hygiene-services \"Cyber Resource Hub\")\n* [CISA: Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet\\-Accessible Systems](/sites/default/files/publications/CISAInsights-Cyber-RemediateVulnerabilitiesforInternetAccessibleSystems_S508C.pdf \"Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet-Accessible Systems\")\n* [CISA: Layering Network Security Through Segmentation](/sites/default/files/publications/layering-network-security-segmentation_infographic_508_0.pdf \"Layering Network Security Through Segmentation\")\n* [NSA: Segment Networks and Deploy Application\\-Aware Defenses](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180325/-1/-1/0/Segment%20Networks%20and%20Deploy%20Application%20Aware%20Defenses%20-%20Copy.pdf \"Segment Networks and Deploy Application-Aware Defenses\")\n* [CISA: MFA](https://www.cisa.gov/MFA \"More than a Password\")\n* [CISA: Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA](/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\")\n* [Microsoft: Using Security Baselines in Your Organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-configuration-framework/windows-security-baselines \"Security baselines\")\n* [CISA: Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\")\n* [Microsoft: Best Practices for Securing Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/best-practices-for-securing-active-directory \"Best Practices for Securing Active Directory\")\n* [NSA: Network Infrastructure Security Guide](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/2949885/nsa-details-network-infrastructure-best-practices/ \"NSA Details Network Infrastructure Best Practices\")\n\n\n### **DISCLAIMER**\n\n\n\n The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
