Trend Link software.\nResearcher Kuang-Chun Hung of Security Research and Service Institute\u2212Information and Communication Security Technology Center (ICST) has identified an insecure ActiveX control method vulnerability in Canary Labs, Inc. Trend Link ActiveX control. Canary Labs, Inc. has updated Trend Link, and Kuang-Chun Hung has tested the patch and verified that it mitigates the vulnerability. If exploited, an attacker could influence the paths or file names that are used in the software application. This could affect systems using Trend Link in the critical manufacturing and energy sectors in the United States, South America, and Europe.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAffected Products\nCanary Lab, Inc. reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products:\n\nTrend Link Versions 9.0.2.27051 and prior.\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploit of this vulnerability could result in a denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nCanary Labs, Inc. is a US-based company that has products deployed in 24 countries, including the United States, South America, and Europe.\nThe affected product, Trend Link,Canary Labs, Inc. Trend Link, http://www.canarylabs.com/software/canary-trend-link, Web site last accessed April 08, 2013. is a trending application that can be used in SCADA systems. According to Canary Labs, Inc., these products are deployed across several sectors including the critical manufacturing and energy sectors.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nInsecure ActiveX Control MethodCWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html, Web site last accessed April 08, 2013.\nTrend Link uses an ActiveX control that contains an insecure ActiveX control method. This control is loaded from \u201cTrendDisplay.dll,\u201d and contains a method called \u201cSaveToFile\u201d that allows users to save arbitrary files to any location on the server hosting the control. This vulnerability could result in a DoS or allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2012-3022NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3022, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:C), Web site last accessed April 08, 2013.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with medium skill could exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\nCanary Labs, Inc. has published a customer notification concerning this vulnerability.\u00a0 Trend Link customers who wish to obtain the update and instructions on how to apply it should contact Canary Labs product support:\nCanary Labs Product SupportCanary Labs Product Support, http://www.canarylabs.com/services-and-support/product-support, Web site last accessed April 08, 2013.814-793-3770support@canarylabs.com\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html, Web site last accessed April 08, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B.pdf, Web site last accessed April 08, 2013.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
