Hospira identified vulnerabilities in the Symbiq Infusion System. Kyle Kamke of Ramparts, LLC has identified an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Hospira\u2019s Symbiq Infusion System. NCCIC/ICS-CERT is reporting on these vulnerabilities to notify healthcare providers of a coordinated disclosure of vulnerability information and to provide additional defensive measures to help mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities. Hospira is releasing the Plum 360 Infusion System, a new version of Plum\u00a0A+.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target some of these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Hospira products are affected:\n\nPlum A+ Infusion System, Version 13.4 and prior versions,\nPlum A+3 Infusion System, Version 13.6 and prior versions, and\nSymbiq Infusion System,As previously announced by Hospira in 2013, the Symbiq Infusion System was retired by Hospira on May 31, 2015 and will be fully removed from the market by December 2015. According to Hospira, during a recent service visit, the remaining Symbiq Infusion Systems have had Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET closed. Version 3.13 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, in a worst case scenario, may allow an attacker to impact the core functions of the device.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nHospira is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected products, the Plum A+ Infusion System (which includes Plum A+ and the Plum\u00a0A+3 Infusion System), are intravenous pumps that deliver medication to patients. The affected products are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health Sector. Hospira estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed June 10, 2015.\n\nThe researcher has evaluated the device and asserts that the device contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be exploited to allow execution of arbitrary code on the device. This vulnerability has not been validated by Hospira. However, acting out of an abundance of caution, ICS-CERT is including this information to enhance healthcare providers\u2019 awareness, so that additional monitoring and controls can be applied.\nCVE-2015-3955NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3955, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

In addition, Hospira is also releasing its Plum 360 Infusion System. Hospira asserts that the Plum 360 uses a different architecture than the Plum A+ Infusion System and is not vulnerable to the reported vulnerabilities.\nFor additional information about the vulnerabilities and compensating measures, contact Hospira\u2019s technical support at 1-800-241-4002.\nICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners to perform a risk assessment by examining their specific clinical use of the affected products in their host environment to identify any potential impacts of the identified vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT offers the following compensating options:\n\nTemporarily disconnect the affected product from the wireless network until unused ports on the device are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET. Once the unused ports have been closed, reconnecting the affected device to the wireless network should be done after ensuring that the host network is isolated from the Internet. The affected product should be isolated from untrusted systems; traffic to the device should be selectively controlled and monitored for anomalous activity.\nDisconnect the affected product from the wireless network and use a wired connection to the host network. The operational concerns associated with this option are primarily associated with the initial setup of the wired connection and verifying that the host network effectively implements good design practices prior to connection of the affected product.\nIf neither of the previous two options are feasible, then disconnect the affected product from the wireless network until mitigations are available. Disconnecting the affected product from the wireless network will have operational impacts. Disconnecting the device will require drug libraries to be updated manually and data normally transmitted to MedNet from the device, will not be available. Manual updates to each pump can be labor intensive and prone to entry error.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to implement the following defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure that unused ports are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET. \nHospira strongly recommends that healthcare providers change the default password used to access Port 8443.\nMonitor and log all network traffic attempting to reach the affected product via Port 20/FTP, Port 23/TELNET and Port 8443.\nUse good design practices that include network segmentation. Use DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems to identify anomalous activity. Use the static nature of these isolated environments to look for anomalous activities.\nMaintain layered physical and logical security to implement defense-in-depth security practices for environments operating medical devices.\nIsolate all medical devices from the Internet and untrusted systems.\nProduce an MD5 checksum of key files to identify any unauthorized changes.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
