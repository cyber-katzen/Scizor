RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports that the following SIMATIC mobile RFID reader products are affected:\n \n\n\n* SIMATIC RF160B (6GT2003\\-0FA00\\): versions prior to V2\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) \n\n\n\n\n An attacker could cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted DNS responses to the DNSmasq process. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to trigger DNS requests from the device and must be in a privileged position to inject malicious DNS responses.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-14491](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-14491) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.2\n [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) \n\n\n\n\n An issue was discovered in net/ipv6/ip6mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4\\.11\\. By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause an inet\\_csk\\_listen\\_stop general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances. The issue can be triggered as root (e.g., inside a default LXC container or with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability) or after namespace unsharing. This occurs because sk\\_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6\\_mroute\\_\\* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4\\.9\\.x longterm kernels before 4\\.9\\.187\\.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-18509](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-18509) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.4\n [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE\\-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html) \n\n\n\n\n In setNiNotification of GpsNetInitiatedHandler.java, there is a possible permissions bypass due to an empty mutable PendingIntent. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android\\-10, Android\\-8\\.1, Android\\-9 Android ID: A\\-154319182\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-0417](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-0417) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n 3\\.2\\.5\n [EXPECTED BEHAVIOR VIOLATION CWE\\-440](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/440.html) \n\n\n\n\n A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5\\.8\\-rc1 in the prctl() function, where it can be used to enable indirect branch speculation after it has been disabled. This call incorrectly reports it as being 'force disabled' when it is not and opens the system to Spectre v2 attacks.

This flaw allows an unauthenticated remote user to crash the system, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-14305](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14305) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This flaw allows a local attacker to corrupt system memory or escalate their privileges when creating a futex on a filesystem that is about to be unmounted. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-14381](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14381) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-770721 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-770721.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-770721.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n .
