MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released a new version (V2\\.2\\) for SIMATIC RF160B and recommends users update to the latest version. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-770721 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-770721.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-770721.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
