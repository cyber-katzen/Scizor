EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Advantech\nEquipment: WebAccess/SCADA\u00a0\nVulnerability: External Control of File Name or Path\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute remote code as an administrator.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of WebAccess/SCADA, a browser-based SCADA software package, are affected:\n\nWebAccess/SCADA Versions 9.0 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXTERNAL CONTROL OF FILE NAME OR PATH CWE-73\nThe WADashboard component of WebAccess/SCADA may allow an attacker to control or influence a path used in an operation on the filesystem and remotely execute code as an administrator.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-25161 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: East Asia, Europe, United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSivathmican Sivakumaran of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAdvantech recommends users update to Version 9.0.1 or later.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
