EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.9*** **ATTENTION:**  Low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SIMATIC S7\\-300 and S7\\-400 CPUs* **Vulnerability:**  Insufficiently Protected Credentials2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the advisory update titled ICSA\\-20\\-252\\-02 Siemens SIMATIC S7\\-300 and S7\\-400 CPUs (Update B) that was published November 10, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in credential disclosure.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports the vulnerability affects the following versions of SIMATIC S7\\-300 and S7\\-400 CPU families:* SIMATIC S7\\-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC S7\\-400 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions* SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010: All versions* SINUMERIK 840D sl: All versions### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-522](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html) The authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via Port 102/TCP (ISO\\-TSAP) insufficiently protects the transmitted password. This could allow an attacker that is able to intercept the network traffic to obtain valid PLC credentials.[CVE\\-2020\\-15791](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15791)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C\u00a0Part 1 of 1\u00a0\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Hyunguk Yoo from University of New Orleans, Irfan Ahmed and Adeen Ayub from Virginia Commonwealth University, Jongwon Choi from National Security Research Institute, and Taeshik Shon from Ajou University reported this vulnerability to Siemens.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End\u00a0Update C Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** 5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Apply [defense\\-in\\-depth concepts](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  .* Apply [cell protection concepts](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrialsecurity)  .* For SIMATIC S7\\-CPU 410 CPUs: Activate field interface security in PCS 7 v9\\.0, and use a CP443\\-1 Adv. to communicate with ES/OS As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
