EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.9\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC S7-300 and S7-400 CPUs\nVulnerability: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-20-252-02 Siemens SIMATIC S7-300 and S7-400 CPUs (Update B) that was published November 10, 2020, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in credential disclosure.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the vulnerability affects the following versions of SIMATIC S7-300 and S7-400 CPU families:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC S7-400 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants): All versions\nSIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010: All versions\nSINUMERIK 840D sl: All versions\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nThe authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via Port 102/TCP (ISO-TSAP) insufficiently protects the transmitted password. This could allow an attacker that is able to intercept the network traffic to obtain valid PLC credentials.\nCVE-2020-15791 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0(AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n--------- Begin Update C\u00a0Part 1 of 1\u00a0---------\u00a0\nHyunguk Yoo from University of New Orleans, Irfan Ahmed and Adeen Ayub from Virginia Commonwealth University, Jongwon Choi from National Security Research Institute, and Taeshik Shon from Ajou University reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n--------- End\u00a0Update C Part 1 of 1 ---------\u00a0\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nApply defense-in-depth concepts.\nApply cell protection concepts.\nFor SIMATIC S7-CPU 410 CPUs: Activate field interface security in PCS 7 v9.0, and use a CP443-1 Adv. to communicate with ES/OS\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFollow this link for additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens.\nFor more information on this vulnerability and the associated mitigations, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-381684\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable from adjacent networks.\n",
