EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Exacq Technologies, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc.\nEquipment: exacq Enterprise Manager\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to enter malicious input resulting in remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Exacq Technologies Enterprise Manager, an enterprise management tool, are affected:\n\nExacq Enterprise Manager: All Versions 21.12 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn attacker could enter malicious data into the affected product, causing remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-44228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls, Inc, reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends upgrading exacq Enterprise Manager to Version 21.12.1 or apply manual mitigation steps (available upon request).\nRefer to the exacq Hardening Guide for guidance on isolating exacqVision NVRs and Enterprise Manager from public facing networks to reduce network exposure to attacks.\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2021-24 v1\nFurther ICS security notices and product security guidance are located at Johnson Controls product security website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
