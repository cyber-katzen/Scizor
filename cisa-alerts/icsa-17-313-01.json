UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the updated advisory titled ICSA-17-313-01A AutomationDirect CLICK, C-More, C-More Micro, Do-more Designer, GS Drives, SL-Soft SOLO that was published March 20, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following AutomationDirect products are affected:\n\nCLICK Programming Software (Part Number C0-PGMSW) Versions 2.10 and prior,\nC-More Programming Software (Part Number EA9-PGMSW)\u00a0 Versions 6.30 and prior,\nC-More Micro (Part Number EA-PGMSW) Versions 4.20.01.0 and prior,\nDo-more Designer Software (Part Number DM-PGMSW) Versions 2.0.3 and prior,\nGS Drives Configuration Software (Part Number GSOFT) Versions 4.0.6 and prior, and\nSL-SOFT SOLO Temperature Controller Configuration Software (Part Number SL-SOFT) Versions 1.1.0.5 and prior.\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 3 --------\n\nDirectSOFT Programming Software Versions 6.1 and prior\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 3 --------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nAn uncontrolled search path element (DLL Hijacking) vulnerability has been identified. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could rename a malicious DLL to meet the criteria of the application, and the application would not verify that the DLL is correct. Once loaded by the application, the DLL could run malicious code at the privilege level of the application.\nCVE-2017-14020 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Cumming, Georgia\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMark Cross of RIoT Solutions reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nAutomationDirect has produced fixes for the following software:\n\nCLICK Programming Software: Version 2.11 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/clickplcs.html\n\nC-more Programming Software: Version 6.32\u00a0 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/cmore.html\n\nC-more Micro Programming Software:\u00a0 Version 4.21 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/cmoremicro.html\n\nDo-more Designer Software: Version 2.2.1 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/domore.html\n\nGS Drives: Version 4.0.7 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/gsoft.html\n\nSL-Soft SOLO Configuration software: Version 1.1.0.6\u00a0 available at:\n\nhttp://support.automationdirect.com/products/solo.html\n--------- Begin Update B Part 3 of 3 --------\n\nDirectSOFT: Versions 6.2 available at:\n\nhttps://support.automationdirect.com/products/directsoft.html\n--------- End Update B Part 3 of 3 --------\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
