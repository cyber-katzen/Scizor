EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.4\n\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Dr\u00e4ger\nEquipment: Infinity Delta\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Improper Input Validation, Information Exposure Through Log Files, Improper Privilege Management\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause information disclosure of device logs, denial of service through device reboots of the patient monitors, and privilege escalation.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Dr\u00e4ger patient monitoring medical devices are affected:\n\nInfinity Delta, all versions,\nDelta XL, all versions,\nKappa, all version, and\nInfinity Explorer C700, all versions.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA malformed network packet may cause the monitor to reboot. By repeatedly sending the malformed network packet, an attacker may be able to disrupt patient monitoring by causing the monitor to repeatedly reboot until it falls back to default configuration and loses network connectivity.\nCVE-2018-19010 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH LOG FILES CWE-532\nLog files are accessible over an unauthenticated network connection. By accessing the log files, an attacker is able to gain insights about internals of the patient monitor, the location of the monitor, and wired network configuration.\nCVE-2018-19014 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nVia a specific dialog it is possible to break out of the kiosk mode and reach the underlying operating system. By breaking out of the kiosk mode, an attacker is able to take control of the operating system.\nCVE-2018-19012 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMarc Ruef and Rocco Gagliardi, of scip AG, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDr\u00e4ger released fixes for these vulnerabilitiesin December 2018. Users can find Delta/Infinity Explorer VF10.1 software releases for affected components via Dr\u00e4ger ServiceConnect.\nDr\u00e4ger further advises:\n\nUsers are advised to review their network segmentation configuration. The Dr\u00e4ger Infinity-Network is supposed to be either logically or physically separate from the hospital LAN.\nUsers are advised to review the Windows patch level of their Infinity Explorer. The Infinity Explorer software is verified by Dr\u00e4ger on a monthly basis to be compatible to all latest operating system patches by Microsoft. Users can get the test report via their local sales representative.\n\nUsers can direct further questions related to the vulnerabilities to a designated regional marketing manager. For reporting incidents and potential vulnerabilities in Dr\u00e4ger devices, please refer to https://static.draeger.com/security to contact the Product Security team directly.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Dr\u00e4ger product security advisory 201802 at:\nhttps://static.draeger.com/security\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
