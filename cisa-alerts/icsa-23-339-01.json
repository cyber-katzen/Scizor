EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.4*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable with adjacent access/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Zebra Technologies* **Equipment**  : ZTC Industrial ZT410, ZTC Desktop GK420d* **Vulnerability**  : Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to send specially crafted packets to change credentials without any prior authentication.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Zebra ZTC industrial and desktop printers are affected:* ZTC Industrial ZT410: All versions* ZTC Desktop GK420d: All versions### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel CWE\\-288](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html)** A vulnerability of authentication bypass has been found in Zebra Technologies ZTC Industrial ZT410 and ZTC Desktop GK420d. This vulnerability allows an attacker that is in the same network as the printer to change the username and password for the web page by sending a specially crafted POST request to the setvarsResults.cgi file. For this vulnerability to be exploitable, the printer's protected mode must be disabled.[CVE\\-2023\\-4957](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-4957)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Phosphorus Cybersecurity reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Zebra printers running Link\\-OS v6\\.0 and later have a protected mode that protects the printer from this vulnerability. Activating this mode disables unauthorized changes and locks the current configuration until an administrator authorizes updates. By default, the secure mode is disabled as it is necessary to generate a password first. For more information about the protected mode and to apply it to Zebra printer products that may be affected, see the [Link\\-OS Printer Administration Guide](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra_new_ia/en-us/software-printer/utilities/en/admin-files/printsecure-administration-guide-en.pdf)  . NOTE: The ZT410 industrial printer was discontinued on Oct 1st, 2020\\. The service and support discontinuation dates are in September and December, 2025, depending on region. Further information regarding security settings and best practices, including \"Protected Mode,\" can be found in the references of the product. NOTE: the GK420d desktop printer was discontinued on Jan 31, 2022\\. The service and support discontinuation date is April 30, 2025\\. For more information on the product resources, see [GK420d Desktop Printer Support Manual](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printers/desktop/gk420d.html)  .
