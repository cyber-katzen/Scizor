EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable with adjacent access/low attack complexity\nVendor: Zebra Technologies\nEquipment: ZTC Industrial ZT410, ZTC Desktop GK420d\nVulnerability: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to send specially crafted packets to change credentials without any prior authentication.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Zebra ZTC industrial and desktop printers are affected:\n\nZTC Industrial ZT410: All versions\nZTC Desktop GK420d: All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel CWE-288\nA vulnerability of authentication bypass has been found in Zebra Technologies ZTC Industrial ZT410 and ZTC Desktop GK420d. This vulnerability allows an attacker that is in the same network as the printer to change the username and password for the web page by sending a specially crafted POST request to the setvarsResults.cgi file. For this vulnerability to be exploitable, the printer's protected mode must be disabled.\nCVE-2023-4957\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nPhosphorus Cybersecurity reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nZebra printers running Link-OS v6.0 and later have a protected mode that protects the printer from this vulnerability. Activating this mode disables unauthorized changes and locks the current configuration until an administrator authorizes updates. By default, the secure mode is disabled as it is necessary to generate a password first.\nFor more information about the protected mode and to apply it to Zebra printer products that may be affected, see the\u00a0Link-OS Printer Administration Guide.\nNOTE: The ZT410 industrial printer was discontinued on Oct 1st, 2020. The service and support discontinuation dates are in September and December, 2025, depending on region. Further information regarding security settings and best practices, including \"Protected Mode,\" can be found in the references of the product.\nNOTE: the GK420d desktop printer was discontinued on Jan 31, 2022. The service and support discontinuation date is April 30, 2025.\nFor more information on the product resources, see\u00a0GK420d Desktop Printer Support Manual.\nFor more information on this vulnerability, see INCIBE-CERT's\u00a0Security Advisory.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
