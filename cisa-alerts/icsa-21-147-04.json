RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution or information leakage.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products are affected:* JT2Go: All versions prior to v13\\.1\\.0\\.2* Teamcenter Visualization: All versions prior to v13\\.1\\.0\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) Affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information.[CVE\\-2020\\-26998](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26998)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) Affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing of PAR files. This could result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information.[CVE\\-2020\\-26999](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26999)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) Affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing of PAR files. This could result in a stack\\-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2020\\-27001](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27001)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) Affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to access data in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2020\\-27002](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27002)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  )#### 3\\.2\\.5 [UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-822](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/822.html) Affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing ASM files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from an untrusted source. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2020\\-26991](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26991)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael DePlante (@izobashi), Francis Provencher {PRL}, and rgod, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported four of these vulnerabilities to CISA. Carsten Eiram from Risk Based Security reported the fifth ( [CVE\\-2020\\-26991](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26991)  ) to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends the following:* JT2Go: Update to [v13\\.1\\.0\\.2](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html)  or later* Teamcenter Visualization: [Update to v13\\.1\\.0\\.2](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  or later (Login required)* Avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-695540](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-695540.pdf)  CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks.
