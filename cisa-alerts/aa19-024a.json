Using compromised credentials, an attacker can modify the location to which an organization\u2019s domain name resources resolve. This enables the attacker to redirect user traffic to attacker\\-controlled infrastructure and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization\u2019s domain names, enabling man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attacks.\n \n\n\n\n See the following links for downloadable copies of open\\-source\u00a0indicators of compromise\u00a0(IOCs) from the sources listed in the References section below:\n \n\n\n* [IOCs (.csv)](/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.csv)\n* [IOCs (.stix)](/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.stix.xml)\n\n\n\n Note: these files were last updated February 13, 2019, to remove the following three\u00a0non\\-malicious IP addresses:\n \n\n\n* 107\\.161\\.23\\.204\n* 192\\.161\\.187\\.200\n* 209\\.141\\.38\\.71\n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n Using the following techniques, attackers have redirected and intercepted web and mail traffic, and could do so for other networked services.\n \n\n\n1. The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through alternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records.\n2. Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name Server (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the attacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for manipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they choose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection.\n3. Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization\u2019s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be decrypted, exposing any user\\-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the domain, end users receive no error warnings.\n\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\n\n\n NCCIC recommends the following best practices to help safeguard networks against this threat:\n \n\n\n* Update the passwords for all accounts that can change organizations\u2019 DNS records.\n* Implement multifactor authentication on domain registrar accounts, or on other systems used to modify DNS records.\n* Audit public DNS records to verify they are resolving to the intended location.\n* Search for encryption certificates related to domains and revoke any fraudulently requested certificates.\n\n\n\n### References\n\n\n\n\n[Cisco Talos blog: DNSpionage Campaign Targets Middle East](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html) \n\n\n[CERT\\-OPMD blog: \\[DNSPIONAGE] \u2013 Focus on internal actions](https://blog-cert.opmd.fr/dnspionage-focus-on-internal-actions) \n\n\n[FireEye blog: Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html) \n\n\n[Crowdstrike blog: Widespread DNS Hijacking Activity Targets Multiple Sectors](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors) \n\n\n### Revisions\n\n\n\n\n January 24, 2019: Initial version\\|February 6, 2019: Updated IOCs, added Crowdstrike blog\\|February 13, 2019: Updated IOCs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa19-024a) \n ;
