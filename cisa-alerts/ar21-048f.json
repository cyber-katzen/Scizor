Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts among the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Treasury (Treasury) to highlight the cyber threat to cryptocurrency posed by North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and provide mitigation recommendations. Working with U.S. government partners, FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess that Lazarus Group\u2014which these agencies attribute to North Korean state\\-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors\u2014is targeting individuals and companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that have been modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency.       This MAR highlights this cyber threat posed by North Korea and provides detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on other versions of AppleJeus and recommended steps to mitigate this threat, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA21\\-048A: AppleJeus: Analysis of\u00a0North Korea's Cryptocurrency Malware at https://www.us\\-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA21\\-048A.       There have been multiple versions of AppleJeus malware discovered since its initial discovery in August 2018\\. In most versions, the malware appears to be from a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading company and website, whereby an unsuspecting individual downloads a third\\-party application from a website that appears legitimate.       The U.S. Government has identified AppleJeus malware version\u2014Dorusio\u2014and associated IOCs used by the North Korean government in AppleJeus operations. Some information has been redacted from this report to preserve victim anonymity.       Dorusio, discovered in March 2020, is a legitimate\\-looking cryptocurrency trading software that is marketed and distributed by a company and website\u2014 Dorusio Wallet and dorusio\\[.]com, respectively\u2014that appear legitimate. There are Windows and OSX versions of Dorusio Wallet. As of at least early 2020, the actual download links result in 404 errors. The download page has release notes with version revisions claiming to start with Version 1\\.0\\.0, which was released on April 15, 2019\\.     For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:  [MAR\\-10322463\\-6\\.v1\\.stix](/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10322463-6.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)   .

The service is installed with a description of \u201cAutomatic Dorusio Upgrade.\"       After installing the service, \"DorusioUpgrade.exe\" has similar behavior to the upgrade components of Kupay Wallet (AppleJeus variant 4\\) and CoinGoTrade (AppleJeus variant 5\\). On startup, \"DorusioUpgrade.exe\" allocates memory in order to later write a file. After allocating the memory and storing the hardcoded string \u201cLatest\u201d in a variable, the program attempts to open a network connection. The connection is named \u201cDorusio Wallet 2\\.1\\.0 (Check Update Windows)\u201d, likely to avoid suspicion from a user.       Similar to previous AppleJeus variants, \"DorusioUpgrade.exe\" collects some basic information from the system as well as a timestamp and places them in hard\\-coded format strings. Specifically, the timestamp is placed into a format string \u201cver\\=%d\\&timestamp\\=%lu\u201d where ver is set as the 201000, possibly referring to the Dorusio Wallet version previously mentioned (Figure 5\\).       This basic information and hard\\-coded strings are sent via a POST to the command and control (C2\\) \"dorusio.com/dorusio\\_update.php.\" If the POST is successful (i.e. returns an HTTP response status code of 200\\) but fails any of multiple different checks, \"DorusioUpgrade.exe\" will sleep for two minutes and then regenerate the timestamp and contact the C2 again.       After receiving the payload from the C2, the program writes the payload to memory and executes the payload.       The payload could not be downloaded as the C2 server dorusio.com/dorusio\\_update.php is no longer accessible. In addition, the sample was not identified in open source reporting for this sample.

The OSX program does not has a digital signature and will warn the user of that before installation. As all previous versions of AppleJeus, the Dorusio Wallet installer appears to be legitimate, and installs both \u201cDorusio\u201d (a0c461c94ba9f1573c7253666d218b3343d24bfa5d8ef270ee9bc74b7856e492\\) in the \u201c/Applications/Dorusio.app/Contents/MacOS/\u201d folder and a program named \"dorusio\\_upgrade\" (dcb232409c799f6ddfe4bc0566161c2d0b372db6095a0018e6059e34c2b79c61\\) also in the \u201c/Applications/Dorusio.app/Contents/MacOS/\u201d folder. The installer contains a postinstall script (Figure 7\\).       The postinstall script is identical in functionality to the postinstall scripts from previous AppleJeus variants and is identical to the CoinGoTrade (version 5\\) postinstall script. The postinstall script creates a \u201cDorusioDaemon\u201d folder in the OSX \u201c/Library/Application Support\u201d folder and moves \"dorusio\\_upgrade\" to it. The \u201cApplication Support\u201d folder contains both system and third\\-party support files which are necessary for program operation. Typically, the subfolders have names matching those of the actual applications. At installation, Dorusio placed the plist file (com.dorusio.pkg.wallet.plist) in \u201c/Library/LaunchDaemons/.\"       As the LaunchDaemon will not be run immediately after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script then launches the dorusio\\_upgrade program in the background.

If it is a 0, the program sleeps again, and if it is a 1, the function \u201cCheckUpdate\u201d is called. This function contains most of the logic functionality of the malware. \"CheckUpdate\" sends a POST to the C2 hxxps\\[:]//dorusio.com/dorusio\\_update.php with a connection named \u201cDorusio Wallet 2\\.1\\.0 (Check Update Osx).       Just as the Kupay and CoinGoTrade malware, the timestamp is placed into a format string \u201cver\\=%d\\&timestamp\\=%ld\u201d where ver is set as the 20100, possibly referring to the Dorusio Wallet version previously mentioned.       If the C2 server returns a file, it is decoded and written to /private/tmp/dorusio\\_update,\" with permissions by the command \"chmod 700\" (only the user can read, write, and execute). The stage2 (/private/tmp/dorusio\\_update) is then launched and the malware dorusio\\_upgrade returns to sleeping and checking in with the C2\\.       The payload could not be downloaded as the C2 server dorusio.com/dorusio\\_update.php is no longer accessible. In addition, the sample was not identified in open source reporting for this sample.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
