EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS7\nVulnerability: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-19-192-02 Siemens SIMATIC WinCC and PCS7 (Update B) that was published September 10, 2019, on the ICS webpage of us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected service or device.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens industrial products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v8.0: all versions\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v8.1: all versions prior to v8.1 with WinCC v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v8.2: all versions prior to v8.2 SP1 with WinCC v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v9.0: all versions prior to v9.0 SP2 with WinCC v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC Professional (TIA Portal v13): all versions\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC WinCC Professional (TIA Portal v14): all versions prior to v14 SP1 Upd 9\nSIMATIC WinCC Professional (TIA Portal v15): all versions prior to v15.1 Upd 3\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v14: all versions prior to v14.1 Upd 8\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v15: all versions prior to v15.1 Upd 3\n\n--------- End Update C Part 1 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.2 and earlier: all versions\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.3: all versions prior to v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.4: all versions prior to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.5: all versions prior to v7.5 Upd 3\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThe SIMATIC WinCC DataMonitor web application of the affected products allows an authenticated user with network access to the WinCC DataMonitor application to upload arbitrary ASPX code.\nSuccessful exploitation requires no user interaction and may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device. The vulnerability is relevant only in situations where an attacker has access via the web interface but not to the directory structure.\nCVE-2019-10935 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nXuchen Zhu from ZheJiang Guoli Security Technology and CNCERT/CC reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens currently has updates for the following products:\n\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v8.1: Update WinCC to v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v8.2: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC PCS 7 v9.0: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.3: Update WinCC to v7.3 Upd 19\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.4: Update WinCC to v7.4 SP1 Upd 11\nSIMATIC WinCC v7.5: Update WinCC to v7.5 Upd 3\n\n--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional (TIA Portal v14): Update v14 SP1 Upd 9\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional (TIA Portal v15): Update v15.1 Upd 3\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v14: Update v14.1 Upd 8\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional v15: Update v15.1 Upd 3\n\n--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------\nFor the balance of the listed products, Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends users apply the following specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce risk until patches are available:\n\nApply defense in depth.\n\nSiemens recommends users configure their environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (Download) and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on the vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-121293 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
