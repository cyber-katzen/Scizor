For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.6\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens \u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Missing Authorization\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow authenticated remote attackers to perform unauthorized actions.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nSiemens RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW: All versions prior to V5.2\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862\u00a0\nThe client query handler of the affected application fails to check for proper permissions for specific write queries. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to perform unauthorized actions.\nCVE-2023-27309\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\u00a0\n3.2.2.\u00a0MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862\u00a0\nThe client query handler of the affected application fails to check for proper permissions when assigning groups to user accounts. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to assign administrative groups to otherwise non-privileged user accounts.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-27310\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workaround/mitigation users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nRUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW: Update to\u00a0V5.2\u00a0or later version.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines\u00a0for Industrial Security. Additional information on Siemens Industrial Security can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-260625 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
