EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Eaton\nEquipment: Intelligent Power Protector (IPP)\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code using untrusted data.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Eaton IPP, a power protection platform, are affected:\n\nEaton Intelligent Power Protector (IPP): All versions prior to v1.69 release 166\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user input and improper encoding of the output for certain resources within the IPP software.\nCVE-2021-23283 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEaton recommends users upgrade to the latest version of its software, Eaton IPP v1.69\nEaton recommends users follow the security best practices and configure the logical access mechanisms provided in IPP to safeguard the application from unauthorized access. Use the available access control mechanisms properly to ensure system and application access is restricted to legitimate users only. Ensure users are restricted to only the privilege levels necessary to complete their job roles/functions.\n\nRestrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not directly accessible from the Internet.\nDeploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.\nRemote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), updated to the most current version available.\nRegularly update software and applications to latest versions available, as applicable.\nEnable audit logs on all devices and applications.\nDisable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g., SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.\nCreate security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices (e.g., firewalls, data diodes).\nChange default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or passphrases.\nPerform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.\n\nFor additional information, please visit Eaton\u2019s cybersecurity website.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
