EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nVendor: Sensormatic Electronics, LLC., a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc.\nEquipment: KT-1\nVulnerability: Use of Unmaintained Third-party Components\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nThe affected product uses an unsupported version of Microsoft Windows CE. This version may not receive support and updates for potential vulnerabilities, which could put the affected product at risk.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of KT-1, an Ethernet-ready single-door controller, are affected:\n\nKT-1: Versions 2.09.02 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF UNMAINTAINED THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS CWE-1104\nThe affected product relies on Microsoft Windows CE 6.0 that is no longer supported. This may make it difficult to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJohnson Controls reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends the following:\n\nUpgrade KT-1 firmware to Version 3.02.01\nFor more detailed mitigation instructions see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2021-12\n\nFor more information Contact Johnson Controls Global Product Security by website or email.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
