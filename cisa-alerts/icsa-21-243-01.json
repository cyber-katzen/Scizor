EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **Vendor:**  Sensormatic Electronics, LLC., a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc.* **Equipment:**  KT\\-1* **Vulnerability:**  Use of Unmaintained Third\\-party Components2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- The affected product uses an unsupported version of Microsoft Windows CE. This version may not receive support and updates for potential vulnerabilities, which could put the affected product at risk.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of KT\\-1, an Ethernet\\-ready single\\-door controller, are affected:* KT\\-1: Versions 2\\.09\\.02 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF UNMAINTAINED THIRD\\-PARTY COMPONENTS CWE\\-1104](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1104.html) The affected product relies on [Microsoft Windows CE 6\\.0 that is no longer supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-embedded-ce-60)  . This may make it difficult to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Johnson Controls reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Johnson Controls recommends the following:* Upgrade KT\\-1 firmware to Version 3\\.02\\.01* For more detailed mitigation instructions see Johnson Controls Product Security Advisory [JCI\\-PSA\\-2021\\-12](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions/security-advisories) For more information Contact Johnson Controls Global Product Security by [website](http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions)  or [email](mailto:productsecurity@jci.com)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
