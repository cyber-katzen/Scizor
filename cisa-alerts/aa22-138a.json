This recently disclosed vulnerability in certain versions of F5 Networks, Inc., (F5\\) BIG\\-IP enables an unauthenticated actor to gain control of affected systems via the management port or self\\-IP addresses. F5 released a patch for CVE\\-2022\\-1388 on May 4, 2022, and proof of concept (POC) exploits have since been publicly released, enabling less sophisticated actors to exploit the vulnerability. Due to\n [previous exploitation of F5 BIG\\-IP vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-206a) \n , CISA and MS\\-ISAC assess unpatched F5 BIG\\-IP devices are an attractive target; organizations that have not applied the patch are vulnerable to actors taking control of their systems.\n \n\n\n\n According to public reporting, there is active exploitation of this vulnerability, and CISA and MS\\-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched F5 BIG\\-IP devices (mostly with publicly exposed management ports or self IPs) in both government and private sector networks. CISA and MS\\-ISAC strongly urge users and administrators to remain aware of the ramifications of exploitation and use the recommendations in this CSA\u2014including upgrading their software to fixed versions\u2014to help secure their organization\u2019s systems against malicious cyber operations. Additionally, CISA and MS\\-ISAC strongly encourage administrators to deploy the signatures included in this CSA to help determine whether their systems have been compromised. CISA and MS\\-ISAC especially encourage organizations who did not patch immediately or whose F5 BIG\\-IP device management interface has been exposed to the internet to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the detection signatures in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA.\n \n\n\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report (pdf, 500kb).](/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-138A-Threat_Actors_Exploiting_F5_BIG-IP_CVE-2022-1388_F5.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-1388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1388) \n is a critical iControl REST authentication bypass vulnerability affecting the following versions of F5 BIG\\-IP:\\[\n [1](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K23605346) \n ]\n \n\n\n* 16\\.1\\.x versions prior to 16\\.1\\.2\\.2\n* 15\\.1\\.x versions prior to 15\\.1\\.5\\.1\n* 14\\.1\\.x versions prior to 14\\.1\\.4\\.6\n* 13\\.1\\.x versions prior to 13\\.1\\.5\n* All 12\\.1\\.x and 11\\.6\\.x versions\n\n\n\n An unauthenticated actor with network access to the BIG\\-IP system through the management port or self IP addresses could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, or disable services. F5 released a patch for CVE\\-2022\\-1388 for all affected versions\u2014except 12\\.1\\.x and 11\\.6\\.x versions\u2014on May 4, 2022 (12\\.1\\.x and 11\\.6\\.x versions are end of life \\[EOL], and F5 has stated they will not release patches).\\[\n [2](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K11438344) \n ]\n \n\n\n\n POC exploits for this vulnerability have been publicly released, and on May 11, 2022, CISA added this vulnerability its\n [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n , based on evidence of active exploitation. Due to the POCs and ease of exploitation, CISA and MS\\-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched F5 BIG\\-IP devices in government and private networks.\n \n\n\n### Detection Methods\n\n\n\n CISA recommends administrators, especially of organizations who did not immediately patch, to:\n \n\n\n* See the F5 Security Advisory\n [K23605346](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K23605346) \n for indicators of compromise.\n* See the F5 guidance\n [K11438344](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K11438344) \n if you suspect a compromise.\n* Deploy the following CISA\\-created Snort signature:\n\n\n\n alert tcp any any \\-\\> any $HTTP\\_PORTS (msg:\u201dBIG\\-IP F5 iControl:HTTP POST URI \u2018/mgmt./tm/util/bash\u2019 and content data \u2018command\u2019 and \u2018utilCmdArgs\u2019:CVE\\-2022\\-1388\u201d; sid:1; rev:1; flow:established,to\\_server; flowbits:isnotset,bigip20221388\\.tagged; content:\u201dPOST\u201d; http\\_method; content:\u201d/mgmt/tm/util/bash\u201d; http\\_uri; content:\u201dcommand\u201d; http\\_client\\_body; content:\u201dutilCmdArgs\u201d; http\\_client\\_body; flowbits:set,bigip20221388\\.tagged; tag:session,10,packets; reference:cve\\-2022\\-1388; reference:url,github.com/alt3kx/CVE\\-2022\\-1388\\_PoC; priority:2; metadata:service http;)\n \n\n Additional resources to detect possible exploitation or compromise are identified below:\n \n\n\n* [Emerging Threats suricata signatures](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open-nogpl/suricata-4.0/emerging-all.rules) \n .\n **Note:** \n CISA and MS\\-ISAC have verified these signatures are successful in detection of both inbound exploitation attempts (SID: 2036546\\) as well as post exploitation, indicating code execution (SID: 2036547\\).\n\t+ SID 2036546\n\n\n\n alert http $HOME\\_NET any \\-\\> $EXTERNAL\\_NET any (msg:\"ET EXPLOIT F5 BIG\\-IP iControl REST Authentication Bypass (CVE 2022\\-1388\\) M1\"; flow:established,to\\_server; content:\"POST\"; http\\_method; content:\"/mgmt/tm/util/bash\"; http\\_uri; fast\\_pattern; content:\"Authorization\\|3a 20\\|Basic YWRtaW46\"; http\\_header; content:\"command\"; http\\_client\\_body; content:\"run\"; http\\_client\\_body; distance:0; content:\"utilCmdArgs\"; http\\_client\\_body; distance:0; http\\_connection; content:\"x\\-F5\\-Auth\\-Token\"; nocase; http\\_header\\_names; content:!\"Referer\"; content:\"X\\-F5\\-Auth\\-Token\"; flowbits:set,ET.F5AuthBypass; reference:cve,2022\\-1388; classtype:trojan\\-activity; sid:2036546; rev:2; metadata:attack\\_target Web\\_Server, created\\_at 2022\\_05\\_09, deployment Perimeter, deployment SSLDecrypt, former\\_category EXPLOIT, performance\\_impact Low, signature\\_severity Major, updated\\_at 2022\\_05\\_09;\n \n* SID SID 2036547\n\n\n\n alert http $HOME\\_NET any \\-\\> any any (msg:\"ET EXPLOIT F5 BIG\\-IP iControl REST Authentication Bypass Server Response (CVE 2022\\-1388\\)\"; flow:established,to\\_client; flowbits:isset,ET.F5AuthBypass; content:\"200\"; http\\_stat\\_code; file\\_data; content:\"kind\"; content:\"tm\\|3a\\|util\\|3a\\|bash\\|3a\\|runstate\"; fast\\_pattern; distance:0; content:\"command\"; distance:0; content:\"run\"; distance:0; content:\"utilCmdArgs\"; distance:0; content:\"commandResult\"; distance:0; reference:cve,2022\\-1388; classtype:trojan\\-activity; sid:2036547; rev:1; metadata:attack\\_target Web\\_Server, created\\_at 2022\\_05\\_09, deployment Perimeter, deployment SSLDecrypt, former\\_category EXPLOIT, performance\\_impact Low, signature\\_severity Major, updated\\_at 2022\\_05\\_09;)\n \n\n\n\n\n* [Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 Threat Brief: CVE\\-2022\\-1388](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2022-1388/) \n .

Limit access to the management interface to the fullest extent possible.\n5. Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.\n6. Report the compromise to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center (\n [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov) \n or 888\\-282\\-0870\\). State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to MS\\-ISAC (\n [SOC@cisecurity.org](mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org) \n or 866\\-787\\-4722\\).\n\n\n\n See the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on\n [Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a) \n for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA and MS\\-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see CISA\u2019s\n [Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf) \n .
