This recently disclosed vulnerability in certain versions of F5 Networks, Inc., (F5) BIG-IP enables an unauthenticated actor to gain control of affected systems via the management port or self-IP addresses. F5 released a patch for CVE-2022-1388 on May 4, 2022, and proof of concept (POC) exploits have since been publicly released, enabling less sophisticated actors to exploit the vulnerability. Due to previous exploitation of F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities, CISA and MS-ISAC assess unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices are an attractive target; organizations that have not applied the patch are vulnerable to actors taking control of their systems.\nAccording to public reporting, there is active exploitation of this vulnerability, and CISA and MS-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices (mostly with publicly exposed management ports or self IPs) in both government and private sector networks. CISA and MS-ISAC strongly urge users and administrators to remain aware of the ramifications of exploitation and use the recommendations in this CSA\u2014including upgrading their software to fixed versions\u2014to help secure their organization\u2019s systems against malicious cyber operations. Additionally, CISA and MS-ISAC strongly encourage administrators to deploy the signatures included in this CSA to help determine whether their systems have been compromised. CISA and MS-ISAC especially encourage organizations who did not patch immediately or whose F5 BIG-IP device management interface has been exposed to the internet to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the detection signatures in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA.\nDownload the PDF version of this report (pdf, 500kb).\n\nTechnical Details\n\nCVE-2022-1388 is a critical iControl REST authentication bypass vulnerability affecting the following versions of F5 BIG-IP:[1]\n\n16.1.x versions prior to 16.1.2.2\u00a0\n15.1.x versions prior to 15.1.5.1\u00a0\n14.1.x versions prior to 14.1.4.6\u00a0\n13.1.x versions prior to 13.1.5\u00a0\nAll 12.1.x and 11.6.x versions\n\nAn unauthenticated actor with network access to the BIG-IP system through the management port or self IP addresses could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, or disable services. F5 released a patch for CVE-2022-1388 for all affected versions\u2014except 12.1.x and 11.6.x versions\u2014on May 4, 2022 (12.1.x and 11.6.x versions are end of life [EOL], and F5 has stated they will not release patches).[2]\nPOC exploits for this vulnerability have been publicly released, and on May 11, 2022, CISA added this vulnerability its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. Due to the POCs and ease of exploitation, CISA and MS-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched F5 BIG-IP devices in government and private networks.\u00a0\nDetection Methods\nCISA recommends administrators, especially of organizations who did not immediately patch, to:\n\nSee the F5 Security Advisory K23605346 for indicators of compromise.\u00a0\nSee the F5 guidance K11438344 if you suspect a compromise.\u00a0\nDeploy the following CISA-created Snort signature:\n\nalert tcp any any -> any $HTTP_PORTS (msg:\u201dBIG-IP F5 iControl:HTTP POST URI \u2018/mgmt./tm/util/bash\u2019 and content data \u2018command\u2019 and \u2018utilCmdArgs\u2019:CVE-2022-1388\u201d; sid:1; rev:1; flow:established,to_server; flowbits:isnotset,bigip20221388.tagged; content:\u201dPOST\u201d; http_method; content:\u201d/mgmt/tm/util/bash\u201d; http_uri; content:\u201dcommand\u201d; http_client_body; content:\u201dutilCmdArgs\u201d; http_client_body; flowbits:set,bigip20221388.tagged; tag:session,10,packets; reference:cve-2022-1388; reference:url,github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2022-1388_PoC; priority:2; metadata:service http;)\nAdditional resources to detect possible exploitation or compromise are identified below:\n\nEmerging Threats suricata signatures.

State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to MS-ISAC (SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722).\n\nSee the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA and MS-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see CISA\u2019s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail steps for both incident and vulnerability response.\u00a0\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA and MS-ISAC recommend organizations:\n\nUpgrade F5 BIG-IP software to fixed versions; organizations using versions 12.1.x and 11.6.x should upgrade to supported versions.\u00a0\nIf unable to immediately patch, implement F5\u2019s temporary workarounds:\n\nBlock iControl REST access through the self IP address.\nBlock iControl REST access through the management interface.\nModify the BIG-IP httpd configuration.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSee F5 Security Advisory K23605346 for more information on how to implement the above workarounds.\u00a0\nCISA and MS-ISAC also recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk of compromise:\n\nMaintain and test an incident response plan.\nEnsure your organization has a vulnerability program in place and that it prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning. Note: CISA\u2019s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all SLTT organizations and public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations: https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services.\nProperly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.\n\nDo not expose management interfaces to the internet.\nDisable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.\nDisable/remove unused network services and devices.\n\n\nAdopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:\n\nMicro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.\nEnforcing multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN connections.\nRestricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] K23605346: BIG-IP iControl REST vulnerability CVE-2022-1388 \n[2] K11438344: Considerations and guidance when you suspect a security compromise on a BIG-IP system \n\nRevisions\n\nInitial Version: May 18, 2022\n",
