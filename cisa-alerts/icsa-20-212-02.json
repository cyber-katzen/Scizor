A CVSS v3 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks, the Applied Risk research team, and Mashav Sapir of Claroty reported this vulnerability to Mitsubishi Electric.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nMitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigations:\nDownload the latest version of each software product and update it, excluding the following products:\n\nEZSocket is a communication middleware product for Mitsubishi Electric partner companies. Mitsubishi Electric will directly provide the fixed version to the partner companies.\nDownload and update the latest FR Configurator2 fixed version.\n\n--------- Begin Update D Part 2 of 2---------\u00a0\n\nMitsubishi Electric recommends users migrate to the MELSEC iQ-R series MELSEC WinCPU module, which uses the settings tool CW Configurator (SW1DND-RCCPU-E). The settings tool for MELSEC-Q series WinCPU module, MELSEC WinCPU Setting Utility, will not receive a patched version.\n\n--------- End Update D Part 2 of 2---------\u00a0\nMitsubishi Electric has provided firmware updates for the following products to fix the vulnerability. Refer to the manual for update help.\u00a0See Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s security advisory for more details.\n\nCPU Module Logging Configuration Tool, Version 1.106K or later\nCW Configurator, Version 1.011M or later\nData Transfer, Version 3.41T or later\nEZSocket, Version 4.6 or later\nFR Configurator2, Version 1.23Z or later\nGT Designer3 Version1 (GOT2000), Version 1.236W or later\nGT SoftGOT1000 Version3, Version 3.245F or later\nGT SoftGOT2000 Version1, Version 1.236W or later\nGX LogViewer, Version 1.106K or later\nGX Works2, Version 1.595V or later\nGX Works3, Version 1.065T or later\nM_CommDTM-HART, Version 1.01B or later\nM_CommDTM-IO-Link, Versions 1.04E or later\u00a0\nMELFA-Works, Version 4.4 or later\nMELSOFT EM Software Development Kit (EM Configurator), Version 1.015R or later\nMELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator, Version 1.04E or later\nMELSOFT Navigator, Version 2.70Y or later\nMH11 SettingTool Version2, Version 2.003D or later\nMI Configurator, Version 1.005F or later\nMotorizer, Version 1.010L or later\nMR Configurator2, Version 1.106L or later\nMT Works2, Version 1.160S or later\nMX Component, Version 4.20W or later\nNetwork Interface Board CC IE Control utility, Version 1.30G or later\nNetwork Interface Board CC IE Field Utility, Version 1.17T or later\nNetwork Interface Board CC-Link Ver.2 Utility, Version 1.24A or later\nNetwork Interface Board MNETH utility, Version 35M or later\nPX Developer, Version 1.53F or later\nRT ToolBox2, Version 3.73B or later\nRT ToolBox3, Version 1.80J or later\nSetting/monitoring tools for the C Controller module (SW4PVC-CCPU), Version 4.13P or later\n\nFor users who are using a product that has not released a fixed version or who cannot immediately update the product, Mitsubishi Electric recommends taking the following mitigation measures to minimize risk:\n\nInstall the fixed version GX Works2, GX Works3, or MELSOFT Navigator on the PC on which the product is installed. This is because these three products provide comprehensive countermeasures that give the same countermeasure effect to other products installed in the same folder (e.g. C:\\Program files\\MELSOFT).\nOperate the products under an account that does not have administrator's privileges.\nInstall an antivirus software in computers using the products.\nRestrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary and ensure they are not accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the network.\nUse virtual private network (VPN) when remote access is required.\n\nAdditional information about the vulnerability or the Mitsubishi Electric compensating control is available by contacting a Mitsubishi Electric representative.\u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
