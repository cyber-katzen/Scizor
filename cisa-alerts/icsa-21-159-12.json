EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Simcenter Femap* **Vulnerabilities:**  Out\\-of\\-bounds Write2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed and may allow arbitrary remote code execution or data extraction.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Simcenter Femap are affected:* Simcenter Femap 2020\\.2, all versions prior to v2020\\.2\\.MP3* Simcenter Femap 2021\\.1, all versions prior to v2021\\.1\\.MP3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.[CVE\\-2021\\-27387](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27387)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.[CVE\\-2021\\-27399](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27399)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Francis Provencher {PRL} working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Update Simcenter Femap 2020\\.2 to [v2020\\.2\\.MP3 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  .* Update Simcenter Femap 2021\\.1 to [v2021\\.1\\.MP3 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  .* Do not open untrusted modfem files from unknown sources. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-133038](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-133038.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these\u00a0vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
