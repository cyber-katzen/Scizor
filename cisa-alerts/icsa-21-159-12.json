RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed and may allow arbitrary remote code execution or data extraction.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Simcenter Femap are affected:\n\nSimcenter Femap 2020.2, all versions prior to v2020.2.MP3\nSimcenter Femap 2021.1, all versions prior to v2021.1.MP3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.\nCVE-2021-27387 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.\nCVE-2021-27399 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nFrancis Provencher {PRL} working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUpdate Simcenter Femap 2020.2 to v2020.2.MP3 or later version.\nUpdate Simcenter Femap 2021.1 to v2021.1.MP3 or later version.\nDo not open untrusted modfem files from unknown sources.\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-133038\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these\u00a0vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
