MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends that affected users download the latest version of each software product from the following site and update it: [https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/\\#software](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/#software)  The fixed versions are as follows:* CPU Module Logging Configuration Tool, Version 1\\.100E or later* CW Configurator, Version 1\\.011M or later* EM Software Development Kit (EM Configurator), Version 1\\.015R or later* GT Designer3\uff08GOT2000\\), Version 1\\.225K or later* GX LogViewer, Version 1\\.100E or later* GX Works2, Version 1\\.590Q or later* GX Works3, Version 1\\.060N or later* M\\_CommDTM\\-HART, Version 1\\.01B or later* M\\_CommDTM\\-IO\\-Link, Version 1\\.03D or later* MELFA\\-Works, Version 4\\.4 or later* MELSEC\\-L Flexible High\\-Speed I/O Control Module Configuration Tool, Version 1\\.005F or later* MELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator, Version 1\\.04E or later* MELSOFT iQ AppPortal, Version 1\\.14Q or later* MELSOFT Navigator, Version 2\\.62Q or later* MI Configurator, Version 1\\.004E or later* Motion Control Setting, Version 1\\.006G or later* MR Configurator2, Version 1\\.100E or later* MT Works2, Version 1\\.160S or later* RT ToolBox2, Version 3\\.73B or later* RT ToolBox3, Version 1\\.60N or later For affected users who cannot immediately update the software products, Mitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of these vulnerabilities:* Make sure that the file is obtained from the correct acquisition route when users receive a project file or a configuration data file from another person via mail, USB memory, file server, etc. (Or, check that there is no file of unknown source.)* Operate the products under an account that does not have administrative privileges.* Install an antivirus software in your personal computer using the products.* Restrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary, and ensure that they are not accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Use Virtual Private Network (VPN) when remote access is required. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
