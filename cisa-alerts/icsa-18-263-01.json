EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Tec4Data\nEquipment: SmartCooler\nVulnerability: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the device to shut down by exploiting missing authentication for a critical function.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SmartCooler, a cooling appliance, are affected:\n\nSmartCooler, all versions prior to firmware 180806\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nThe device responds to a remote unauthenticated reboot command that may be used to perform a denial of service attack.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-14796 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Austria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAnkit Anubhav of NewSky Security reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nTec4Data has released new firmware to address the vulnerability and has distributed the new firmware to affected devices.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
