This vulnerability was reported to Siemens by Adam Hahn and Manimaran Govindarasu for coordinated disclosure.\nThe first issue is a brute-force credential guessing vulnerability in the web configuration interface of the firewall. The second issue is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Profinet DCP protocol stack.\nSiemens has published a patch that resolves both of the identified vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nThe following Scalance S Security Modules are affected:\n\nScalance S602 V2\nScalance S612 V2\nScalance S613 V2\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of the brute-force vulnerability may allow an attacker to perform an arbitrary number of authentication attempts using different password and eventually gain access to the targeted account.\nSuccessful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow against the Profinet DCP protocol may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition or possible arbitrary code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nThe Scalance S product is a security module that includes a Stateful Inspection Firewall for industrial automation network applications. This security module is intended to protect automation devices and industrial networks against unauthorized access and to secure Ethernet-based industrial communication.\nThis Siemens product is intended to protect trusted industrial networks from outside facing or untrusted networks. All Scalance S Security Modules provide filtering of incoming and outgoing network connections with stateful packet inspection. This product is used predominately in Europe and Asia with a small US footprint. The primary sectors deploying Scalance S are Automotive, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, Critical Manufacturing, Transportation Systems, Chemical, and Water.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nBrute-Force Vulnerabilityhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html, CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, website last accessed April 11, 2012.\nThe web server in the Scalance S Security Module does not implement sufficient measures to prevent rapid multiple authentication attempts within a short timeframe, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks by attackers with access to the web server. If the administrative password is found, the attackercan manipulate the configuration and gain access to the trusted network.\nCVE-2012-1799 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 10.0 has also been assigned.\nStack-Based Overflowhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html , CWE-1121: Stack-based buffer Overflow, website last accessed April 11, 2012\nThe Scalance S DCP protocol stack crashes when a specially crafted DCP frame is received, which may renders the firewall unresponsive and interrupts established VPN tunnels. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition or possible arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2012-1800 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Siemens has assigned a CVSS V2 base score of 6.1.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a moderate skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nSiemens has published a patch that resolves both of the identified vulnerabilities and strongly recommends installing the updates by using the following links:\n\nSiemens Security Advisory\nfirmware update\ninformation about industrial security by Siemens\nrecommended security practices by US-CERT\n\nFor further inquiries on vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
