EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: PLC Simulator for EcoStruxure Control Expert\nVulnerability: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition, which could result in a failure of the EcoStruxture Control Expert Simulator.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports the vulnerability affects the following PLC simulators:\u00a0\n\nPLC Simulator for EcoStruxure Control Expert, all versions\nPLC Simulator for Unity Pro (former name of EcoStruxure Control Expert), all versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CHECK FOR UNUSUAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS CWE-754\nA vulnerability exists that could cause a crash of the PLC simulator present in EcoStruxure Control Expert software when receiving a specially crafted request over Modbus.\nCVE-2020-7538 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nParity Dynamics Research Team reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric has released Version 15.0 of the EcoStruxure Control Expert software to mitigate this vulnerability. It is available for download on the Schneider Electric website.\nAfter downloading the fix, the following step is required to mitigate the vulnerability:\n\nIn the option dialog box of the PLC simulator, set the listening IP Address to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), which will prevent remote network connections to the PLC simulator.\n\nThe default listening IP address is: 0.0.0.0. The default setting exposes the PLC to the vulnerability described in this advisory.\nSchneider Electric recommends using appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches. It also strongly recommends the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric\u2019s Customer Care Center for assistance removing a patch.\nIf users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:\n\nSet up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP\nHarden the engineering workstation running PLC Simulator for EcoStruxure Control Expert\nFollow workstation, network, and site-hardening guidelines in the Cybersecurity Best Practices guide.\n\nPlease see Schneider Electric Security Notification number SEVD-2020-315-07 for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
