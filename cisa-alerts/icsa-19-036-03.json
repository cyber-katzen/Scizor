RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  The following versions of LeviStudioU are affected:* LeviStudioU Versions 1\\.8\\.69\u00a0and prior**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 4\\.2\\.1 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) Several heap\\-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow arbitrary code execution.[CVE\\-2019\\-6539](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6539)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.2\\.2 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) Multiple stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited when parsing strings within project files. The process does not properly validate the length of user\\-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed\\-length stack\\-based buffer. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2019\\-6537](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6537)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.2\\.3 [MEMORY CORRUPTION CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) A memory corruption vulnerability has been identified, which may allow arbitrary code execution.[CVE\\-2019\\-6541](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6541)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  China### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Mat Powell, Ziad Badawi, and Natnael Samson working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  WECON has produced Version 1\\.8\\.69 to fix the reported vulnerabilities in Version 1\\.8\\.56; however, exploits are still successful against this updated version. Future software updates will be made available at the following location:[http://www.we\\-con.com.cn/en/download\\_45\\.html](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/download_45.html)  For more information contact WECON customer service: Phone: 0086\\-591\\-87868869\\-894 Website: [http://www.we\\-con.com.cn/en/message.html](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/message.html) **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA also recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](Organizations%20observing%20any%20suspected%20malicious%20activity%20should%20follow%20their%20established%20internal%20procedures%20and%20report%20their%20findings%20to%20CISA%20for%20tracking%20and%20correlation%20against%20other%20incidents.)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
