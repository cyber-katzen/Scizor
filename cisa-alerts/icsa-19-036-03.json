EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: WECON Technology Co., Ltd (WECON)\nEquipment: LeviStudioU\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Memory Corruption\n\n2.\u00a0UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-036-03 WECON LeviStudioU that was published February 5, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\nThe following versions of LeviStudioU are affected:\n\nLeviStudioU Versions 1.8.69\u00a0and prior\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nSeveral heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2019-6539 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited when parsing strings within project files. The process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current process.\nCVE-2019-6537 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MEMORY CORRUPTION CWE-119\nA memory corruption vulnerability has been identified, which may allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2019-6541 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: China\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell, Ziad Badawi, and Natnael Samson working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nWECON has produced Version 1.8.69 to fix the reported vulnerabilities in Version 1.8.56; however, exploits are still successful against this updated version. Future software updates will be made available at the following location:\nhttp://www.we-con.com.cn/en/download_45.html\nFor more information contact WECON customer service:\nPhone: 0086-591-87868869-894\nWebsite: http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/message.html\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA also recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
