MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric recommends upgrading to the versions listed below, which include fixes for the reported vulnerability:* PME 8\\.2 and Energy Expert 1\\.3 and PSO 8\\.2 with Advance Reports and Dashboard Module:[https://schneider\\-electric.box.com/v/PME82\\-CU3\\-GeneralRelease](https://schneider-electric.box.com/v/PME82-CU3-GeneralRelease) * PME 9\\.0 and Energy Expert 2\\.0 and PSO 9\\.0 with Advanced Reports and Dashboards Module:[https://schneider\\-electric.box.com/v/PME90\\-CU1\\-18328\\-01](https://schneider-electric.box.com/v/PME90-CU1-18328-01)  For more information refer to Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification:[https://www.schneider\\-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2018\\-347\\-01](https://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-347-01)  Schneider Electric also recommends the following cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.* All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended.* All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
