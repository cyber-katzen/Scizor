This may allow an attacker to specify a filename to execute unauthorized code and modify files or data.[CVE\\-2020\\-11999](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-11999)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) The parsing mechanism that processes certain file types does not provide input sanitation. This may allow an attacker to use specially crafted files to traverse the file system and modify or expose sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2020\\-12001](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12001)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) An exposed API call allows users to provide files to be processed without sanitation. This may allow an attacker to use specially crafted requests to traverse the file system and expose sensitive data on the local hard drive.[CVE\\-2020\\-12003](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12003)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE\\-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html) A vulnerability exists in the communication function that enables users to upload EDS files by FactoryTalk Linx. This may allow an attacker to upload a file with bad compression, consuming all the available CPU resources, leading to a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2020\\-12005](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12005)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sharon Brizinov and Amir Preminger (VP Research) of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Rockwell Automation and CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation recommends users apply these patches by following instructions in knowledgebase articles below:* [Patch Roll\\-up for CPR9 SRx](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1066644)  (Login Required)* FactoryTalk Linx/Services patch [RAID\\# 1124820](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1124820/)  (Login Required)* FactoryTalk Linx patch [RAID\\# 1126433](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1126433)  (Login Required) Network\\-based vulnerability mitigations for embedded products:* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol\\-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP Ports 2222, 7153, and UDP Port 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see Knowledgebase Article ID [898270](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/898270) General mitigations:* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. For more information, please refer to Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory: [54102\\-Industrial Security Advisory Index](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/54102)  . CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  .
