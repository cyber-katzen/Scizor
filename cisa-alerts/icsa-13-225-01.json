This advisory provides mitigation details for a vulnerability in Advantech\u2019s WebAccess application.\nIndependent researcher Sanadi Antu identified a cross-site scripting vulnerability and released proof-of-concept (exploit) code for Advantech WebAccess application without coordination with ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity known to ICS-CERT. Advantech has created a patch to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nExploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAdvantech reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of WebAccess:\n\nAdvantech WebAccess 7.0 and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation will allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary HTML code in a user\u2019s browser session in the context of a vulnerable application.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAdvantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.\nAdvantech WebAccess, formally known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a Web-based SCADA and human-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, and building automation systems (commercial and government facilities).\u00a0 These systems are deployed globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTINGCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013.\n\nInput sent from a malicious client is not properly verified by the server. By sending invalid input through the WebAccess Client interface, an attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in another user\u2019s browser session.\nCVE-2013-2299NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2299, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:N, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nExploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nAdvantech has created a patch to mitigate this vulnerability. Users may download the latest version of WebAccess (V 7.1 2013.05.30) at the following location on the Advantech website:\nhttp://support.advantech.com.tw/support/DownloadSRDetail_New.aspx?SR_ID=1-MS9MJV&Doc_Source=Download\nAdvantech has also created the following site to share additional information about WebAccess:\nhttp://webaccess.advantech.com/\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013. that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
