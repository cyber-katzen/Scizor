MITIGATIONS--------------- Roche recommends the following mitigation procedures for connected devices (Ethernet and Wi\\-Fi):* Restrict network and physical access to the device and attached infrastructure by enabling the device security features.* Protect connected endpoints from unauthorized access, theft, and malicious software.* Monitor the system and network infrastructure for suspicious activity and report a suspected compromise according to local policy. For non\\-connected devices:* Protect from unauthorized access, theft and manipulation. For all affected products, Roche Diagnostic has scheduled release of new software updates with availability beginning November 2018\\. For further information or concerns, please contact a local Roche Diagnostics office at the following location:<https://www.roche.com/about/business/roche_worldwide.htm> NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
