MITIGATIONS\nRoche recommends the following mitigation procedures for connected devices (Ethernet and Wi-Fi):\n\nRestrict network and physical access to the device and attached infrastructure by enabling the device security features.\nProtect connected endpoints from unauthorized access, theft, and malicious software.\nMonitor the system and network infrastructure for suspicious activity and report a suspected compromise according to local policy.\u00a0\n\nFor non-connected devices:\n\nProtect from unauthorized access, theft and manipulation.\n\nFor all affected products, Roche Diagnostic has scheduled release of new software updates with availability beginning November 2018.\nFor further information or concerns, please contact a local Roche Diagnostics office at the following location:\u00a0\nhttps://www.roche.com/about/business/roche_worldwide.htm\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
