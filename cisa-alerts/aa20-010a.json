Affected organizations that have not applied the software patch to fix an arbitrary file reading vulnerability, known as CVE-2019-11510, can become compromised in an attack. [1]\nAlthough Pulse Secure [2] disclosed the vulnerability and provided software patches for the various affected products in April 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) continues to observe wide exploitation of CVE-2019-11510. [3] [4] [5]\nCISA expects to see continued attacks exploiting unpatched Pulse Secure VPN environments and strongly urges users and administrators to upgrade to the corresponding fixes. [6]\nTimelines of Specific Events\n\nApril 24, 2019 \u2013 Pulse Secure releases initial advisory and software updates addressing multiple vulnerabilities.\nMay 28, 2019 \u2013 Large commercial vendors get reports of vulnerable VPN through HackerOne.\nJuly 31, 2019 \u2013 Full use of exploit demonstrated using the admin session hash to get complete shell.\nAugust 8, 2019 \u2013 Meh Chang and Orange Tsai demonstrate the VPN issues across multiple vendors (Pulse Secure) with detailed attack on active VPN exploitation.\nAugust 24, 2019 \u2013 Bad Packets identifies over 14,500 vulnerable VPN servers globally still unpatched and in need of an upgrade.\nOctober 7, 2019 \u2013 The National Security Agency (NSA) produces a Cybersecurity Advisory on Pulse Secure and other VPN products being targeted actively by advanced persistent threat actors.\nOctober 16, 2019 \u2013 The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) releases Vulnerability Note VU#927237: Pulse Secure VPN contains multiple vulnerabilities.\nJanuary 2020 \u2013 Media reports cybercriminals now targeting unpatched Pulse Secure VPN servers to install REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nImpact\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to compromise a vulnerable VPN server. The attacker may be able to gain access to all active users and their plain-text credentials. It may also be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on each VPN client as it successfully connects to the VPN server.\nAffected versions:\n\nPulse Connect Secure 9.0R1 - 9.0R3.3\nPulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 - 8.3R7\nPulse Connect Secure 8.2R1 - 8.2R12\nPulse Connect Secure 8.1R1 - 8.1R15\nPulse Policy Secure 9.0R1 - 9.0R3.1\nPulse Policy Secure 5.4R1 - 5.4R7\nPulse Policy Secure 5.3R1 - 5.3R12\nPulse Policy Secure 5.2R1 - 5.2R12\nPulse Policy Secure 5.1R1 - 5.1R15\n\n\nMitigations\n\nThis vulnerability has no viable workarounds except for applying the patches provided by the vendor and performing required system updates.\nCISA strongly urges users and administrators to upgrade to the corresponding fixes.
