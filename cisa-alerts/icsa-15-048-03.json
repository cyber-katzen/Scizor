CodeWrights GmbH has addressed the vulnerability with a new library, which both companies have begun to integrate.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe Yokogawa HART Device DTM used by the following devices is impacted:\n\nADMAG AE Series Magnetic Flowmeters (AE/AE14) Rev.1 & 2,\nADMAG SE Series Magnetic Flowmeters (SE/SE14) Rev.1 & 2,\nAM11 Magnetic Flowmeter Remote Converter Rev.1,\nAXFA11 Magnetic Flowmeter Remote Converter Rev.1,\nADMAG AXF Series Magnetic Flowmeters (AXF/AXFA14) Rev.1,\nADMAG AXR Two-wire Magnetic Flowmeters Rev.1 & 2,\ndigitalYEWFLO Vortex Flowmeter Rev.1, 2, 3, & 4,\nDpharp EJA /EJA-A Series Pressure Transmitters/Differential PressureTransmitters Rev.1, 2, & 3,\nDpharp EJX Series Pressure Transmitters/Differential PressureTransmitters Rev.1, 2, & 3,\nEJX Multivariable Transmitters\uff08EJX910A/EJX930A) Rev.1 & 2,\nRotameter Rev.1,\nCoriolis Mass Flowmeters- ROTAMASS 3-Series(RCCT3x/RCCF31) Rev.1, 2, & 3,\nCoriolis Mass Flowmeters(CF11) Rev.1,\nDifferential Pressure Transmitters Rev.1,\nYEWFLO Vortex Flowmeter Rev.1 & 2,\nYT200 Temperature Transmitters Rev.1,\nYTA110/YTA310/YTA320 Temperature Transmitters Rev.1, 2, & 3,\nYTA70 Temperature Transmitters Rev.1,\nAV550G Rev.1,\nDO202 Rev.1,\nISC202 Rev.1,\nISC450 Rev.1 & 2,\nPH150 Rev.1 & 2,\nPH202 Rev.1,\nPH450 Rev.1 & 2,\nSC150 Rev.1 & 2,\nSC202 Rev.1,\nSC450Rev.1 & 2,\nZR202 Rev.1, and\nZR402 Rev.1.\n\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerability causes a buffer overflow in the HART Device DTM crashing the Field Device Tool (FDT) Frame Application. The Frame Application must then be restarted. The Frame Application is primarily used for remote configuration. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not result in loss of information, control, or view by the control system of the HART devices on the 4-20mA HART Loop.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nYokogawa is a company based in Japan that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and East Asia.\nThe affected product is the DTM library used by Yokogawa HART-based field devices in the FDT/DTM Frame Application. According to Yokogawa, these products are deployed across multiple critical infrastructure sectors. Yokogawa estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nBUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html, web site last accessed February 17, 2015./IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, web site last accessed February 17, 2015.\n\nSuccessful injection of specially crafted packets to the Device DTM causes a buffer overflow condition in the Frame Application. The FDT Frame Application becomes unresponsive, and the Device DTM stops functioning.\nCVE-2014-9191NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9191, web site last accessed February 17, 2015. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 1.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, web site last accessed February 17, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis exploit on the FDT/DTM Frame Application is possible from any adjacent network that receives or passes packets from the HART Device DTM.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nThis is a complex vulnerability. Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Compromised access that allows access to the packets transmitted to Frame Application is required for exploitation. This exploit also requires a specific timing to crash the Frame Application. This increases the difficulty of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nYokogawa has released an advisory (YSAR-15-0001) to address this issue. It can be found at the following location:\nhttp://www.yokogawa.com/dcs/security/ysar/YSAR-15-0001E.pdf\nPlease contact your local Yokogawa office to obtain the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability. There are offices worldwide; North American office contact information is listed on the following web site:\nhttp://www.yokogawa.com/us/contact/index.htm#find-a-yokogawa-office\nJPCERT has also released an advisory (JVNVU # 96347573) to disclose this information. It can be found in the following location:\nhttp://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU96347573/index.html (Japanese)\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
