Sinapsi has produced a new version to mitigate this vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Sinapsi eSolar Light versions are affected:\n\nSinapsi eSolar Light firmware versions prior to 2.0.3970_schsl_2.2.85.\n\nIMPACT\nAccess to the plaintext passwords will compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the mail client.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSinapsi is an Italy-based company.\nThe affected product, Sinapsi eSolar Light, is a stand-alone system for the monitoring and management of local and remote maintenance of small size photovoltaic (PV) plants. According to Schneider Electric, Sinapsi eSolar Light is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Sinapsi estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPLAIN TEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORDCWE-256: Plain Text Storage of a Password, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html, web site last accessed June 09, 2015.\n\nAn attacker is able to view saved passwords from the DNS and mail configuration by viewing the mail configuration page source.\nCVE-2015-3949NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3949, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed June 09, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user accesses the mail configuration option.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSinapsi has developed a fix for the problem in firmware version 2.0.3970_schsl_2.2.85. Contact Sinapsi through its web site for support in obtaining this firmware.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability by ensuring the firmware version is up to date.\nSuggestions for additional mitigation solutions besides updating the firmware include:\n\nLimit access to the system to those who need access.\nChange passwords frequently.\nIsolate PCs from other functions.\nEnsure physical security is in place, so that someone cannot just walk in and steal your passwords.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
