RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed and may allow remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DIAScreen sofware are affected:\n\nAll versions prior to v1.1.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843\nDIAScreen is vulnerable to type confusion, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-32965 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nDIAScreen is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write condition, which may result in a system crash or allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-32969 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKimiya, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics released Version 1.1.0 of DIAScreen and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
