[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySierra Wireless AirLink Router with ALEOS Software================================================== Last Revised January 26, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-026\\-041\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.0*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Sierra Wireless* **Equipment:**  AirLink Router with ALEOS Software* **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a loss of sensitive information and could allow remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Sierra Wireless reports the following versions of AirLink router with ALEOS software are affected:* Airlink Router (ES450, GX450\\) running ALEOS software: Versions 4\\.9\\.7 and prior* Airlink Router (MP70, RV50, RV50x, RV55, LX 40, LX60\\) running ALEOS software: Versions prior to 4\\.16\\.0### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE\\-88](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html)** AirLink router versions with ALEOS software are vulnerable when users with valid ACEManager credentials and access to the ACEManager interface could manipulate the IP logging operation to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-46649](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-46649)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE\\-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)** AirLink router versions with ALEOS software are vulnerable when users with valid ACEManager credentials and access to the ACEManager interface could reconfigure the device to expose the ACEManager credentials on the pre\\-login status page.[CVE\\-2022\\-46650](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-46650)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Canada### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Roni Gavrilov and Eran Jacob from OTORIO reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Sierra Wireless recommends upgrading the following affected devices:* Upgrade MP70, RV50, RV50x, RV55, LX 40, LX60 to ALEOS [version 4\\.16\\.0](https://www.sierrawireless.com/support/)  or later* Upgrade ES450, GX450 to ALEOS [version 4\\.9\\.8](https://www.sierrawireless.com/support/)  (when available) or later Sierra Wireless recommends the following mitigations:* Always use strong, and ideally unique random credentials for devices. ALEOS devices ship with unique random credentials by default.* Disable access to ACEManager on the wide area network (WAN) and use the Sierra Wireless Airlink Management System (ALMS) or an alternative device management platform for remote management of ALEOS devices.* If the ACEManager must remain accessible via the WAN, restrict access using measures such as Private APN, VPN, or the ALEOS Trusted IP feature (restricts access to specific hosts). CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
