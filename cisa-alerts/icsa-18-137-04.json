EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.3*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor**  : Delta Electronics* **Equipment**  : Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor* **Vulnerability**  : Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-18\\-137\\-04 Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor that was published May 17, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT website.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could crash the accessed device, resulting in a buffer overflow condition that may allow remote code execution.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor, a programming software for Delta text panels operating on Windows, are affected:* Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor, Version 1\\.89 or prior.### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### 4\\.2\\.1 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) Parsing a malformed program file may cause heap\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability, which may allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-8871](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-8871)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Commercial Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health* **Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location:**  Taiwan### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER A security researcher Robert Hawes/Twitter@VulnMind working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Delta Electronics recommends affected users update to the latest version of Delta Industrial Automation TPEditor, Version 1\\.90, which is available for download at:[http://www.deltaww.com/Products/PluginWebUserControl/downloadCenterCounter.aspx?DID\\=4333\\&DocPath\\=1\\&hl\\=en\\-US](http://www.deltaww.com/Products/PluginWebUserControl/downloadCenterCounter.aspx?DID=4333&DocPath=1&hl=en-US)  . Until users update to the new version of TPEditor, the company suggests affected users should restrict the interaction with the application to trusted files. NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
