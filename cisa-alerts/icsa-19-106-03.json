A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\nABB, Phoenix, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and WAGO are companies based in Europe that deploy their PLCs worldwide across the following critical infrastructure sectors: Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems.\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMatthias Niedermaier (Hochschule Augsburg), Jan-Ole Malchow (Freie Universita\u0308t Berlin), and Florian Fischer (Hochschule Augsburg) reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0Mikael Vingaard found and reported to CISA additional devices containing this vulnerability.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nPLC vendors have responded to queries about this report with the following mitigations:\n5.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ABB\nABB concludes the reported behavior is not a vulnerability but is due to a misconfiguration of the PLC watchdog, which was left in the default factory settings. This has led to a configuration that does not match the expectations expressed in the test cases and the result is the PLC not reacting as intended. This misconfiguration can be fixed by setting an appropriate combination of task priority, task cycle time, and watchdog settings. Please see the \u201cOnboard Ethernet Handling in CPU Firmware\u201d chapter (System Technology for AC500 V2 Products > System Technology of CPU and Overall System > Onboard Technologies > Ethernet > Ethernet Protocols and Ports for AC500 V2 Products > Onboard Ethernet Handling in CPU Firmware) for further guidance.\n5.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PHOENIX CONTACT\nPhoenix Contact acknowledges this as a \u201cknown, won\u2019t fix\u201d issue for old products. Currently available products provide countermeasures to mitigate the impact on the safety-related functionality. Phoenix Contact urges users to adhere to the\u00a0Application note 107913_en_01.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nMore information can be found in the VDE CERT advisory.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n5.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC\nFixes are available in the Modicon M221 firmware v1.10.0.0 and the EcoStruxure Machine Expert \u2013 Basic v1.0 software (formerly SoMachine Basic) using either of the following options:\n\nUse this link to download the Machine Expert Basic software.\nOr run the Schneider Electric Software Update tool in order to download and install EcoStruxure Machine Expert \u2013 Basic v1.0 software.\nFor additional information, see the Schneider Electric security notice SEVD-2019-045-01.\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices, such as:\n\nPhysical controls should be in place so no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.\nAll controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\nAll programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices it is intended.\nAll methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) should be scanned before use in terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nLaptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\n\n5.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0SIEMENS\nSiemens has investigated the vulnerability report on PLC cycle time influences and concludes the report does not demonstrate a valid vulnerability for Siemens PLCs.\n5.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WAGO\nWAGO recommends users operate the devices in closed networks or protect them with a firewall against unauthorized access. Another recommended mitigation is to limit network traffic via the switch rate limit feature according to application needs.\nPlease also consult the product manuals on the WAGO website, as this is a known problem for some devices. Links to product manuals and specific instructions about how to limit switch rates can be found in the VDE CERT advisory.\n5.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CISA\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
