Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\n\nThe path traversal vulnerability exists when an application does not neutralize external input to ensure that users are not calling for absolute path sequences outside of their privilege level.\nCVE-2017-6020 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nKarn Ganeshen, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), discovered this vulnerability.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector(s): Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: South America\nCompany Headquarters Location: Joinville-SC, Brazil\n\u00a0\n",
