Philips reported the publicly disclosed vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPhilips recommends users update Tasy EMR HTML5 to Version 3.06.1804 or later with the latest available service pack where both CVEs are remediated.\nUsers with questions regarding their specific Philips TASY EMR system are advised by Philips to contact their Customer Success Manager (CSM), local Philips service support team, or regional service support. Users can also contact Philips on its\u00a0company website.\nThe Philips advisory for these vulnerabilities is available on Philips product security website.\nPlease see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
