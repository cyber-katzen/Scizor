MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n According to Baxter, software updates to disable Telnet and FTP (CVE\\-2022\\-26392\\) are in process. Software updates addressing the format string attack (CVE\\-2022\\-26393\\) are included in WBM version 20D30 and all other WBM versions authentication is already available in Spectrum IQ (CVE\\-2022\\-26394\\).\n \n\n\n\n Instructions to erase all data and settings on WBMs and pumps before decommissioning and transferring to other facilities (CVE\\-2022\\-26390\\) are in process for incorporation into the Spectrum Operator\u2019s Manual.\n \n\n\n\n Baxter provides recommended steps for erasing all data and settings on the pump to be decommissioned:\n \n\n\n* Reset the network settings (Biomed\\-\\>Network Configuration\\-\\>Transfer Network Settings\\-\\>Reset).\n* Delete the drug library.\n* Clear the history log.\n\n\n\n To erase all data and settings on the WBM to be decommissioned:\n \n\n\n* Select a pump other than the one last used with the WBM.\n* Reset the network settings and enable networking on the pump.\n* Place the WBM on the pump.\n* Wait until the network icon turns yellow.\n\n\n\n In conjunction with the user\u2019s own network security policies, Baxter recommends the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood these vulnerabilities will be exploited:\n \n\n\n* Ensure appropriate physical controls within user environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices.\n* Isolate the Spectrum Infusion Systems to its own network virtual local area network (VLAN) to segregate the system from other hospital systems and reduce the probability that a threat actor could execute an adjacent attack, such as a machine\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack against the system to observe clear\\-text communications.\n* Use the strongest available wireless network security protocols (WPA2, EAP\\-TLS, etc.) to provide authentication/encryption of wireless data sent to/from the Spectrum Infusion System.\n* Users should ensure the WBM is rebooted after configuration for their network(s) by removing the WBM from the rear of the Spectrum device for 10\\-15 seconds, and then re\\-attaching the WBM.\n* Users should always monitor for and/or block unexpected traffic, such as FTP and Telnet, at network boundaries into the Spectrum\\-specific VLAN.\n\n\n\n As a last resort, users may disable wireless operation of the pump; the Spectrum Infusion System was designed to operate without network access. This action would impact an organization\u2019s ability to rapidly deploy drug library (formulary) updates to their pumps.\n \n\n\n\n For additional information, see the\n [Baxter Product Security Bulletin](https://www.baxter.com/product-security#additionalresources) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\n [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
