The researchers have tested the new version to confirm that it resolves the vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nAccording to Ocean Data System the following versions are affected:\u2022 Dream Reports versions prior to Version 4.0\nImpact\nSuccessful attacks could result in data leakage, denial of service, or remote code execution.Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nOcean Data Systems is a France-based company that focuses on reporting software for control systems.According to Ocean Data Systems, Dream Report is deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, building automation, oil and gas, water and wastewater, healthcare, and electric utilities. Ocean Data Systems states that these products are used primarily in France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Israel, United States, and Germany.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nCross Site Scripting\nA XSS vulnerability exists in the Ocean Data Dream Report application due to the lack of server-side validation of query string parameter values. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user visit a specially crafted URL, which injects client-side scripts into the server\u2019s HTTP response to the client.CVE-2011-4038http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4038, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE website report. This website will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nWrite Access Violation\nA write access violation vulnerability exists in the Ocean Data Dream Report application. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user opens a specially crafted file. This may result in arbitrary code execution.CVE-2011-4039http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4039, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE website report. This website will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThe XSS vulnerability is remotely exploitable.The write access violation is not remotely exploitable and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads a malformed file.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill level can create the XSS exploit.Crafting a working exploit for the access violation vulnerability would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMitigation\nDownload the latest version of Dream Reports from Ocean Data\u2019s website: http://www.dreamreport.net/php/download/download.php?lang=en\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\u2022 Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\u2022 Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\u2022 When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n",
