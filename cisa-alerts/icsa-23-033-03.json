RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nBaicells reports this vulnerability affects the following Nova LTE TDD eNodeB devices with firmware through RTS/RTD 3.6.6:\u00a0\n\nNova 227\u00a0\nNova 233\u00a0\nNova 243\u00a0\nNova 246\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\u00a0\nBaicells Nova 227, Nova 233, Nova 243 LTE TDD eNodeB devices and Nova 246 with firmware through RTS/RTD 3.6.6 are vulnerable to remote shell code exploitation via HTTP command injections. Commands are executed using pre-login execution and executed with root permissions.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-24508\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRustam Amin reported this vulnerability to CISA\n4. MITIGATIONS\nBaicells resolved this vulnerability in firmware version 3.7.11.3 and later. Baicells recommends all users currently running an earlier version of RTS/RTD upgrade their devices to the 3.7.11.6 firmware. Firmware can be downloaded from the\u00a0Baicells community page\u00a0or upgraded via OMC.\u00a0\nBaicells published a\u00a0security vulnerability notice\u00a0for this issue\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
