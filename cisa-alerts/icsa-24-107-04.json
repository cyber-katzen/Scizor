RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker crashing the program through heap-based buffer overflow.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of RoboDK, a robotics development software, are affected:\n\nRoboDK: RoboDK v5.5.4 (Windows 64 bit)\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe affected product is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow while processing a specific project file. The resulting memory corruption may crash the application.\nCVE-2024-0257 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Canada\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHank Chen, while working with TXOne Networks, reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRoboDK did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of RoboDK are encouraged to contact RoboDK and keep their systems up to date.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nApril 16, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
