EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3**  3\\.3* **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  RoboDK* **Equipment:**  RoboDK* **Vulnerability:**  Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker crashing the program through heap\\-based buffer overflow.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of RoboDK, a robotics development software, are affected:* RoboDK: RoboDK v5\\.5\\.4 (Windows 64 bit)### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) The affected product is vulnerable to heap\\-based buffer overflow while processing a specific project file. The resulting memory corruption may crash the application.[CVE\\-2024\\-0257](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-0257)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Canada### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hank Chen, while working with TXOne Networks, reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- RoboDK did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of RoboDK are encouraged to contact RoboDK and keep their systems up to date. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.5\\.
