[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRexroth Bosch BLADEcontrol\\-WebVIS Vulnerabilities================================================== Last Revised July 06, 2016 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-187\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Independent researcher Maxim Rupp has identified a SQL injection vulnerability and a cross\\-site scripting vulnerability in the Rexroth Bosch BLADEcontrol\\-WebVIS. Rexroth Bosch has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following BLADEcontrol\\-WebVIS versions are affected: BLADEcontrol\\-WebVIS, Version 3\\.0\\.2 and earlier.IMPACT------ Application is vulnerable to a SQL injection vulnerability by performing database operations that were unintended by the web application designer and, in some instances, can lead to compromise of the database server or lead to remote code execution. Application also fails to validate, filter, or encode user input before returning it to a user\u2019s web client. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Rexroth Bosch is a Germany\\-based company that maintains offices in 22 countries around the world, including the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, India, Germany, France, Czech Republic, China, and Australia. The affected product, BLADEcontrol, is a web\\-based HMI system. According to Rexroth Bosch, BLADEcontrol is deployed across the Energy sector. Rexroth Bosch estimates that this product is used in 80 countries.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VUNLNERABILITY OVERVIEW**SQL INJECTION**  CWE\\-564: SQL Injection, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/564\\.html, web site last accessed July 5, 2016\\.

Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
