C3-ilex\u2019s has produced a patch that resolves these vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nC3-ilex reports that the vulnerabilities affect all EOScada versions prior to 11.0.19.2.\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause a DoS or data leakage.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nC3-ilex\u2019s EOScada is a real-time Windows-based Energy Management System for electrical, water, sewage, and gas applications. The EOScada platform features a distributed processing, networked configuration using PCs running Microsoft Windows. The EOScada product line includes PC-based Master Stations as well as remote terminal units (RTUs) that perform communication, data concentration, and connections to a variety of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs).\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nImproper Access Controlhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012.\nThe EOS Core Scada.exe does not restrict access that causes a DoS condition when attached to Port 5050/TCP or Port 24004/TCP, and any random data are sent to either port. The application will crash and restart and will be unavailable to legitimate users during that time.\nCVE-2012-1810 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5.0 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).\nResource Management Errors http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012.\nThe EOSDataServer.exe attached to Port 24006/TCP is susceptible to a Resource Management Error when a large amount of random data is sent to the port.\nCVE-2012-1811 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7.8 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).\nData Leakage http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012.\nThe eosfailoverservice.exe returns data in clear text when a connection is made to Port TCP/12000.\nCVE-2012-1812 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5.0 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).\nResource Management Errorshttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012.\nThe eosfailoverservice.exe attached to Port 12000/TCP is susceptible to a Resource Management Error when a large amount of random data is sent to the port.\nCVE-2012-1813 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7.8 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nC3-ilex recommends customers install the EOScada patch. Customers with a service agreement should contact C3-ilex\u2019s Helpdesk at helpdesk@c3ilex.com or by calling the Help Desk at (510) 659-8300 x 107 for instructions on how to obtain the release. Customers without a service agreement should contact their C3-ilex Sales Manager for assistance in purchasing this or a later version release.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, specifically addressing traffic to the ports listed above, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
