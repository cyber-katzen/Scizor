[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryC3\\-ilex EOScada Multiple Vulnerabilities========================================= Last Revised April 30, 2013 Alert Code ICSA\\-12\\-271\\-01Overview-------- This Advisory is a follow\\-up release to the original Advisory which was posted to the US\\-CERT secure Portal library October 08, 2012\\. Dale Peterson of Digital Bond has identified multiple vulnerabilities in the C3\\-ilex\u2019s EOScada application that can result in data leakage and a denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) condition. C3\\-ilex\u2019s has produced a patch that resolves these vulnerabilities.Affected Products----------------- C3\\-ilex reports that the vulnerabilities affect all EOScada versions prior to 11\\.0\\.19\\.2\\.Impact------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause a DoS or data leakage. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- C3\\-ilex\u2019s EOScada is a real\\-time Windows\\-based Energy Management System for electrical, water, sewage, and gas applications. The EOScada platform features a distributed processing, networked configuration using PCs running Microsoft Windows. The EOScada product line includes PC\\-based Master Stations as well as remote terminal units (RTUs) that perform communication, data concentration, and connections to a variety of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs).Vulnerability Characterization------------------------------### Vulnerability Overview#### Improper Access Controlhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284\\.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012\\. The EOS Core Scada.exe does not restrict access that causes a DoS condition when attached to Port 5050/TCP or Port 24004/TCP, and any random data are sent to either port. The application will crash and restart and will be unavailable to legitimate users during that time.[CVE\\-2012\\-1810](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-1810)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5\\.0 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P))  .#### Resource Management Errors http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399\\.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012\\. The EOSDataServer.exe attached to Port 24006/TCP is susceptible to a Resource Management Error when a large amount of random data is sent to the port.[CVE\\-2012\\-1811](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-1811)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7\\.8 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C))  .#### Data Leakage http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200\\.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012\\. The eosfailoverservice.exe returns data in clear text when a connection is made to Port TCP/12000\\.[CVE\\-2012\\-1812](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-1812)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 5\\.0 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N))  .#### Resource Management Errorshttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399\\.html, Web site last accessed November 01, 2012\\. The eosfailoverservice.exe attached to Port 12000/TCP is susceptible to a Resource Management Error when a large amount of random data is sent to the port.[CVE\\-2012\\-1813](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-1813)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7\\.8 has also been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C))  .### Vulnerability Details#### Exploitability These vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.#### Existence of Exploit No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.#### Difficulty An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.Mitigation---------- C3\\-ilex recommends customers install the EOScada patch. Customers with a service agreement should contact C3\\-ilex\u2019s Helpdesk at [helpdesk@c3ilex.com](mailto:helpdesk@c3ilex.com)  or by calling the Help Desk at (510\\) 659\\-8300 x 107 for instructions on how to obtain the release. Customers without a service agreement should contact their C3\\-ilex Sales Manager for assistance in purchasing this or a later version release. ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, specifically addressing traffic to the ports listed above, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [*Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html) . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
