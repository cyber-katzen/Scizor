RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disclose information and to execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Horner Automation\u2019s Cscape are affected:\u00a0\n\nCscape: v9.90 SP8\u00a0\nCscape EnvisionRV: v4.70\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP). This could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29503 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP). This could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the FontManager. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32281 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g.., CSP). This could lead to an out-of-bounds read in IO_CFG. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32289 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP). This could lead to an out-of-bounds read in Cscape!CANPortMigration. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32545 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing font files (e.g., FNT). This could lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-27916 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP). This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-28653 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\u00a0\nThe affected product does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed CSP file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-31244 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.8\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\u00a0\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., HMI). This could lead to an out-of-bounds write at CScape_EnvisionRV+0x2e374b. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-32203 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
