Meteocontrol has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following WEB\u2019log products are affected:\n\nBasic 100 all versions,\nLight all versions,\nPro all versions, and\nPro Unlimited all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSensitive information can be accessed, and admin login pages are accessible without being authenticated.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as modifying plant data; modifying modbus/inverter/other devices; configuration parameters; and saving modified configuration and device reboot.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nMeteocontrol is a Germany-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, China, Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland, and Israel.\nThe affected products, WEB\u2019log, are web-based SCADA systems that provide functions to manage energy and power configurations in different connected (energy/industrial) devices. According to Meteocontrol, WEB\u2019log is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Meteocontrol estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe with a small percentage in the United States.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nIMPROPER ACCESS CONTROLCWE-284:Improper Access Control, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html, web site last accessed May 17, 2016.\n\nAll application functionality, and configuration pages, including those accessible after administrative login, can be accessed without any authentication.\nCVE-2016-2296NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2296, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

It is not intended to be used with a direct connection to the Internet. Meteocontrol has produced a new version that fixes the vulnerabilities. It can be downloaded at:\nhttp://us.meteocontrol.com/downloads/.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
