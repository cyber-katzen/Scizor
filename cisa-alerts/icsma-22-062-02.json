EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.0*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)* **Equipment:**  Viper LT* **Vulnerability:**  Use of Hard\\-coded Credentials2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive information.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of BD Viper LT, an automated molecular testing system, are affected:* BD Viper LT system: All Versions 2\\.0 and later### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) The affected product is vulnerable due to the use of hard\\-coded credentials, which may allow a threat actor to access, modify, or delete sensitive information including electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII).[CVE\\-2022\\-22765](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-22765)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER BD voluntarily reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- BD is working to remediate the hard\\-coded credentials vulnerability in the BD Viper LT system and is providing this information to increase awareness. The fix is expected in an upcoming BD Viper LT system Version 4\\.80 software release. Additionally, BD recommends the following compensating controls for users of the BD Viper LT systems that utilize hard\\-coded credentials:* Ensure physical access controls are in place and only authorized end\\-users have access to the BD Viper LT system.* Disconnect the BD Viper LT system from network access, where applicable.* If the BD Viper LT system must be connected to a network, ensure industry standard network security policies and procedures are followed.
