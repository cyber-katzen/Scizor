EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4430G\nVulnerability: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nThe Treck TCP/IP stack on affected devices improperly handles length parameter inconsistencies. Unauthenticated remote attackers may be able to send specially crafted IP packets which could lead to a denial of service condition or remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, CMIIT (6GT2701-5DB23): All versions\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, ETSI (6GT2701-5DB03): All versions\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, FCC (6GT2701-5DB13): All versions\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, ISED (6GT2701-5DB33): All versions\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4430G, Chirp, ETSI, FCC, ISED, IP65 (6GT2701-5CB03): All versions\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER HANDLING OF LENGTH PARAMETER INCONSISTENCY CWE-130\nThe Treck TCP/IP stack on affected devices improperly handles length parameter inconsistencies. Unauthenticated remote attackers may be able to send specially crafted IP packets which could lead to a denial-of-service condition or remote code execution.\nCVE-2020-11896\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2020-11896. A base score of 7.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, CMIIT (6GT2701-5DB23), SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, ETSI (6GT2701-5DB03), SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, FCC (6GT2701-5DB13), SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4030G, ISED (6GT2701-5DB33), SIMATIC RTLS Gateway RTLS4430G, Chirp, ETSI, FCC, ISED, IP65 (6GT2701-5CB03): Currently no fix is planned. Implement Security recommendations according to the product manual\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-647068 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
