Juan\u00a0Vazquez of Rapid7 Inc.,Rapid7 Inc., http://www.rapid7.com, web site last accessed May 13, 2014. and independent researcher Julian Vilas Diaz reported to CERT/CC that they identified several vulnerabilities for the Yokogawa CENTUM CS 3000 application. In the investigation of this report, Yokogawa found other products that could also be affected. Please see the affected products below for the complete list. CERT/CC, NCCIC/ICS-CERT, and JPCERT have coordinated with Rapid7 and Yokogawa to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Yokogawa products are affected by all four vulnerabilities:\n\nCENTUM CS 1000 all revisions,\nCENTUM CS 3000 Entry Class R3.09.50 and earlier,\nCENTUM VP R5.03.00 and earlier,\nCENTUM VP Entry Class R5.03.00 and earlier,\nExaopc R3.71.02 and earlier,\nB/M9000CS R5.05.01 and earlier, and\nB/M9000 VP R7.03.01 and earlier.\n\nThe following Yokogawa products are affected only by the first vulnerability listed below:\n\nProSafe-RS R1.03.00 and earlier,\nExapilot R3.96.00 and earlier,\nExaplog R3.40.00 and earlier,\nExaquantum R2.02.50 to R2.80.00,\nExasmoc R4.03.20 and earlier,\nExarqe R4.03.20 and earlier,\nAAASuite R1.20.13 and earlier,\nPRM R3.11.20 and earlier,\nSTARDOM FCN/FCJ OPC Server for Windows R3.40.01 and earlier,\nField Wireless Device OPC Server R2.01.01 and earlier,\nDAQOPC R3.01 and earlier,\nFieldMate R1.03 and earlier,\nEJXMVTool R1.02.00 to R1.02.02,\nRPO Production Supervisor VP R1.03.00 and earlier,\nCENTUM Long-term Trend Historian all versions, and\nCENTUM Event Viewer Package all versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service (DoS) or potentially acquire system privileges to execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nYokogawa is a Japan-based company that maintains offices on several continents, including North and Central America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nCENTUM VP is an integrated production control system.\nExaopc is an OPC server for data access, alarms and events, historical data access, batch information, and a security interface for CENTUM series process control systems.\nB/M9000CS and B/M9000 VP are quality control systems for use in the pulp and paper industry.\nProSafe-RS is a PLC that functions as a distributed control system and a safety instrumented system.\nExapilot is an online navigation tool that guides operators step by step through plant operating procedures.\nExaplog is an event analysis package.\nExaquantum is a comprehensive plant information management system.\nExasmoc is a multi-variable control APC suite.\nExarqe is a software package designed to provide product quality signal as feedback to APC applications.\nAAASuite is an alarm management system.\nPRM is a plant asset management software tool that works with production control systems.\nSTARDOM is a network-based control system.\nField Wireless Device OPC Server provides data from a field wireless gateway to the OPC client via an OPC interface.\nFieldMate is a device management tool.\n\nAccording to Yokogawa, these products are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and others. Yokogawa estimates that these systems are deployed worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nHEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html, web site last accessed May 13, 2014.\n\nYokogawa\u2019s \u201cBKCLogSvr.exe\u201d service, started automatically with the system, listens by default on Port 52302/UDP. By sending a specially crafted sequence of packets to Port 52302/UDP, it is possible to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow after a usage of uninitialized data, which allows an attacker to DoS the BKCLogSvr.exe and could allow execution of arbitrary code with system privileges.\nCVE-2014-0781NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0781, web site last accessed May 13, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned by Yokogawa; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed May 13, 2014.\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, web site last accessed May 13, 2014.\n\nYokogawa\u2019s \u201cBKHOdeq.exe\u201d service, which started when running the FCS /Test Function, listens by default on Ports 20109/TCP, and 20171/TCP. By sending a specially crafted packet to Port 20171/TCP, it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the CENTUM user.\nCVE-2014-0783NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0783, web site last accessed May 13, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

For details about individual countermeasures by the affected product, please refer to Yokogawa\u2019s Security Advisory Report at the following location: http://www.yokogawa.com/dcs/security/ysar/dcs-ysar-index-en.htm.\nTo activate the patch software, the computer needs to be rebooted. In case the system uses earlier versions of the software, than the ones for which the software patches are provided, please upgrade to the revisions/versions as mentioned in the table in the Yokogawa Security Advisory Report and then apply for the software patches.\nYokogawa also suggests all customers introduce appropriate security measures to the overall system, not just for the vulnerabilities identified.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
