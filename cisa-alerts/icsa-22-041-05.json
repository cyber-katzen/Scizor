TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SICAM TOOLBOX II, a software platform, are affected:* SICAM TOOLBOX II: All versions### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [USE OF HARD\\-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE\\-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) Affected applications use an exploitable access control within a database service, which could allow an attacker to access the database.[CVE\\-2021\\-45106](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-45106)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Thomas Riedmaier from Siemens Energy, and Matan Dobrushin and Eran Jacob from OTORIO reported this vulnerability to Siemens.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** 5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following mitigation users can apply to reduce the risk:**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Restrict Port 1522/TCP access to localhost or specific IP addresses only, as documented in the updated security manual (chapter 3\\.6\\.7\\) included in the [SICAM TOOLBOX II v07\\.01 package](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109757707)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * The security manual is included within the [SICAM TOOLBOX II package](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109805672/sicam-toolbox-ii-v07-01-package?lc=en-ww)  that can be downloaded from SIOS. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  , and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-669737](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-669737.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
