ABB has produced new versions that mitigate this vulnerability. Mr. Sanchez has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ABB versions are affected:\n\nRobotStudio Version 5.60 up to and including 5.61.01.01, and\nTest Signal Viewer Version 1.5\n\nIMPACT\nThe vulnerability could allow an attacker who successfully exploits it to insert and run arbitrary code on an affected system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nABB is a company based in Switzerland that maintains offices in several countries around the world. ABB develops products in multiple critical sectors that are deployed worldwide.\nThe RobotStudio software is a PC product used for offline programming and simulation of ABB Robot system. The vulnerability exists in an executable file included in the product versions listed above. The Test Signal Viewer software is a PC product used for tuning motion parameters for external axes such as track motion and turning tables. According to ABB, these products are deployed across several industries including manufacturing, discrete automation, and others. ABB estimates that these products are used globally.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENTCWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html, web site last accessed November 04, 2014.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited when an executable file is executed during installation of RobotStudio to resolve the location of other DLLs to be dynamically loaded by a third-party component. The executable file has mistakenly been included, but not used in the distribution of all RobotStudio, Versions 5.60 up to and including 5.61.01.01.\nCVE-2014-5430NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5430, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed November 04, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, which in certain scenarios can cause it to load a dll file from an untrusted source.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nThe problem is corrected in the following product versions:\n\nRobotStudio Version 5.61.02, and\nTest Signal Viewer Version 1.6\n\nThese versions are available on the RobotWare 5.15.07.01 DVD and the RobotWare 5.61.02 DVD. The RobotWare 5.15.07.01 DVD and the RobotWare 5.61.02 DVD are available for download at the following hyperlink:\nhttp://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio/downloads\nABB recommends that customers apply the update as early as convenient. ABB has issued two Cyber Security Advisories providing further information. Please see the ABB Cyber Security Alerts & Notifications web page at:\nhttp://www.abb.com/cawp/abbzh254/2c9d1261d9fa1dcfc1257950002e4fbf.aspx\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed November 04, 2014. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed November 04, 2014. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
