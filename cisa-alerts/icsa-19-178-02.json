EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: ABB\nEquipment: CP651 HMI\nVulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to prevent legitimate access to an affected system node, remotely cause an affected system node to stop, take control of an affected system node, or insert and run arbitrary code in an affected system node.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\nABB reports the vulnerability affects the following CP651 HMI products:\nCP651, order code: 1SAP551100R0001, revision index B1 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP651-WEB, order code: 1SAP551200R0001, revision index A0 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP661, order code: 1SAP561100R0001, revision index B1 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP661-WEB, order code: 1SAP561200R0001, revision index A0 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP665, order code: 1SAP565100R0001, revision index B1 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP665-WEB, order code: 1SAP565200R0001, revision index A0 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP676, order code: 1SAP576100R0001, revision index B1 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior\nCP676-WEB, order code: 1SAP576200R0001, revision index A0 with BSP UN30 v1.76 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe ABB CP651 HMI component implements hidden administrative accounts that are used during the provisioning phase of the HMI interface.\nCVE-2019-10995 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nABB reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB recommends users apply the BSP update on affected CP600 control panels at their earliest convenience.\n\nNew version of PB610 Panel Builder 600 v2.8.0.424, which is provided via Automation Builder 2.2 SP2.\nNew version of BSP (board support package) UN30 v2.31.\n\nPlease see ABB cybersecurity advisory document number 3ADR010402 for more information about this vulnerability and two other security issues and their mitigations.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Only use software from trusted sources.\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
