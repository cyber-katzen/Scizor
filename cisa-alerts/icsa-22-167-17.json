MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating the products to the latest version of their software:* Siemens SINEMA Remote Connect Server: [Update to v3\\.1](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109811169)  or later The update of SINEMA Remote Connect Server to v3\\.1 also contains additional fixes for vulnerabilities documented in the following Siemens Security Advisories:* [SSA\\-244969](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-244969.html)* [SSA\\-539476](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-539476.html)* [SSA\\-685781](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-685781.html)* [SSA\\-712929](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-712929.html) For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, [contact Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html)  . As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-484086](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-484086.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
