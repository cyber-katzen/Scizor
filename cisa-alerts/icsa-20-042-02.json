MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends users update to the new version. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures until patches are available.* For IE/PB LINK PN IO, update to [v4\\.0\\.1](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109780330/)* For SCALANCE S602, SCALANCE S612, SCALANCE S623, and SCALANCE S627\\-2M products: Update to v4\\.1 (Update is only available via Siemens Support contact). Upgrade hardware to successor product from [SCALANCE SC\\-600 family](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109756957)**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update F Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * For SIMATIC NET CP 1623 the updated firmware is contained in [SIMATIC NET PC Software v14 Update 14](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775589/)  or later version or [SIMATIC NET PC Software v16](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109775589/)  or later version**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update F Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * For SIMATIC NET CP 1626, update to [v1\\.1\\.1](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109792924/)  or later version* For TIM 1531 IRC or SIPLUS NET variants, update to [Version 2\\.0](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109774204) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Disable SNMP if this is supported by the product (refer to the product documentation). Disabling SNMP fully mitigates these vulnerabilities.* Protect network access to Port 161/UDP of affected devices.* Apply cell protection concept and implement [defense\\-in\\-depth](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  .* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  , and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> . For more information on the vulnerabilities and detailed mitigation instructions, please see [Siemens security advisory SSA\\-978220](http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
