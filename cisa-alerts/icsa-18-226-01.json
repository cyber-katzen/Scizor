EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable locally/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal)\nVulnerabilities: Incorrect Default Permissions\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-18-226-01 Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 and SIMATIC WinCC that was published August 14, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with local file write access to manipulate files and cause a denial-of-service-condition, or execute code both on the manipulated installation as well as devices configured using the manipulated installation.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SIMATIC STEP 7 products:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v10, v11, v12: All versions,\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v13: All versions prior to v13 SP2 Update 2,\n\n--------- End\u00a0Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\n\nSIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v14: All versions < v14 SP1 Update 6, and\nSIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v15: All versions < v15 Update 2.\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nImproper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to insert specially crafted files, which may prevent TIA Portal startup (denial-of-service) or lead to local code execution. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to attempt to start TIA Portal after the manipulation.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-11453 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE-276\nImproper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to manipulate resources, which may be transferred to devices and executed there by a different user. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to transfer the manipulated files to a device. Execution is caused on the target device rather than on the PG device.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-11454 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni from Nozomi Networks reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\nSiemens recommends users of SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v10, v11, or v12 upgrade to v13 SP2 Update 2 to resolve these vulnerabilities:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109759753\nSiemens recommends users of SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v13, v14, or v15 update to the following versions to resolve these vulnerabilities:\n\nv13 SP2 Update 2\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109759753\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\n\nv14 SP1 Update 6\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109747387\n\nv15 Update 2\n\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109755826\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nRestrict operating system access to authorized personnel.\nValidate GSD files for legitimacy and process GSD files only from trusted sources.\n\nSiemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens also advises that users configure the operational environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-979106 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
