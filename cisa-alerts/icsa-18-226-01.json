EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n---------------------\n\n\n* **CVSS v3 8\\.6**\n* **ATTENTION:** \n Exploitable locally/low skill level to exploit\n* **Vendor:** \n Siemens\n* **Equipment:** \n SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal)\n* **Vulnerabilities:** \n Incorrect Default Permissions\n\n\n2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION\n----------------------\n\n\n\n This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-18\\-226\\-01 Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 and SIMATIC WinCC that was published August 14, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT website.\n \n\n\n3\\. RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with local file write access to manipulate files and cause a denial\\-of\\-service\\-condition, or execute code both on the manipulated installation as well as devices configured using the manipulated installation.\n \n\n\n4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n Siemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following SIMATIC STEP 7 products:\n \n\n\n* SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v10, v11, v12: All versions,\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n* SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v13: All versions prior to v13 SP2 Update 2,\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End\u00a0Update A Part 1 of 2 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n* SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v14: All versions \\< v14 SP1 Update 6, and\n* SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) v15: All versions \\< v15 Update 2\\.\n\n\n### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**4\\.2\\.1\n [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to insert specially crafted files, which may prevent TIA Portal startup (denial\\-of\\-service) or lead to local code execution. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to attempt to start TIA Portal after the manipulation.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2018\\-11453](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-11453) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**4\\.2\\.2\n [INCORRECT DEFAULT PERMISSIONS CWE\\-276](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to manipulate resources, which may be transferred to devices and executed there by a different user. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to transfer the manipulated files to a device. Execution is caused on the target device rather than on the PG device.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2018\\-11454](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-11454) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Germany\n\n\n### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Younes Dragoni from Nozomi Networks reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n \n\n\n5\\.
