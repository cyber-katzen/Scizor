This is accomplished by examining the installation log file when a nondefault service account and password are specified during installation or upgrade. This potentially leads to unauthorized shutdown of the affected PI services as well as potential reuse of domain credentials.\nMITIGATION\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nOSIsoft has released new versions of PI Vision 2017, PI Web API 2017, and PI AF Services 2017 SP1 install kit. These new versions address this issue for PI Coresight, PI Web API, and the PI AF Services integrated install kit.\nOSIsoft recommends that users follow the workaround detailed in the security bulletin until a software update can be applied. The security bulletin with detailed workaround can be found at:\nhttps://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00312\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. Not remotely exploitable. Low skill level is needed to exploit.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH SERVER LOG FILES CWE-533\n\nAn information exposure through server log files vulnerability has been identified, which may allow service account passwords to become exposed for the affected services, potentially leading to unauthorized shutdown of the affected PI services as well as potential reuse of domain credentials.\nCVE-2017-5153 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nVint Maggs from Savannah River Nuclear Solutions reported this issue to OSIsoft.\n",
