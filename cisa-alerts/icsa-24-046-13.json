EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low Attack Complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Parasolid\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Read, NULL Pointer Dereference\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens are affected:\n\nParasolid V35.0: all versions prior to V35.0.263\nParasolid V35.0: all versions prior to V35.0.251\nParasolid V35.1: all versions prior to V35.1.252\nParasolid V35.1: all versions prior to V35.1.170\nParasolid V36.0: all versions prior to V36.0.198\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted files containing XT format. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-49125\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2023-49125. A base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe affected applications contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing specially crafted XT files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial of service condition.\nCVE-2024-22043\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2023-49125. A base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions:\n\n\nParasolid V35.0: Update to V35.0.263 or\u00a0later version\n\n\nParasolid V35.1: Update to V35.1.252 or\u00a0later version\n\n\nParasolid V36.0: Update to V36.0.198 or\u00a0later version\n\n\nParasolid V35.0, Parasolid V35.1: Do not open untrusted XT files in Parasolid\n\n\nParasolid V35.0: Update to V35.0.251 or\u00a0later version\n\n\nParasolid V35.1: Update to V35.1.170 or\u00a0later version\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\n\nDo not open untrusted XT files in Parasolid.\n\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-797296 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
