A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE\\-2023\\-49125\\. A base score of 4\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:4\\.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions:* Parasolid V35\\.0: Update to V35\\.0\\.263 or [later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/258316782/)* Parasolid V35\\.1: Update to V35\\.1\\.252 or [later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/258316782/)* Parasolid V36\\.0: Update to V36\\.0\\.198 or [later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/258316782/)* Parasolid V35\\.0, Parasolid V35\\.1: Do not open untrusted XT files in Parasolid* Parasolid V35\\.0: Update to V35\\.0\\.251 or [later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/258316782/)* Parasolid V35\\.1: Update to V35\\.1\\.170 or [later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/258316782/)  Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Do not open untrusted XT files in Parasolid. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-797296 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-797296.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-797296.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
