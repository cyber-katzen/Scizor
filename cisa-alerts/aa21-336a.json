See the\n [ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) \n for referenced threat actor techniques and for mitigations.* \n\n\n\n\n This joint advisory is the result of analytic efforts between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to highlight the cyber threat associated with active exploitation of a newly identified vulnerability (CVE\\-2021\\-44077\\) in Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus\u2014IT help desk software with asset management.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2021\\-44077, which Zoho rated critical, is an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting all ServiceDesk Plus versions up to, and including, version 11305\\. This vulnerability was addressed by the update released by Zoho on September 16, 2021 for ServiceDesk Plus versions 11306 and above. The FBI and CISA assess that advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber actors are among those exploiting the vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to upload executable files and place webshells, which enable the adversary to conduct post\\-exploitation activities, such as compromising administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and exfiltrating registry hives and Active Directory files.\n \n\n\n\n The Zoho update that patched this vulnerability was released on September 16, 2021, along with a\n [security advisory](https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/security-advisory-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-servicedesk-plus-versions-11138-and-above) \n . Additionally, an email advisory was sent to all ServiceDesk Plus customers with additional information. Zoho released a\n [subsequent security advisory on November 22, 2021](https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/security-advisory-for-cve-2021-44077-unauthenticated-rce-vulnerability-in-servicedesk-plus-versions-up-to-11305-22-11-2021) \n , and advised customers to patch immediately.\n \n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA are aware of reports of malicious cyber actors likely using exploits against CVE\\-2021\\-44077 to gain access \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1190/) \n ] to ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus, as early as late October 2021\\. The actors have been observed using various tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including:\n \n\n\n* Writing webshells \\[\n [T1505\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1505/003/) \n ] to disk for initial persistence\n* Obfuscating and Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information \\[\n [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1027/) \n and\n [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1140/) \n ]\n* Conducting further operations to dump user credentials \\[\n [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1003/) \n ]\n* Living off the land by only using signed Windows binaries for follow\\-on actions \\[\n [T1218](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1218/) \n ]\n* Adding/deleting user accounts as needed \\[\n [T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1136/) \n ]\n* Stealing copies of the Active Directory database (\n `NTDS.dit` \n ) \\[\n [T1003\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1003/003/) \n ] or registry hives\n* Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for remote execution \\[\n [T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1047/) \n ]\n* Deleting files to remove indicators from the host \\[\n [T1070\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1070/004/) \n ]\n* Discovering domain accounts with the net Windows command \\[\n [T1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1087/002/) \n ]\n* Using Windows utilities to collect and archive files for exfiltration \\[\n [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1560/001/) \n ]\n* Using custom symmetric encryption for command and control (C2\\) \\[\n [T1573\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1573/001/) \n ]\n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA are proactively investigating this malicious cyber activity:\n \n\n\n* The FBI leverages specially trained cyber squads in each of its 56 field offices and CyWatch, the FBI\u2019s 24/7 operations center and watch floor, which provides around\\-the\\-clock support to track incidents and communicate with field offices across the country and partner agencies.\n* CISA offers a range of no\\-cost cyber hygiene services to help organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats. By requesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack vectors.\n\n\n\n Sharing technical and/or qualitative information with the FBI and CISA helps empower and amplify our capabilities as federal partners to collect and share intelligence and engage with victims, while working to unmask and hold accountable those conducting malicious cyber activities.\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/AA21-336A_APT_Actors_Exploiting_CVE-2021-44077_in_Zoho_ManageEngine_ServiceDesk_Plus.pdf) \n for a PDF version of this report.\n \n\n\n\n[Click here](/sites/default/files/AA21-336A%20APT%20Actors%20Exploiting%20CVE-2021-44077%20in%20Zoho%20ManageEngine%20ServiceDesk%20Plus.stix.xml) \n for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in STIX format.\n \n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n Compromise of the affected systems involves exploitation of CVE\\-2021\\-44077 in ServiceDesk Plus, allowing the attacker to:\n \n\n\n1. Achieve an unrestricted file upload through a POST request to the ServiceDesk REST API URL and upload an executable file,\n `C:\\ManageEngine\\Servicedesk\\bin\\msiexec.exe` \n , with a SHA256 hash of\n `ecd8c9967b0127a12d6db61964a82970ee5d38f82618d5db4d8eddbb3b5726b7` \n . This executable file serves as a dropper and contains an embedded, encoded Godzilla JAR file.\n2.
