EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 4\\.9*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Mendix* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to change the user\u2019s password bypassing password validations within a Mendix application.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Mendix, a high productivity app platform, are affected:* Mendix Applications using Mendix 7: All versions prior to v7\\.23\\.31* Mendix Applications using Mendix 8: All versions prior to v8\\.18\\.18* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9: All versions prior to v9\\.14\\.0* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9\\.6\\): All versions prior to v9\\.6\\.12* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (V9\\.12\\): All versions prior to v9\\.12\\.2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) In case of access to an active user session of a Mendix application built with an affected version, it\u2019s possible to change a user\u2019s password via bypassing password validations. This could allow an attacker to set weak passwords.[CVE\\-2022\\-31257](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-31257)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating to the latest version of its software and redeploying applications:* Mendix Applications using Mendix 7: Update Mendix Project to [v7\\.23\\.31 or later](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/7/)* Mendix Applications using Mendix 8: Update Mendix Project to [v8\\.18\\.18 or later](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/8/)* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9: Update Mendix Project to [v9\\.14 or later](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/9/)* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (v9\\.6\\): Update Mendix Project to [v9\\.6\\.12](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.6/)  or later (preferably to the latest v9\\.12 version).* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (v9\\.12\\): Update Mendix Project to [v9\\.12\\.2](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.12/)  or later As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 [Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-433782](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-433782.pdf)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
