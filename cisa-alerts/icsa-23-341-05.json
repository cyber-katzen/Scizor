EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.5*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : ControlByWeb* **Equipment**  : X\\-332 and X\\-301* **Vulnerability**  : Cross\\-Site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to run malicious code during a user's session.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of ControlByWeb Relay are affected:* X\\-332\\-24I: Firmware 1\\.06* X\\-301\\-I: Firmware 1\\.15* X\\-301\\-24I: Firmware 1\\.15### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)** The affected ControlByWeb Relay products are vulnerable to a stored cross\\-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the endpoint of a web interface that could run malicious javascript code during a user's session.[CVE\\-2023\\-6333](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-6333)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Prajitesh Singh of Cyble reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- ControlByWeb recommends users update to the following versions:* [X301 V1\\.20](https://controlbyweb.com/firmware/X301_v1.20_firmware.zip)  .* [X332 V1\\.09](https://controlbyweb.com/firmware/X332_v1.09_firmware.zip)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
