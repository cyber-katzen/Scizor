GE has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability.\nGE has released a security advisory (GEIP13-03) available on the GE Intelligent Platforms support Web site to inform customers about this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GE CIMPLICITY versions are affected:\n\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY: Version 4.01 to 8.2, and\nProficy Process Systems with CIMPLICITY.\n\nIMPACT\nIf the vulnerability is exploited, it could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the CIMPLICITY WebView and/or CIMPLITY built-in Web server to crash, or to run arbitrary commands on a server running the affected software, or could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the CIMPLICITY server.\nAn attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious messages over a TCP connection to the listening service. The attacks do not require authentication and can be conducted remotely. The vulnerable components are not enabled by default.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to GE, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY is a Client/Server-based human-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) application, which is deployed across multiple industries.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed July\u00a0 30, 2013.\n\nThe CimWebServer does not properly validate inputted information. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could crash the WebView or built-in Web server, run arbitrary commands on a server running the affected software, or take control of the server. The vulnerable CIMPLICITY built-in Web server component is not enabled by default.\nCVE-2013-2785NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2785, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C, Web site last accessed July\u00a0 30, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE has released the following product updates that resolve this vulnerability:\n\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY 8.2 SIM 19\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY 8.1 SIM 25\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY 8.0 SIM 27\n\nAll the updates can be found at:\nhttp://support.ge-ip.com/support/index?page=kbchannel&id=KB15602\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth StrategiesCSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed July\u00a0 30, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation StrategiesTargeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed July\u00a0 30, 2013., that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
