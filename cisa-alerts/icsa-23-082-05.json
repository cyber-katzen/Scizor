EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.3\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0ABB\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Pulsar Plus Controller \u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take control of the product or execute arbitrary code. \u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ABB Pulsar Plus Controller, are affected:\u00a0\n\nABB Infinity DC Power Plant \u2013 H5692448 G104 G842 G224L G630-4 G451C(2) G461(2) \u2013 comcode 150047415\u00a0\nABB Pulsar Plus System Controller \u2013 NE843_S \u2013 comcode 150042936\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\u00a0\nThere are several fields in the web pages where a user can enter arbitrary text, such as a description of an alarm or a rectifier. These represent a cross site scripting vulnerability where JavaScript code can be entered as the description with the potential of causing system interactions unknown to the user. These issues were remediated by adding a check of every field update to reject suspicious entries.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-1607\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0USE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE-330\u00a0\nEvery interaction with the web server requires a Session ID that is assigned to the session after a successful login. The reported vulnerability is that the Session IDs were too short (16 bits), too predictable (IDs simply incremented), and were plainly visible in the URLs of the web pages. These issues were remediated by rewriting the web server to follow recommended best practices. \u00a0\nCVE-2022-26080\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVlad Ionescu of Facebook Red Team X reported these vulnerabilities to ABB.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB has an available update resolving a privately reported vulnerability in the product versions listed above. The update is version number 5.0.0 for the application and 5.0.0 for web pages. These updates have been distributed through the appropriate product support channels with affected users. \u00a0\nABB recommends users ensure the firewall protection is properly configured.\u00a0\nA workaround suggested by ABB is to use the controller\u2019s Read/Write Enable/Disable feature for a network port (NET1,WRE=0). \u00a0\nThe controller can disable all writes over the network port. The factory default is to have the write capability enabled. However, some users may not want settings to be remotely changed once systems are set. This feature, when set to \u201cDisable\u201d, will allow no changes to be accepted. Once set, it can only be changed locally through the front panel. \u00a0\nAlthough these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they can help block known attack vectors. \u00a0\nFor more information, see\u00a0ABB Security Advisory. \u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0\n",
