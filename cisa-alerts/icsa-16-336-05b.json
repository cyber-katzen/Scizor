This vulnerability was identified by Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies. GE has produced new versions to mitigate this vulnerability.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following GE products are affected:\n \n\n\n* Proficy HMI/SCADA iFIX Version 5\\.8 SIM 13 and prior versions,\n* Proficy HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY Version 9\\.0 and prior versions, and\n* Proficy Historian Version 6\\.0 and prior versions.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to retrieve user passwords.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n GE is a US\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\n \n\n\n\n The affected product, Proficy HMI/SCADA iFIX, is a HMI/SCADA application. Proficy HMI/SCADA\\-CIMPLICITY is a client/server\\-based HMI/SCADA application. Proficy Historian is a data historian that collects, archives, and distributes production information. According to GE, these products are deployed across multiple sectors worldwide. They are sold by GE Digital, GE\u2019s Automation and Control business, and by GE\u2019s resellers and distributors. GE estimates that these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE\\-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522\\.html, web site last accessed January 17, 2017\\.\n\n\n\n\n An attacker may be able to retrieve user passwords if he or she has access to an authenticated session.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2016\\-9360NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-9360, web site last accessed May 18, 2017\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed January 17, 2017\\.\n \n\n\n### VULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\n\n#### EXPLOITABILITY\n\n\n\n This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction.\n \n\n\n#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability\n *.* \n\n\n\n#### DIFFICULTY\n\n\n\n An attacker with high skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n GE has released new product versions with new product names to address the identified vulnerability in the affected products. GE has released the iFIX software, Version 5\\.8 SIM 14, which is available at the following location with a valid account:\n \n\n\n\n[https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/cc\\_login?startURL\\=%2Fen\\_US%2FDownload%2FiFIX\\-5\\-8\\-Service\\-Pack\\-2](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/cc_login?startURL=%2Fen_US%2FDownload%2FiFIX-5-8-Service-Pack-2) \n\n\n\n\n GE has also released a new version of the CIMPLICITY software, Version 9\\.5, and the Historian, Version 7\\.0, which are available by contacting a GE Digital representative.

For users unable to upgrade to GE HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY 9\\.5, the following steps may mitigate the risks described above:\n \n\n\n* Enable project configuration security and limit the number of users that have access to the workbench to only those that need to configure the project.\n* Enable Windows domain authentication so that CIMPLICITY users\u2019 passwords are not stored in CIMPLICITY.\n\n\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update B Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** \n\n\n\n\n GE\u2019s Product Bulletin is available at the following URL:\n \n\n\n\n[https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en\\_US/Article/GE\\-Digital\\-Security\\-Advisory\\-GED\\-16\\-02](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/GE-Digital-Security-Advisory-GED-16-02) \n\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page.
