This vulnerability was identified by Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies. GE has produced new versions to mitigate this vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GE products are affected:\n\nProficy HMI/SCADA iFIX Version 5.8 SIM 13 and prior versions,\nProficy HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY Version 9.0 and prior versions, and\nProficy Historian Version 6.0 and prior versions.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to retrieve user passwords.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGE is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected product, Proficy HMI/SCADA iFIX, is a HMI/SCADA application. Proficy HMI/SCADA-CIMPLICITY is a client/server-based HMI/SCADA application. Proficy Historian is a data historian that collects, archives, and distributes production information. According to GE, these products are deployed across multiple sectors worldwide. They are sold by GE Digital, GE\u2019s Automation and Control business, and by GE\u2019s resellers and distributors. GE estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html, web site last accessed January 17, 2017.\n\nAn attacker may be able to retrieve user passwords if he or she has access to an authenticated session.\nCVE-2016-9360NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9360, web site last accessed May 18, 2017. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed January 17, 2017.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with high skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE has released new product versions with new product names to address the identified vulnerability in the affected products. GE has released the iFIX software, Version 5.8 SIM 14, which is available at the following location with a valid account:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/cc_login?startURL=%2Fen_US%2FDownload%2FiFIX-5-8-Service-Pack-2\nGE has also released a new version of the CIMPLICITY software, Version 9.5, and the Historian, Version 7.0, which are available by contacting a GE Digital representative. Contact information for GE is available at the following location:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/CC_Contact\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 1 --------\nGE has released new versions of the Historian software, Version 6.0 SIM 9 (Standard and Enterprise):\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/Historian-Standard-6-0-SP1-SIM-9\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/Historian-Enterprise-6-0-SP1-SIM-9\nGE has released a new version of the Historian software, Version 5.5 SIM 37:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/Historian-5-5-SIM-37\nGE has released a new version of the HMI/SCADA iFIX 5.8 SIM 14:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Download/iFIX-5-8-Service-Pack-2\nGE has released a new version of the HMI/SCADA iFIX software, Version 5.5. iFIX users with versions earlier than Version 5.5 who cannot upgrade can call GE Support.\nGE has released a new version of the CIMPLICITY software, Version 8.2 SIM 49:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/CIMPLICITY-8-2-SIM-49\nGE has released a new version of the CIMPLICITY software, Version 9.0 SIM 22:\nhttps://ge-ip.force.com/communities/en_US/Download/CIMPLICITY-9-0-SIM-22\nGE Digital recommends that all users upgrade to GE HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY 9.5. For users unable to upgrade to GE HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY 9.5, the following steps may mitigate the risks described above:\n\nEnable project configuration security and limit the number of users that have access to the workbench to only those that need to configure the project.\nEnable Windows domain authentication so that CIMPLICITY users\u2019 passwords are not stored in CIMPLICITY.\n\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 ----------\nGE\u2019s Product Bulletin is available at the following URL:\nhttps://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/GE-Digital-Security-Advisory-GED-16-02\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
