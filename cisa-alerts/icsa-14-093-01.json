[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric OPC Factory Server Buffer Overflow===================================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-093\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Researcher Wei Gao, formerly of IXIA, has identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Schneider Electric OPC Factory Server (OFS) application. Schneider Electric has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability. Wei Gao has tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Schneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of OFS:* TLXCDSUOFS33 \u2013 V3\\.5 and previous,* TLXCDSTOFS33 \u2013 V3\\.5 and previous,* TLXCDLUOFS33 \u2013 V3\\.5 and previous,* TLXCDLTOFS33 \u2013 V3\\.5 and previous, and* TLXCDLFOFS33 \u2013 V3\\.5 and previous.IMPACT------ A successful exploitation will cause the server to reboot resulting in a denial of service. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Schneider Electric corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide. These products are industrial active energy management control products, deployed across several sectors including the Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities, Food and Agriculture, and Transportation Systems. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and North America.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-122: Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122\\.html, web site last accessed April 03, 2014\\. Incorrect parsing in the OPC Automation 2\\.0 Server Object (ActiveX) can result in a buffer overflow error. The vulnerability is caused by parsing long arguments in functions.

For more information regarding this issue, please see the security announcements affecting the OPC Factory Server on Schneider Electric\u2019s web site at the following URL:[http://www2\\.schneider\\-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page](http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page)  ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
