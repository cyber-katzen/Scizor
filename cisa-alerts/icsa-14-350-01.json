These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researchers Ariele Caltabiano, Andrea Micalizzi, and Brian Gorenc. Schneider Electric has produced an update version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ProClima versions are affected:\n\nProClima Version 6.0.1 and previous.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessfully exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, ProClima, is a configuration utility used to design control panel enclosures to accommodate the thermal load from the electrical/electronic devices inside and from the environment. According to Schneider Electric, ProClima is used across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Energy. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCOMMAND INJECTIONCWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html, web site last accessed December 16, 2014.\n\nMDraw30.ocx control can be initialized and called by malicious scripts potentially causing buffer overflows, which may allow an attacker to execute code remotely.\nCVE-2014-8513NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8513, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Customers are encouraged to download the new version and update their installations. It is important that customers first uninstall the current version. The new version can be downloaded from Schneider Electric\u2019s web site at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/ProClima_software\nFor further information on these vulnerabilities, please see Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification (SEVD 2014-344-01) at Schneider Electric\u2019s cybersecurity web page:\nhttp://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cyber-security-vulnerabilities-sorted.page \nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
