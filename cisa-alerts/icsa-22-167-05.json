[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens EN100 Ethernet Module============================= Last Revised June 16, 2022 Alert Code ICSA\\-22\\-167\\-051\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  EN100 Ethernet Module* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the product crashing or the creation of a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of EN100 Ethernet Module are affected:* EN100 Ethernet module DNP3 IP variant: all versions* EN100 Ethernet module IEC 104 variant: all versions* EN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant: all versions prior to v4\\.37* EN100 Ethernet module Modbus TCP variant: all versions* EN100 Ethernet module PROFINET IO variant: all versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) The affected applications contain a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing specially crafted HTTP packets to /txtrace endpoint. This could allow an attacker to crash the affected application, leading to a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-30937](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30937)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Messner from Siemens Energy reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends updating products, where possible, to the following versions:* EN100 Ethernet module DNP3 IP variant: No fix is currently planned* EN100 Ethernet module IEC 104 variant: No fix is currently planned* EN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant: update to [v4\\.37](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109745821/)  or later* EN100 Ethernet module Modbus TCP variant: No fix is currently planned* EN100 Ethernet module PROFINET IO variant: No fix is currently planned Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:* Disable web service within the device configuration if it is not used* Block access to Port 80/TCP and 443/TCP (e.g., with an external firewall)* Apply secure substation concept and [Defense\\-in\\-Depth](https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity)  or contact customer care to find specific solutions Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals.
