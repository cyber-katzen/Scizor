EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: EN100 Ethernet Module\nVulnerability: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the product crashing or the creation of a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of EN100 Ethernet Module are affected:\n\nEN100 Ethernet module DNP3 IP variant: all versions\nEN100 Ethernet module IEC 104 variant: all versions\nEN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant: all versions prior to v4.37\nEN100 Ethernet module Modbus TCP variant: all versions\nEN100 Ethernet module PROFINET IO variant: all versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe affected applications contain a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing specially crafted HTTP packets to /txtrace endpoint. This could allow an attacker to crash the affected application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2022-30937 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner from Siemens Energy reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends updating products, where possible, to the following versions:\n\nEN100 Ethernet module DNP3 IP variant: No fix is currently planned\nEN100 Ethernet module IEC 104 variant: No fix is currently planned\nEN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant: update to \u00a0v4.37 or later\nEN100 Ethernet module Modbus TCP variant: No fix is currently planned\nEN100 Ethernet module PROFINET IO variant: No fix is currently planned\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nDisable web service within the device configuration if it is not used\nBlock access to Port 80/TCP and 443/TCP (e.g., with an external firewall)\nApply secure substation concept and Defense-in-Depth or contact customer care to find specific solutions\n\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-693555\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
