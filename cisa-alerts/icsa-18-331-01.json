EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\n\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: AVEVA Software, LLC (AVEVA)\nEquipment: Vijeo Citect, Citect SCADA\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAVEVA reports that a vulnerability in Schneider Electric Software Update utility versions prior to v2.2.0 affects the following AVEVA products:\n\nVijeo Citect v7.40,\nVijeo Citect 2015,\nCitect SCADA v7.40,\nCitect SCADA 2015, and\nCitect SCADA 2016\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources. An attacker with local access could place a specially crafted file on the target machine, which may give the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2018-7799 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAVEVA reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA recommends all affected users download and upgrade to the latest version of the Schneider Electric Software Update (SESU) software.\nhttps://www.update.schneider-electric.com/download/SystemConsistency/SoftwareUpdate/SESU_220/SESU_2.2.0_setup_sfx.exe\nAVEVA\u2019s Security Advisory can be viewed at:\nhttps://sw.aveva.com/hubfs/assets-2018/pdf/security-bulletin/SecurityAdvisory_LFSec134.pdf\nAVEVA recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices, such as:\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nPhysical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment or the ICS and safety networks.\nAll controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\nAll programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended.\nAll methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nLaptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. \u00a0\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
