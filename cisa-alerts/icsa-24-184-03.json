TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nICONICS reports that the following versions of ICONICS Product Suite are affected:\n\nICONICS Suite including GENESIS64, Hyper Historian, AnalytiX, and MobileHMI: Version 10.97.2 (CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-4807)\nAlarmWorX Multimedia (AlarmWorX64 MMX): All versions prior to 10.97.3 (CVE-2024-1182)\nMobileHMI: All versions prior to 10.97.3 (CVE-2024-1573)\nICONICS Suite including GENESIS64, Hyper Historian, AnalytiX, and MobileHMI: All versions prior to 10.97.3 (CVE-2024-1574)\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling CWE-770\nA denial-of-service vulnerability due to an allocation of resources without limits or throttling.\nCVE-2023-2650 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 3.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.2 Improper Neutralization CWE-707\nA bug in OpenSSL that might corrupt the internal state of the application on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.\nCVE-2023-4807 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3 Uncontrolled Search Path Element CWE-427\nAn uncontrolled search path element in the AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager agent can provide the potential for DLL hijacking.\nCVE-2024-1182 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4 Improper Authentication CWE-287\nThe GENESIS64 Automatic Login feature, when used with MobileHMI in a certain specific condition, can result in improper privileges being given to a non-logged-in user.\nCVE-2024-1573 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.5 Unsafe Reflection CWE-470\nUse of externally-controlled input to select classes or code (\u2018Unsafe Reflection') condition in the licensing service (used by ICONICS licensing) can result in an improper authorization condition.\nCVE-2024-1574 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: ICONICS is headquartered in the United States. Mitsubishi Electric is headquartered in Japan.\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAsher Davila of Palo Alto Networks reported AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager Agent vulnerability to ICONICS.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nVersions 10.97.3 and later have mitigations for these vulnerabilities. ICONICS recommends that users of its products take the following mitigation steps:\n\nUse the 10.97.3 version.\nIf planning to use the AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager agent, follow the guidelines provided in the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities June 2024 edition.\n\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommends updating the ICONICS Suite with the latest security patches as they become available. ICONICS Suite security patches may be found here (login required).\nICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric is releasing security updates as critical fixes/rollup releases. Refer to the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities, the most recent version of which can be found here, and to the Mitsubishi Electric security advisory for information on the availability of the security updates.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJuly 2, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
