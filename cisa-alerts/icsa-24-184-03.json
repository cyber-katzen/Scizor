Mitsubishi Electric is headquartered in Japan.### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Asher Davila of Palo Alto Networks reported AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager Agent vulnerability to ICONICS.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Versions 10\\.97\\.3 and later have mitigations for these vulnerabilities. ICONICS recommends that users of its products take the following mitigation steps:* Use the 10\\.97\\.3 version.* If planning to use the AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager agent, follow the guidelines provided in the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities June 2024 edition. ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommends updating the ICONICS Suite with the latest security patches as they become available. ICONICS Suite security patches may be found [here](https://partners.iconics.com/Home.aspx)  (login required). ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric is releasing security updates as critical fixes/rollup releases. Refer to the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities, the most recent version of which can be found [here](https://iconics.com/About/Security/CERT)  , and to the [Mitsubishi Electric security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2024-004_en.pdf)  for information on the availability of the security updates. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.5\\.
