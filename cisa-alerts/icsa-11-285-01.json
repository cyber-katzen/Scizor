  "markdown": "\nOverview\nIndustrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) received a report from independent security researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle concerning a vulnerability affecting Honeywell Enterprise Buildings Integrator (EBI) software systems that have Temaline physical access control products installed. Temaline client products use the Tema Remote Installer to download and install required Tema components for client workstation access.\nTema Remote Installer uses DownloadURL() ActiveX function configured to ignore file authentication. This misuse of an ActiveX function allows download and installation of any MSI file without checking source authenticity or user notification.\nICS-CERT has coordinated this vulnerability report with Honeywell and the researchers. Honeywell has released two patches resolving this vulnerability. ICS-CERT has validated that these patches resolve the reported vulnerability.\nAffected Products\nAccording to Honeywell, the following EBI product versions are affected:\n\nEBI R310.1 - TEMA 4.8\nEBI R310.1 - TEMA 4.9\nEBI R310.1 - TEMA 4.10\nEBI R400.2 SP1 - TEMA 5.2\nEBI R410.1 - TEMA 5.3.0\nEBI R410.2 - TEMA 5.3.1.\n\nImpact\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in the ability to execute arbitrary code on the targeted human-machine interface system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nHoneywell EBI is a building system integration software product sold globally by Honeywell Building Solutions and Honeywell Process Solutions. Building operators and facility engineers use EBI to control HVAC, physical security, life safety and energy systems. The EBI software monitors alarms and events and allows for system configuration and administration as required.\nThe TEMA Remote Installer is an automated software installation tool provided by Honeywell to support installation of Temaline workstation clients.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nThe TEMA Remote Installer contains an ActiveX control that exposes a method that allows execution of arbitrary code. If a specially crafted MSI file renamed \u201cThinClient_TemaKit.msi\u201d is downloaded using Honeywell\u2019s TEMA Remote Installer, the file will be silently installed on the target machine. This specially crafted MSI file could then alter the functionality and control of the running EBI system and enable other unauthorized remote actions. The implementation of this ActiveX control does not verify the origin of the MSI file, allowing an attacker to craft an MSI file that can be downloaded and silently installed on the target machine.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo public exploits are known that specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would require moderate skill.\nMitigation\nHoneywell has produced a patch that resolves this vulnerability which can be acquired by contacting their regional Security Technical Consultant. Contact information is provided below. Honeywell recommends this update be applied to all systems running affected versions of the EBI system regardless of current connection status to the Internet.\nICS-CERT has confirmed the vendor patch resolves the reported vulnerability. The patched ActiveX controls do not allow the legitimate ThinClient_TemaKit.msi to be downloaded. Any future clients requiring the ThinClient_TemaKit.msi to be installed should follow the installation instructions as specified in the update notice.\nHoneywell Building Solutions (HBS) customers with impacted EBI products should contact their local service account manager to arrange for updates to be applied by HBS service technicians. The update should be applied to:\n\nAll EBI Server computers\nAll EBI client computers that have had Station Client and Temaline Web Clients installed.\nAll computers that have had Temaline Web Reception installed.\n\nHoneywell Process Solutions customers with impacted EBI products should contact their appropriate regional Industrial Security Technical Consultant from the following list:\n\nPacific Region\u2014Ajay Varghese +61 738 406493\nEMEA Region\u2014Suresh Vijayakumar +971 56 6164177\nNorth America\u2014Mike Torbett +1 713 5400408\nLatin America Region\u2014Alejandro Giudici +54 911 59436195\n\nIn addition to applying the patch available, ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take further defensive measures to lower their risk to the possible exploitation of this and other cybersecurity risks.\nSpecifically, ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.In addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
