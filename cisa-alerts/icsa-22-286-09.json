This could allow an attacker to take over another user\u2019s session after login.\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\nCVE-2022-40226 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF PARAMETER/ARGUMENT DELIMITERS CWE-141\n--------- Begin Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\nAffected SICAM P850 and P855 devices versions prior to 3.10 do not properly validate the parameter of a specific GET request. This could allow an unauthenticated user to set the device to a denial-of-service state or to control the program counter and execute arbitrary code on the device.\n--------- End Update A part 2 of 2 ---------\nCVE-2022-41665 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Messner of Siemens Energy reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:\u00a0\n\nSICAM P850 devices: Update to v3.10 or later\nSICAM P855 devices: Update to v3.10 or later\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAvoid accessing links from untrusted sources while logged in to SICAM P850 or SICAM P855 devices\n\nSiemens recommends operators check for appropriate resilient protection measures; the risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can be minimized by virtue of the grid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated application of security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends users to validate any security update before application; Siemens recommends the update process be supervised by trained staff in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms, such as firewalls, network segmentation, or use of virtual private networks (VPNs). It is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nFor additional resources, users should review Siemens\u2019 security guidelines.\nFor more information, see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-572005 in HTML or CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
