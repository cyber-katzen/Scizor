MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:* SICAM P850 devices: [Update to v3\\.10](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109743594/)  or later* SICAM P855 devices: [Update to v3\\.10](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109743621/)  or later Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Avoid accessing links from untrusted sources while logged in to SICAM P850 or SICAM P855 devices Siemens recommends operators check for appropriate resilient protection measures; the risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can be minimized by virtue of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated application of security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends users to validate any security update before application; Siemens recommends the update process be supervised by trained staff in the target environment. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms, such as firewalls, network segmentation, or use of virtual private networks (VPNs). It is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines to run the devices in a protected IT environment.
