This method relies on a feature named Application Password. Once enabled, password-based authentication is required whenever a user connects to change their application program;\nEnable protection relying on an input (M340, Premium, Quantum) or a key switch in the front panel (Quantum) to reject remote connection or run/stop commands; and\nEnable the \u201cAccess Control List protection,\u201d where users are able to configure the restricted IP addresses that are pre-authorized to control the PLC.\n\nFor additional information, Schneider Electric has released a Cybersecurity Notification, which is available at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-065-01/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\n\nSensitive information is transmitted in cleartext in the Modicon Modbus protocol, which may allow an attacker to replay the following commands: run, stop, upload, and download.\nCVE-2017-6034 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n\nVIOLATION OF SECURE DESIGN PRINCIPLES CWE-657\n\nThe Modicon Modbus protocol has a session-related weakness making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.\nCVE-2017-6032 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nEran Goldstein of CRITIFENCE reported the identified vulnerabilities.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Defense Industrial Base, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Paris, France\n\u00a0\n",
