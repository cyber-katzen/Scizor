MITIGATIONS--------------- Hillrom has released software updates for all impacted devices to address these vulnerabilities. New product versions that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available as follows:* Welch Allyn ELI 380 Resting Electrocardiograph: available by Q4 2023* Welch Allyn ELI 280/BUR280/MLBUR 280 Resting Electrocardiograph: available May 2022* Welch Allyn ELI 150c/BUR 150c/MLBUR 150c Resting Electrocardiograph: available by Q4 2023 Hillrom recommends users upgrade to the latest product versions. Information on how to update these products can be found on the [Hillrom disclosure page](https://hillrom.com/en/responsible-disclosures/)  . Hillrom recommends the following workarounds to help reduce risk:* Apply proper network and physical security controls.* Ensure a unique encryption key is configured for ELI Link and Cardiograph.* Where possible, use a firewall to prevent communication on Port 21 FTP service, Port 22 SSH (Secure Shell Connection), and Port 23 Telnet service. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
