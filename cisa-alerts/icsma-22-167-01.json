Welch Allyn, and ELI are registered trademarks of Baxter International, Inc., or its subsidiaries.\nEquipment: Welch Allyn medical devices\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Password, Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise software security by executing commands, gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, evading detection, etc.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Hillrom products, are affected:\n\nWelch Allyn ELI 380 Resting Electrocardiograph: Versions 2.6.0 and prior\nWelch Allyn ELI 280/BUR280/MLBUR 280 Resting Electrocardiograph: Versions 2.3.1 and prior\nWelch Allyn ELI 250c/BUR 250c Resting Electrocardiograph: Versions 2.1.2 and prior\nWelch Allyn ELI 150c/BUR 150c/MLBUR 150c Resting Electrocardiograph: Versions 2.2.0 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nThe affected products contain hard-coded (unchangeable) passwords used for inbound authentication or outbound communication to external components.\nCVE-2022-26388 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\nCVE-2022-26389 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAn anonymous user reported these vulnerabilities to Hillrom.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHillrom has released software updates for all impacted devices to address these vulnerabilities. New product versions that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available as follows:\n\nWelch Allyn ELI 380 Resting Electrocardiograph: available by Q4 2023\nWelch Allyn ELI 280/BUR280/MLBUR 280 Resting Electrocardiograph: available May 2022\nWelch Allyn ELI 150c/BUR 150c/MLBUR 150c Resting Electrocardiograph: available by Q4 2023\n\nHillrom recommends users upgrade to the latest product versions. Information on how to update these products can be found on the Hillrom disclosure page.\nHillrom recommends the following workarounds to help reduce risk:\n\nApply proper network and physical security controls.\nEnsure a unique encryption key is configured for ELI Link and Cardiograph.\nWhere possible, use a firewall to prevent communication on Port 21 FTP service, Port 22 SSH (Secure Shell Connection), and Port 23 Telnet service.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
