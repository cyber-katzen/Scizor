EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: Logix Controllers\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an unauthorized user to send malicious messages to the targeted device, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nRockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following Logix Controllers:\u00a0\n\nCompactLogix 5380 controllers: firmware Versions 32.013 and earlier\nCompact GuardLogix 5380 controllers: firmware Versions 32.013 and earlier\nCompactLogix 5480 controllers: firmware Versions 32.013 and earlier\nControlLogix 5580 controllers: firmware Versions 32.013 and earlier\nGuardLogix 5580 controllers: firmware Versions 32.013 and earlier\nCompactLogix 5370 controllers: firmware Versions 33.013 and earlier\nCompact GuardLogix 5370 controllers: firmware Versions 33.013 and earlier\nControlLogix 5570 controllers: firmware Versions 33.013 and earlier\nGuardLogix 5570 controllers: firmware Versions 33.013 and earlier\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nA malformed Class 3 common industrial protocol message with a cached connection can cause a denial-of-service condition, resulting in a major nonrecoverable fault. If the target device becomes unavailable, a user would have to clear the fault and redownload the user project file to bring the device back online.\nCVE-2022-1797 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation discovered this vulnerability during routine security testing and reported it to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation recommends users update to the latest firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability. Users are directed towards the risk mitigation provided below and are encouraged (where possible) to combine these with the general security guidelines below to employ multiple strategies simultaneously. Users should go to Rockwell Automation's Product Compatibility & Download Center to download the latest firmware.\n\nCompactLogix 5380, Compact GuardLogix 5380, CompactLogix 5480, ControlLogix 5580, GuardLogix 5580: Upgrade to v33.011 firmware\nCompactLogix 5370, Compact GuardLogix 5370, ControlLogix 5570, GuardLogix 5570: Upgrade to v34.011 firmware\n\nIf upgrading is not possible, Rockwell Automation recommends the following mitigations:\n\nUse of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with products from Rockwell Automation is available in Knowledgebase article QA17329.\nConfirm the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.\n\nRockwell Automation general security guidelines:\n\nUse trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and confirm they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, see Knowledgebase article PN715.\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as connected devices.\nPlease see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory PN1596 for more information.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
