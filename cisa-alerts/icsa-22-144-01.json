EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely* **Vendor:**  Rockwell Automation* **Equipment:**  Logix Controllers* **Vulnerability:**  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an unauthorized user to send malicious messages to the targeted device, which could lead to a denial\\-of\\-service condition.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Rockwell Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following Logix Controllers:* CompactLogix 5380 controllers: firmware Versions 32\\.013 and earlier* Compact GuardLogix 5380 controllers: firmware Versions 32\\.013 and earlier* CompactLogix 5480 controllers: firmware Versions 32\\.013 and earlier* ControlLogix 5580 controllers: firmware Versions 32\\.013 and earlier* GuardLogix 5580 controllers: firmware Versions 32\\.013 and earlier* CompactLogix 5370 controllers: firmware Versions 33\\.013 and earlier* Compact GuardLogix 5370 controllers: firmware Versions 33\\.013 and earlier* ControlLogix 5570 controllers: firmware Versions 33\\.013 and earlier* GuardLogix 5570 controllers: firmware Versions 33\\.013 and earlier### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) A malformed Class 3 common industrial protocol message with a cached connection can cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, resulting in a major nonrecoverable fault. If the target device becomes unavailable, a user would have to clear the fault and redownload the user project file to bring the device back online.[CVE\\-2022\\-1797](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1797)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation discovered this vulnerability during routine security testing and reported it to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation recommends users update to the latest firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability. Users are directed towards the risk mitigation provided below and are encouraged (where possible) to combine these with the general security guidelines below to employ multiple strategies simultaneously. Users should go to Rockwell Automation's [Product Compatibility \\& Download Center](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/home.aspx)  to download the latest firmware.* CompactLogix 5380, Compact GuardLogix 5380, CompactLogix 5480, ControlLogix 5580, GuardLogix 5580: Upgrade to v33\\.011 firmware* CompactLogix 5370, Compact GuardLogix 5370, ControlLogix 5570, GuardLogix 5570: Upgrade to v34\\.011 firmware If upgrading is not possible, Rockwell Automation recommends the following mitigations:* Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with products from Rockwell Automation is available in [Knowledgebase article QA17329](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/546989)  .* Confirm the least\\-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed. Rockwell Automation general security guidelines:* Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and confirm they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, see [Knowledgebase article PN715](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1135559)  .* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as connected devices.* Please see Rockwell Automation\u2019s security advisory [PN1596](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1135559)  for more information.
