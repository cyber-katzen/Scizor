RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause services to crash and restart.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nABB reports that the vulnerability only affects 800xA services in PC based client/server nodes. Controllers are not affected by this vulnerability:\n\nABB 800xA Base: versions 6.1.1-2 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Improper Input Validation CWE-20\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause services to crash and restart by sending specifically crafted messages.\nCVE-2024-3036 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3036. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nUri Sade, Roman Dvorkin, Ariel Harush, Eran Jacob, and Roni Gavrilov from OTORIO reported these vulnerabilities to ABB.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB recommends updating to an active product version to obtain the latest corrections. The problem is or will be corrected in the following product versions:\n\nABB 800xA Base 6.2.0-0 (part of System 800xA 6.2.0.0)\nABB 800xA Base 6.1.1-3 (part of System 800xA 6.1.1.2)\nABB 800xA Base 6.0.3-x (included in next revision)\n\nFor more information, please refer to ABB's Cybersecurity Advisory 7PAA013309.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
