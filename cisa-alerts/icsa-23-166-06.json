EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.2*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal* **Vulnerability:**  Protection Mechanism Failure2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers with access to the project file to recover previous \\- yet unprotected \\- versions of the project, without the knowledge of the know\\-how protection password.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products from Siemens are affected:* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V14: All versions* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V15: All versions* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V15\\.1: All versions* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V16: All versions* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V17: All versions* Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V18: All versions### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [PROTECTION MECHANISM FAILURE CWE\\-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)** The know\\-how protection feature in affected products does not properly update the encryption of existing program blocks when a project file is updated. This could allow attackers with access to the project file to recover previous \\- yet unprotected \\- versions of the project without the knowledge of the know\\-how protection password.[CVE\\-2023\\-30757](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30757)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.2 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Eli Biham, Sara Bitan, Alon Dankner, Arnon Lazerson, and Assaf Rosenbaum from the Faculty of Computer Science, Technion Haifa reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\.
