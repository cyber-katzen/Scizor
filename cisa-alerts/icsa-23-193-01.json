Once the module is updated to signed firmware (example 5.008 to 5.0029), it is not possible to revert to unsigned firmware versions.\nOrganizations should take the following actions to further secure ControlLogix communications modules from exploitation:\n\n\nUpdate firmware. Update EN2* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 11.004 and update EN4* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 5.002.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nProperly segment networks. Given a cyber actor would require network connectivity to the communication module to exploit the vulnerability, organizations should ensure ICS/SCADA networks are properly segmented within the process structure as well as from the Internet and other non-essential networks.\n\n\nImplement detection signatures. Use appended Snort signatures to monitor and detect anomalous Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets to Rockwell Automation devices.\n\n\nFor more information and to see Rockwell\u2019s detection rules, see Rockwell Automation\u2019s Security Advisory.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
