Once the module is updated to signed firmware (example 5\\.008 to 5\\.0029\\), it is not possible to revert to unsigned firmware versions.\n \n\n\n\n Organizations should take the following actions to further secure ControlLogix communications modules from exploitation:\n \n\n\n* **Update firmware.** \n Update EN2\\* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 11\\.004 and update EN4\\* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 5\\.002\\.\n\n\n* **Properly segment networks.** \n Given a cyber actor would require network connectivity to the communication module to exploit the vulnerability, organizations should ensure ICS/SCADA networks are properly segmented within the process structure as well as from the Internet and other non\\-essential networks.\n* **Implement detection signatures.** \n Use appended Snort signatures to monitor and detect anomalous Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets to Rockwell Automation devices.\n\n\n\n For more information and to see Rockwell\u2019s detection rules, see Rockwell Automation\u2019s\n [Security Advisory](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1140010) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n .
