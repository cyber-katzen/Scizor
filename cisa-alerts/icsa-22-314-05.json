For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor: Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment: RUGGEDCOM ROS\u00a0\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition where the affected web servers wait for the completion of each request, occupying all available HTTP connections. The web server recovers by itself once the attack ends.\u00a0\n3.

This could allow a remote attacker to create a denial-of-service condition that persists until the attack ends.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-39158 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated. the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nDeactivate the webserver if not required and if deactivation is supported by the product.\u00a0\nRestrict access to port 80/TCP and 443/TCP to only trusted IP addresses.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. \u00a0\nSiemens provides additional information on industrial security on the Siemens website.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens\u2019 products and solutions, users should contact Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-787941 in HTML and CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a low attack complexity.\u00a0\n",
