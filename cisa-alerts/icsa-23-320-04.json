EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : Mendix 7, Mendix 8, Mendix 9, Mendix 10* **Vulnerability**  : Authentication Bypass by Capture\\-Replay2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization or escalate privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Siemens Mendix Applications, are affected:* Mendix Applications using Mendix 7: all versions prior to V7\\.23\\.37* Mendix Applications using Mendix 8: all versions prior to V8\\.18\\.27* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9: all versions prior to V9\\.24\\.10* Mendix Applications using Mendix 10: all versions prior to V10\\.4\\.0### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE\\-REPLAY CWE\\-294](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)** A capture\\-replay flaw in the platform could have an impact to apps built with the platform, if certain preconditions are met that depend on the app's model and access control design. This could allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization, or escalate privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.[CVE\\-2023\\-45794](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-45794)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* Mendix Applications using Mendix 7: Update to [V7\\.23\\.37](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/7/)  or later version and redeploy your application* Mendix Applications using Mendix 8: Update to [V8\\.18\\.27](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/8/)  or later version and redeploy your application* Mendix Applications using Mendix 9: Update to [V9\\.24\\.10](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/9/)  or later version and redeploy your application* Mendix Applications using Mendix 10: Update to [V10\\.4\\.0](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/10/)  or later version and redeploy your application As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-084182 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-084182.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-084182.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.5\\.
