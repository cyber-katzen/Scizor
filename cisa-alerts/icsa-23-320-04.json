EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mendix 7, Mendix 8, Mendix 9, Mendix 10\nVulnerability: Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization or escalate privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens Mendix Applications, are affected:\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 7: all versions prior to V7.23.37\nMendix Applications using Mendix 8: all versions prior to V8.18.27\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: all versions prior to V9.24.10\nMendix Applications using Mendix 10: all versions prior to V10.4.0\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\nA capture-replay flaw in the platform could have an impact to apps built with the platform, if certain preconditions are met that depend on the app's model and access control design. This could allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization, or escalate privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.\nCVE-2023-45794\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nMendix Applications using Mendix 7: Update to\u00a0V7.23.37\u00a0or later version and redeploy your application\nMendix Applications using Mendix 8: Update to\u00a0V8.18.27\u00a0or later version and redeploy your application\nMendix Applications using Mendix 9: Update to\u00a0V9.24.10\u00a0or later version and redeploy your application\nMendix Applications using Mendix 10: Update to\u00a0V10.4.0\u00a0or later version and redeploy your application\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-084182 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nNovember 16, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
