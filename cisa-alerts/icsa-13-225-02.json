[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryOSIsoft Multiple Vulnerabilities================================ Last Revised May 06, 2015 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-225\\-02OVERVIEW-------- OSIsoft has identified multiple vulnerabilities in the PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 and reported them to ICS\\-CERT. OSIsoft has produced a software update that mitigates these vulnerabilities. OSIsoft has tested the software update to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to shut down the PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 instance and cause a data gap for PI points belonging to it. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following OSIsoft PI Interfaces are affected:* All versions of the PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 prior to Version 1\\.0\\.6\\.158\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could shut down the PI Interface for the IEEE C37\\.118 instance and cause a data gap for PI points belonging to it. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- OSIsoft is a US\\-based company that maintains its headquarters in San Leandro, California, with operations globally. The affected product, PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118, collects information from synchro\\-phasor measurement units (PMU devices). According to OSIsoft, PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 is deployed across electric utilities and associated research entities. OSIsoft estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE\\-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013\\. The PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 could read from an invalid memory address when processing C37\\.118 configuration packets. This could allow the attacker to shut down the PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 instance and cause a data gap for PI points belonging to it. CVE\\-2013\\-2801NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-2801, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013\\.### IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER a The PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 could corrupt or exhaust memory when processing C37\\.118 configuration packets. This could allow the attacker to shut down the PI Interface for IEEE C37\\.118 instance and cause a data gap for PI points belonging to it. CVE\\-2013\\-2800NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-2800, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C. c ### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.MITIGATION---------- OSIsoft has produced a software update that resolves these vulnerabilities. OSIsoft encourages customers using the affected product to upgrade to Version 1\\.0\\.6\\.158 or later. The software update can be found at the OSIsoft technical support Web site:<http://techsupport.osisoft.com/> ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013\\. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/tips/ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B, Web site last accessed August 13, 2013\\. that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT Web page ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
