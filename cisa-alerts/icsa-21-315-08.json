RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to an access violation and arbitrary code execution on the target system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affects the following NX products:\u00a0\n\nNX 1953 Series: All versions prior to v1973.3700\nNX 1980 Series: All versions prior to v1988\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nThe affected application contains a use-after-free vulnerability while parsing OBJ files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-41535 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nThe affected application is vulnerable to information disclosure by unexpected access to an uninitialized pointer while parsing user-supplied OBJ files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information from memory locations.\nCVE-2021-41538 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nxina1i working, with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens and CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the NX and recommends updating to the latest version.\u00a0\n\nNX 1953 Series: Update to v1973.3700 or later version\nNX 1980 Series: Update to v1988 or later version\n\nSiemens recommends users avoid opening of untrusted files from unknown sources.\u00a0\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-328042\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
