EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.1*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available* **Vendor:**  B\\&R Industrial Automation* **Equipment:**  Systems Diagnostics Manager (SDM)* **Vulnerability:**  Cross\\-site Scripting2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code to exfiltrate data and perform any action within the user's browser session.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions B\\&R System Diagnostics Manager, used to diagnose B\\&R controllers, are affected:* System Diagnostics Manager: runtime versions 3\\.00 and later* System Diagnostics Manager: runtime versions C4\\.93 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) A reflected cross\\-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in System Diagnostics Manager of B\\&R Automation Runtime versions \\>\\=3\\.00 and \\<\\=C4\\.93 that enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user\u2019s browser session.[CVE\\-2022\\-4286](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4286)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Austria### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER CISA discovered a public proof of concept (PoC) as authored by S. Robertz and G. Hechenberger of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab and reported to B\\&R Industrial Automation.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- B\\&R recommends users to update to the latest version of the product at earliest convenience (instructions to install updates is described in the user manual):* Update all SDM products to firmware [D4\\.93](https://www.br-automation.com/en/downloads/#categories=Software-1344987434933/Automation+Runtime-1344987435077=undefined/Automation+Studio+4.12-1654436096778=undefined/fullText=D0493)  or later. B\\&R also recommends the following workarounds to mitigate the risk of exploitation:* Deactivate the SDM when not needed.* Refer to \u201cgeneral security recommendations\u201d in the [B\\&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory](https://www.br-automation.com/downloads_br_productcatalogue/assets/1675607299099-en-original-1.0.pdf)* Do not use hyperlinks provided by untrusted third parties to access the SDM.* Use external Web Application Firewalls when possible.* Visit the [B\\&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory](https://www.br-automation.com/downloads_br_productcatalogue/assets/1675607299099-en-original-1.0.pdf)  for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
