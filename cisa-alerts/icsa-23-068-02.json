EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 6.1\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor:\u00a0B&R Industrial Automation\nEquipment:\u00a0Systems Diagnostics Manager (SDM)\nVulnerability:\u00a0Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code to exfiltrate data and perform any action within the user's browser session.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions B&R System Diagnostics Manager, used to diagnose B&R controllers, are affected:\n\nSystem Diagnostics Manager: runtime versions 3.00 and later\nSystem Diagnostics Manager: runtime versions C4.93 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in System Diagnostics Manager of B&R Automation Runtime versions >=3.00 and <=C4.93 that enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user\u2019s browser session.\nCVE-2022-4286\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Austria\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof of concept (PoC) as authored by S. Robertz and G. Hechenberger of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab and reported to B&R Industrial Automation.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nB&R recommends users to update to the latest version of the product at earliest convenience (instructions to install updates is described in the user manual):\n\nUpdate all SDM products to firmware\u00a0D4.93\u00a0or later.\n\nB&R also recommends the following workarounds to mitigate the risk of exploitation:\n\nDeactivate the SDM when not needed.\nRefer to \u201cgeneral security recommendations\u201d in the\u00a0B&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory\u00a0\nDo not use hyperlinks provided by untrusted third parties to access the SDM.\nUse external Web Application Firewalls when possible.\nVisit the\u00a0B&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory\u00a0for more information.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\u00a0\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\u00a0\nUse secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs),when remote access is required. VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Note: VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\u00a0\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
