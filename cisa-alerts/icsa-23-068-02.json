MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n B\\&R recommends users to update to the latest version of the product at earliest convenience (instructions to install updates is described in the user manual):\n \n\n\n* Update all SDM products to firmware\n [D4\\.93](https://www.br-automation.com/en/downloads/#categories=Software-1344987434933/Automation+Runtime-1344987435077=undefined/Automation+Studio+4.12-1654436096778=undefined/fullText=D0493) \n or later.\n\n\n\n B\\&R also recommends the following workarounds to mitigate the risk of exploitation:\n \n\n\n* Deactivate the SDM when not needed.\n* Refer to \u201cgeneral security recommendations\u201d in the\n [B\\&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory](https://www.br-automation.com/downloads_br_productcatalogue/assets/1675607299099-en-original-1.0.pdf)\n* Do not use hyperlinks provided by untrusted third parties to access the SDM.\n* Use external Web Application Firewalls when possible.\n* Visit the\n [B\\&R Industrial Automation\u2019s advisory](https://www.br-automation.com/downloads_br_productcatalogue/assets/1675607299099-en-original-1.0.pdf) \n for more information.\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* Use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs),when remote access is required. VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Note: VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n .
