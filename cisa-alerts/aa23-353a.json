Routinely take inventory of assets and data to identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\n2. Prioritize remediation of known exploited vulnerabilities.\n3. Enable and enforce multifactor authentication with strong passwords.\n4. Close unused ports and remove applications not deemed necessary for day\\-to\\-day operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n***Note:** \n This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing \\#StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These \\#StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit* \n[*stopransomware.gov*](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\")\n*to see all \\#StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no\\-cost resources.* \n\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\u00a0and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known IOCs and TTPs associated with the ALPHV Blackcat ransomware as a service (RaaS) identified through FBI investigations as recently as February 2024\\.\n \n\n\n\n This advisory provides updates to the FBI FLASH\n [BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware Indicators of Compromise](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf \"BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware Indicators of Compromise\") \n released April 19, 2022, and to this advisory released December 19, 2023\\. ALPHV Blackcat actors have since employed improvised communication methods by creating victim\\-specific emails to notify of the initial compromise. Since mid\\-December 2023, of the nearly 70 leaked victims, the healthcare sector has been the most commonly victimized. This is likely in response to the ALPHV Blackcat administrator\u2019s post encouraging its affiliates to target hospitals after operational action against the group and its infrastructure in early December 2023\\.\n \n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and HHS encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ALPHV Blackcat ransomware and data extortion incidents.\n \n\n\n\n In February 2023, ALPHV Blackcat administrators announced the ALPHV Blackcat Ransomware 2\\.0 Sphynx update, which was rewritten to provide additional features to affiliates, such as better defense evasion and additional tooling. This ALPHV Blackcat update has the capability to encrypt both Windows and Linux devices, and VMWare instances. ALPHV Blackcat affiliates have extensive networks and experience with ransomware and data extortion operations.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-353A \\#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat (Update)](/sites/default/files/2024-03/aa23-353a-stopransomware-alphv-blackcat-update_2.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 578\\.24 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-353A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2024-02/AA23-353A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 46\\.14 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA23\\-353A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2024-02/AA23-353A-StopRansomware-ALPHV-Blackcat.stix_.json) \n\n (JSON, 32\\.93 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae \n for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 14\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\") \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n ALPHV Blackcat affiliates use advanced social engineering techniques and open source research on a company to gain initial access. Actors pose as company IT and/or helpdesk staff and use phone calls or SMS messages \\[\n [T1598](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1598/ \"Phishing for Information\") \n ] to obtain credentials from employees to access the target network \\[\n [T1586](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1586/ \"Compromise Accounts\") \n ]. ALPHV Blackcat affiliates use uniform resource locators (URLs) to live\\-chat with victims to convey demands and initiate processes to restore the victims\u2019 encrypted files.\n \n\n\n\n After gaining access to a victim network, ALPHV Blackcat affiliates deploy remote access software such as AnyDesk, Mega sync, and Splashtop in preparation of data exfiltration. ALPHV Blackcat affiliates create a user account, \u201caadmin,\u201d and use Kerberos token generation for domain access \\[\n [T1558](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1558/ \"Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets\") \n ]. After gaining access to networks, they use legitimate remote access and tunneling tools, such as Plink and Ngrok \\[\n [S0508](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0508/ \"ngrok\") \n ]. ALPHV Blackcat affiliates claim to use Brute Ratel C4 \\[\n [S1063](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S1063/ \"Brute Ratel C4\") \n ] and Cobalt Strike \\[\n [S1054](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\") \n ]\u00a0as beacons to command and control servers. ALPHV Blackcat affiliates use the open source adversary\\-in\\-the\\-middle attack \\[\n [T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1557/ \"Adversary-in-the-Middle\") \n ] framework Evilginx2, which allows them to obtain multifactor authentication (MFA) credentials, login credentials, and session cookies. The actors also obtain passwords from the domain controller, local network, and deleted backup servers to move laterally throughout the network \\[\n [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1555/ \"Credentials from Password Stores\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n To evade detection, affiliates employ allowlisted applications such as Metasploit. Once installed on the domain controller, the logs are cleared on the exchange server. Then Mega.nz or Dropbox are used to move, exfiltrate, and/or download victim data. The ransomware is then deployed, and the ransom note is embedded as a file.txt. According to public reporting, affiliates have additionally used POORTRY and STONESTOP to terminate security processes.\n \n\n\n\n Some ALPHV Blackcat affiliates exfiltrate data after gaining access and extort victims without deploying ransomware. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, ALPHV Blackcat affiliates communicate with victims via TOR \\[\n [S0183](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0183/ \"Tor\") \n ], Tox, email, or encrypted applications. The threat actors then delete victim data from the victim\u2019s system.\n \n\n\n\n ALPHV Blackcat affiliates offer to provide unsolicited cyber remediation advice as an incentive for payment, offering to provide victims with \u201cvulnerability reports\u201d and \u201csecurity recommendations\u201d detailing how they penetrated the system and how to prevent future re\\-victimization upon receipt of ransom payment.\u00a0The ALPHV Blackcat encryptor results in a file with the following naming convention: RECOVER\\-(seven\\-digit extension) FILES.txt.\n \n\n\n\n\n![Figure 1: Ransom Note Instruction](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2024-02/Figure%201%20-%20Ransom%20Note%20Instruction.png?itok=nHWunuch)\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 1: Ransom Note Instruction* \n\n\n\n\n### **INDICATORS OF

Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.\n2. Reimage compromised hosts.\n3. Provision new account credentials.\n4. Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.\n5. Report the compromise or phishing incident to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center (\n [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\") \n or 888\\-282\\-0870\\). State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to MS\\-ISAC (\n [SOC@cisecurity.org](mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org \"Report to the Center for Internet Security\") \n or 866\\-787\\-4722\\).\n6. To report spoofing or phishing attempts (or to report that you\u2019ve been a victim), file a complaint with the FBI\u2019s\n [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complaint Center\") \n\n )\n \n , or contact your local\n [FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\") \n to report an incident.\n\n\n### **MITIGATIONS**\n\n\n\n These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure by design principles and tactics into their software development practices limiting the impact of ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the security posture for their customers.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage and\n [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture based on threat actor activity and to reduce the risk of compromise by ALPHV Blackcat threat actors. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\u00a0Due to the threat ALPHV Blackcat\u2019s poses in the healthcare sector, healthcare organizations can look to the\n [Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/performance-goals.html \"HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n to implement cybersecurity protections against the most common threats. tactics, techniques, and procedures used against this sector.\n \n\n\n* Secure remote access tools by:\n\t+ **Implementing application controls** \n\t to manage and control execution of software, including allowlisting remote access programs. Application controls should prevent installation and execution of portable versions of unauthorized remote access and other software. A properly configured application allowlisting solution will block any unlisted application execution. Allowlisting is important because antivirus solutions may fail to detect the execution of malicious portable executables when the files use any combination of compression, encryption, or obfuscation.\n\t+ Applying recommendations in CISA's joint\n\t [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](/sites/default/files/2023-06/Guide%20to%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20Software_clean%20Final_508c.pdf \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\") \n\t .\n* **Implementing FIDO/WebAuthn authentication or Public key Infrastructure (PKI)\\-based MFA** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.H](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"CPG Report March 2023 Update\") \n ]\\[\n [HPH CPG \u2013 Multifactor Authentication](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/performance-goals.html \"HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals - Multifactor Authentication\") \n ]. These MFA implementations are resistant to phishing and not susceptible to push bombing or SIM swap attacks, which are techniques known be used by ALPHV Blackcat affiliates. See CISA\u2019s Fact Sheet\n [Implementing Phishing\\-Resistant MFA](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf \"Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA\") \n for more information.\n* **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.** \n To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic \\[\n [CPG 5\\.1](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"CPG Report March 2023 Update\") \n ]\\[\n [HPH CPG \u2013 Detect and Respond to Relevant Threats and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/performance-goals.html \"HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals - Detect and Respond to Relevant Threats and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\")\n ], including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\n* **Implement user training on social engineering and phishing attacks** \n \\[\n [CPG 2\\.I](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report \"CPG Report March 2023 Update\") \n ]\\[\n [HPH CPG \u2013 Basic Cybersecurity Training](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov/performance-goals.html \"HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals - Basic Cybersecurity Training\") \n ]. Regularly educate users on identifying suspicious emails and links, not interacting with those suspicious items, and the importance of reporting instances of opening suspicious emails, links, attachments, or other potential lures.\n* **Implement internal mail and messaging monitoring** \n . Monitoring internal mail and messaging traffic to identify suspicious activity is essential as users may be phished from outside the targeted network or without the knowledge of the organizational security team. Establish a baseline of normal network traffic and scrutinize any deviations.\n* **Implement free security tools** \n to prevent cyber threat actors from redirecting users to malicious websites to steal their credentials. For more information see, CISA\u2019s\n [Free Cybersecurity Services and Tools](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/free-cybersecurity-services-and-tools \"Free Cybersecurity Services and Tools\") \n webpage.\n* **Install and maintain antivirus software.** \n Antivirus software recognizes malware and protects your computer against it. Installing antivirus software from a reputable vendor is an important step in preventing and detecting infections. Always visit vendor sites directly rather than clicking on advertisements or email links. Because attackers are continually creating new viruses and other forms of malicious code, it is important to keep your antivirus software up to date.\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization\u2019s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 1\\-3\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n CISA and FBI recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [Stopransomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware \"#StopRansomware\") \n is a whole\\-of\\-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\n* Resource to reduce the risk of a ransomware attack:\n [\\#StopRansomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide \"#StopRansomware Guide\") \n .\n* No\\-cost cyber hygiene services:\n [Cyber Hygiene Services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services \"Cyber Hygiene Services\") \n and\n [Ransomware Readiness Assessment](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0 \"Ransomware Readiness Assessment CSET v10.3\") \n .\n* Health and Human Services\n [HPH Cybersecurity Gateway](https://hphcyber.hhs.gov \"HPH Cybersecurity Gateway\") \n hosts the HPH CPGs and links to HHS cybersecurity resources.\n\n\n### **DISCLAIMER**\n\n\n\n The information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
