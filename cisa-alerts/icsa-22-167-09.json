TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of SCALANCE LPE9403 (Local Processing Engine), a processing power extension for the SCALANCE family of products, are affected:* All versions prior to v2\\.0* The vulnerabilities exist within the third\\-party components CivetWeb, Docker, Linux kernel and system, which are part of the SCALANCE LPE9403\\.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded filepaths when running on an OS other than Windows when using the built\\-in HTTP form\\-based file upload mechanism, via the mg\\_handle\\_form\\_request API. Web applications using the file upload form handler, as well as those that use parts of the user\\-controlled filename in the output path, are susceptible to directory traversal.[CVE\\-2020\\-27304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER INITIALIZATION CWE\\-665](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/665.html) A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the timerqueue\\_add function in lib/timerqueue.c.

The incoming requests\u2019 bodies are not closed after the handler panic, which could lead to a Reverse Proxy crash.[CVE\\-2021\\-36221](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-36221)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.5 [ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE\\-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) The fix for [CVE\\-2021\\-33196](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-33196)  can be bypassed by crafted inputs.
