Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in information disclosure. The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.\nGE has produced two security advisories (GEIP12-14 and GEIP12-15) available on the GE Intelligent Platforms support Web site to inform customers about these vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nGE Intelligent Platforms reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions:\n\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal: All versions.\n\nImpact\nCVE-2013-0651 is a security misconfiguration that, if exploited, could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve sensitive configuration information such as system usernames and passwords for Portal data sources. The security misconfiguration is a default installation setting that can be subsequently changed.\nCVE-2013-0652 is an information disclosure vulnerability that, if exploited, could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain a list of usernames for users of the Portal application and a limited amount of other technical information that could aid the attacker in conducting additional attacks.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nAccording to GE, Proficy Real-Time Information Portal is a Web-based data visualization and reporting tool that is deployed across multiple industries worldwide.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nInformation Disclosure VulnerabilityCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html, Web site last accessed January 22, 2013.\nBy default, the Portal installation creates files and folders in unauthenticated locations on the IIS or Apache Web server. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration by making an HTTP GET request on Port 80/TCP to retrieve configuration files and other sensitive information.\nCVE-2013-0651 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).\nInformation Disclosure VulnerabilityCWE-200: Information Exposure, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html, Web site last accessed January 22, 2013.\nProficy Real-Time Information Portal exposes methods of a vulnerable class via Java RMI. Even with Portal authentication enabled within the application, Portal unnecessarily exposes some of these methods and allows them to be called without authentication. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by making an RMI call over Port 80/TCP to retrieve information.\nCVE-2013-0652 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nTo mitigate these information disclosure vulnerabilities, GE recommends making the following configuration changes:\n\nDisable \u201cAnonymous Authentication\u201d and \u201cWindows Authentication.\u201d\nRequire authentication for all Portal users.\nConfigure an SSL certificate to encrypt Portal application traffic.\n\nPlease see GE Intelligent Platforms Product Security Advisory GEIP12-14 and GEIP12-15 for detailed instructions.\nGEIP12-14\nGEIP12-15\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
