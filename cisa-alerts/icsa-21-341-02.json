MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends users to upgrade to the most current version of their products:* XMC20: Upgrade to Version R15A* FOX61x: Upgrade to Version R15A Please refer to the Hitachi Energy [XMC20 advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?utm_campaign=2021.11_5284_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_content=2021.11_5284_Cybersecurity%20Advisory&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&DocumentID=8DBD000069&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch&elqTrackId=167bcd9389a64fd18712fed9e03369c5&elq=87e5aaeebcf8446ba531f043a55760c0&elqaid=3849&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=3265)  for more details on affected module information. Please refer to the Hitachi Energy [FOX61x advisory](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000062&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  for more details on affected module information. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Do not directly connect to the Internet.* Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. For additional information and access to updated firmware, please contact the [Hitachi Energy service organization](https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
