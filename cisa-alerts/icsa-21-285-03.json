EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System)\nVulnerabilities: Classic Buffer Overflow, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Path Traversal, Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain code execution, read/delete files, and create arbitrary files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of IGSS software are affected:\n\nIGSS Data Collector (dc.exe): v15.0.0.21243 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe affected product is vulnerable to remote code execution, due to missing length check on user supplied data, when a constructed message is received on the network.\nCVE-2021-22802 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nBy sending constructed messages on the network, an attacker could write arbitrary files to folders in context of the DC module that could lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-22803 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nAn issue exists that could allow disclosure and read access of arbitrary files in the context of the user running IGSS, due to missing validation of user supplied data in network messages.\nCVE-2021-22804 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nAn issue exists that could allow disclosure and read access of arbitrary files in the context of the user running IGSS, due to missing validation of user supplied data in network messages.\nCVE-2021-22805 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nVyacheslav Moskvin, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric recommends users update to Version 15.0.0.21244 of the IGSS DC module. Please note, dc.exe includes fixes for these vulnerabilities and is available for download through IGSS Master > Update IGSS Software or at the IGSS update link.\nUsers should employ appropriate patching methodologies. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the use of backups as well as an evaluation of the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric\u2019s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.\nIf users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:\n\nOnly accept incoming connections from machines, which names have been added as a station in the IGSS System Configuration module by setting the registry key called \u201cMatchWinName\u201d to 1 under: \u201cHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\SchneiderElectric\\IGSS32\\V15.00.00\\DC_HKLM\\\u201d\nFollow the general security recommendation below and verify devices are isolated on a private network and firewalls are configured with strict boundaries for devices that require remote access.\n\nFor more information see Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification: SEVD-2021-285-03\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
