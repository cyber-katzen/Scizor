EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Teamcenter\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-132-16 Siemens Teamcenter (Update A) that was published June 16, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead the binary to crash or allow an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Teamcenter product lifecycle management software:\n\nTeamcenter v12.4: All versions prior to v12.4.0.13\nTeamcenter v13.0: All versions prior to v13.0.0.9\nTeamcenter v13.1: All versions\nTeamcenter v13.2: All versions prior to v13.2.0.8\nTeamcenter v13.3: All versions prior to v13.3.0.3\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nTeamcenter v14.0: All versions prior to v14.0.0.2\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 -----------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe tcserver.exe binary in affected applications is vulnerable to a stack overflow condition during the parsing of user input that may lead the binary to crash.\nCVE-2022-24290 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611\nThe application contains an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem.\nCVE-2022-29801 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nHan Lee from Apple Information Security reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet, available:\n\nTeamcenter v12.4: Update to v12.4.0.13 or later\nTeamcenter v13.0: Update to v13.0.0.9 or later\u00a0\nTeamcenter v13.1: Update to v13.1.0.9 or later\nTeamcenter v13.2: Update to v13.2.0.8 or later\nTeamcenter v13.3: Update to v13.3.0.3 or later\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nTeamcenter V14.0: Update to V14.0.0.2 or later\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\nTo reduce the risk, Siemens recommends users harden the application\u2019s host to prevent local access by untrusted personnel.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-789162\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities\n",
