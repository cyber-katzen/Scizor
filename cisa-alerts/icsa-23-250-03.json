EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Socomec\nEquipment: MOD3GP-SY-120K\nVulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information, Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking, Code Injection, Plaintext Storage of a Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious Javascript code, obtain sensitive information, or steal session cookies.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Socomec products are affected:\n\nMODULYS GP (MOD3GP-SY-120K): Web firmware v01.12.10\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nPersistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in the web application of MOD3GP-SY-120K allows an authenticated remote attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting an XSS payload into the field MAIL_RCV. When a legitimate user attempts to access to the vulnerable page of the web application, the XSS payload will be executed.\nCVE-2023-38582\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThanks to the weaknesses that the web application has at the user management level, an attacker could obtain the information from the headers that is necessary to create specially designed URLs and originate malicious actions when a legitimate user is logged into the web application.\nCVE-2023-39446\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0INSECURE STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-922\nSending some requests in the web application of the vulnerable device allows information to be obtained due to the lack of security in the authentication process.\nCVE-2023-41965\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0RELIANCE ON COOKIES WITHOUT VALIDATION AND INTEGRITY CHECKING CWE-565\nSession management within the web application is incorrect and allows attackers to steal session cookies to perform a multitude of actions that the web app allows on the device.\nCVE-2023-41084\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nThe absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows potential attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the web section (MAIL SERVER) where the information is displayed. Injection can be done on parameter MAIL_RCV. When a legitimate user attempts to review NOTIFICATION/MAIL SERVER, the injected code will be executed.\nCVE-2023-40221\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE-256\nThe web application that owns the device clearly stores the credentials within the user management section. Obtaining this information can be done remotely due to the incorrect management of the sessions in the web application.\nCVE-2023-39452\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nA potential attacker with or without (cookie theft) access to the device would be able to include malicious code (XSS) when uploading new device configuration that could affect the intended function of the device.\nCVE-2023-38255\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAar\u00f3n Flecha Men\u00e9ndez reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSocomec reports that MODULYS GP (MOD3GP-SY-120K) is an End-of-Life product. Socomec recommends using MODULYS GP2 (M4-S-XXX) instead. MODULYS GP2 (M4-S-XXX) is not affected by the above vulnerabilities.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
