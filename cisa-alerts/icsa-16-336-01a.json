Ilya Karpov and Dmitry Sklyarov of Positive Technologies and Sergey Temnikov and Vladimir Dashchenko of Kaspersky Lab coordinated these vulnerabilities directly with Siemens. Siemens has produced an update to mitigate some of these vulnerabilities.\nSome of these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- \nThe following SICAM PAS versions are affected:\n\nSICAM PAS: All versions prior to 8.09.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or remotely exploit arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected product, SICAM PAS, is energy automation software for operating electrical substations. According to Siemens, SICAM PAS is deployed across the Energy sector. Siemens estimates that this product is used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUSE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALSCWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html, web site last accessed December 01, 2016.\n\nA factory account with hard-coded passwords is present in the SICAM PAS installations.

Siemens recommends that users upgrade to the latest version. In order to receive the SICAM PAS V8.09 update, please contact the Siemens Energy Customer Support Center at support.energy@siemens.com.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\nSiemens strongly recommends users protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). Siemens also advises that users configure the operational environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-946325 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
