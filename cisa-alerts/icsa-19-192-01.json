EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: CNCSoft ScreenEditor\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-Bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause buffer overflow conditions that may allow information disclosure, remote code execution, or crash the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAccording to Delta Electronics, the following versions are affected:\n\nCNCSoft ScreenEditor Versions 1.00.89 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities may be exploited by processing specially crafted project files, allowing an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. There is a lack of user input validation before copying data from project files onto the heap.\nCVE-2019-10982 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nMultiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities may cause information disclosure due to lacking user input validation for processing project files.\nCVE-2019-10992 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNatnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends the following:\n\nUpdate to the latest version of ScreenEditor, Version 1.00.94.\nDelta Electronics also recommends users restrict the interaction of the application to trusted files.\n\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n\u00a0\n",
