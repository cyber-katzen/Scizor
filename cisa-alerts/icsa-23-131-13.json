EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0PTC\nEquipment:\u00a0Vuforia Studio\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Insufficiently Protected Credentials, Improper Authorization, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Path Traversal, Cross-site Request Forgery\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to view credentials, perform a cross-site request forgery attack, resend requests, or upload or delete arbitrary files.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nPTC reports these vulnerabilities affect the following Vuforia Studio products:\n\nVuforia Studio: all versions prior to 9.9\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nThe local Vuforia web application does not support HTTPS, and federated credentials are passed via basic authentication.\nCVE-2023-29168 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nAn attacker with local access to the machine could record the traffic, which could allow them to resend requests without the server authenticating that the user or session are valid.\nCVE-2023-24476 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 1.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nBy changing the filename parameter in the request, an attacker could delete any file with the permissions of the Vuforia server account.\nCVE-2023-29152 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nA user could use the \u201cUpload Resource\u201d functionality to upload files to any location on the disk.\nCVE-2023-27881 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nBefore importing a project into Vuforia, a user could modify the \u201cresourceDirectory\u201d attribute in the appConfig.json file to be a different path.\nCVE-2023-29502 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\nPTC Vuforia Studio does not require a token; this could allow an attacker with local access to perform a cross-site request forgery attack or a replay attack.\nCVE-2023-31200 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nLockheed Martin\u2014Red Team reported these vulnerabilities to PTC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPTC recommends users upgrade to Vuforia Studio release 9.9 or higher.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.\n",
