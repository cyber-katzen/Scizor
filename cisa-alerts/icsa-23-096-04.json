EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Korenix\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Jetwave\u00a0\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Command Injection, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain full access to the underlying operating system of the device or cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Korenix Jetwave, are affected:\u00a0\n\nKorenix JetWave4221 HP-E versions V1.3.0 and prior\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 3220/3420 V3 versions prior to V1.7\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2212G version V1.3.T\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2212X/2112S version V1.3.0\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2211C versions prior to V1.6\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2411/2111 versions prior to V1.5\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2411L/2111L versions prior to V1.6\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2414/2114 versions prior to V1.4\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2424 versions prior to V1.3\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 2460 versions prior to V1.6\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 4200 Series 1.3.0 and JetWave 3000 Series 1.6.0 are vulnerable to command injection. An attacker could modify the file_name parameter to execute commands as root.\nCVE-2023-23294\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\u00a0\nKorenix Jetwave 4200 Series 1.3.0 and JetWave 3000 Series 1.6.0 are vulnerable to command injection via /goform/formSysCmd. An attacker could modify the sysCmd parameter to execute commands as root.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23295\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave 4200 Series 1.3.0 and JetWave 3200 Series 1.6.0 are vulnerable to a possible denial-of-service condition via /goform/formDefault. When logged in, a user could issue a POST request so that the underlying binary exits. The web-service then becomes unavailable and cannot be accessed until a user reboots the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-23296\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications \u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThomas Weber of CyberDanube reported these vulnerabilities to Korenix.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nKorenix recommends all users update their JetWave products to the latest firmware:\u00a0\n\nKorenix JetWave\u00a04221 HP-E V1.4.0\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02212G V1.10\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02212X V1.11/2112S V1.11\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02211C V1.6\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02411/2111 V1.5\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02411L/2111L V1.6\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02414/2114 V1.4\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02424 V1.3\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a02460 V1.6\u00a0\nKorenix JetWave\u00a03220 V3 V1.7/3420 V3 V1.7\u00a0\n\nAccording to Korenix, users should visit\u00a0Korenix\u00a0and navigate to the appropriate Korenix JetWave product page, found in\u00a0the \u201cWireless\u201d section\u00a0on the site, and download the latest firmware.\u00a0\nFor more information, see Korenix\u2019s\u00a0Security Advisory.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0\n\n",
