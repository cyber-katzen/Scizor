RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized client to connect to the S+ Operations servers (human machine interface (HMI) network), to act as a legitimate S+ Operations client.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nABB reports this vulnerability affects the following Ability Symphony Plus products:\u00a0\n\nS+ Operations 3.3 SP2 (part of SPR1 2023.0)\nS+ Operations 3.3 SP1 and earlier 3.x versions\nS+ Operations 2.2\nS+ Operations 2.1 SP2 and earlier 2.x versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nAn unauthorized client able to connect to the ABB S+ Operations servers (HMI network) can act as a legitimate S+ Operations client, reading any data and changing its configuration, which could result in corruption of data, unauthorized disclosure of information, unexpected operation of equipment or causing the product or system to stop (denial-of-service condition).\nCVE-2023-0228\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nABB reported this vulnerability on their website publicly.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nABB advises all users to review their installations to determine if they are using an impacted product as listed above. \u00a0End users should immediately apply the mitigations listed below to restrict or prevent an attacker\u2019s ability to compromise these systems.\n\nS+ Operations 3.3 SP2 (part of SPR2 2023.0): deploy the upcoming update for this version; planned release within Quarter (Q) 3 2023.\nS+ Operations 3.3 SP1 and earlier 3.x versions: deploy the upcoming update for this version; planned release within Q4 2023.\nS+ Operations 2.2: deploy the upcoming update for this version; planned release within Q4 2023.\nS+ Operations 2.1 SP2 and earlier 2.x versions: upgrade the system to version S+ Operations 3.3 with the updates described above to mitigate the issue completely.\n\nIn addition to the updates above, ABB recommends users follow the mitigating factors as described below:\n\nFollow the ABB's recommended approach of designing and deploying a secure network for industrial use,\u00a0ICS Cyber Security Reference Architecture Guide, 8VZZ000368D0066\u2014S+ Operations is not intended to be directly connected to the internet.\u00a0\nEnable host authentication and data integrity via IPsec\u2014documented in\u00a0\u201cSymphony Plus Secure deployment guide for Windows 10 and Server 2016/2019 user manual\u201d, 8VZZ001006T0001\u2014to prevent an attack by an unauthorized client able to connect to the S+ Operations servers (HMI network).\nApply security countermeasures at host-level to mitigate the likelihood of an attack to the S+ Operations client machine, like hardening practices and use of malware prevention solutions\u2014see section \u201cWhat is the scope of the vulnerability?\u00a0\n\nFor more information,\u00a0see ABB's cybersecurity advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable from an adjacent network. This vulnerability has low attack complexity.\n",
