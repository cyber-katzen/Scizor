MITIGATIONS--------------- Honeywell recommends users with potentially affected products take the following steps to protect themselves:* Update WIN\\-PAK to latest version, WIN\\-PAK 4\\.7\\.2 B1072\\.3\\.4, before applying the patch, which is available on the [Honeywell Mywebtech portal](https://mywebtech.honeywell.com/Systems/Home)  .* As a best practice, Honeywell recommends users isolate systems from the Internet or create additional layers of defense to their system from the Internet by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ.* If remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located. CISA recommends users take the following\u00a0defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.
