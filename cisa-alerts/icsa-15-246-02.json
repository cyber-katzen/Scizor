Reflected Cross\\-Site Scripting (nonpersistent) allows an attacker to craft a specific URL, which contains Java script that will be executed on the client browser. CVE\\-2015\\-6462NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-6462, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 3\\.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N, web site last accessed September 3, 2015\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user clicks on the specifically crafted web link.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.#### DIFFICULTY Crafting a working exploit for these vulnerabilities would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince a person with HTTP access to the PLC web server to click on the specifically crafted web link. In addition, the attacker must know the IP address of the target PLC in order to craft the link. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.MITIGATION---------- Schneider Electric released a firmware patch for the listed products to address these vulnerabilities. It will initially only be available through Schneider Electric\u2019s Customer Support teams and will be included in the next scheduled product firmware update. In addition, specific modules and firmware versions allow the HTTP/FTP server to be disabled through configuration settings, please consult your product documentation for further information.
