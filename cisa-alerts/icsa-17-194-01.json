The new version can be obtained from Siemens customer support or from authorized partners.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-339433 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\n\nAn attacker with network access to the SiPass integrated server could bypass the authentication mechanism and perform administrative operations.\nCVE-2017-9939 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\n\nAn attacker with access to a low-privileged user account can read or write files on the file system of the SiPass integrated server over the network.\nCVE-2017-9940 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n\nCHANNEL ACCESSIBLE BY NON-ENDPOINT ('MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE') CWE-300\n\nAn attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle position between the SiPass integrated server and SiPass integrated clients could read or modify the network communication.\nCVE-2017-9941 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n\nSTORING PASSWORDS IN A RECOVERABLE FORMAT CWE-257\n\nAn attacker with local access to the SiPass integrated server or SiPass integrated client could potentially obtain credentials from the systems.\nCVE-2017-9942 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Germany\n",
