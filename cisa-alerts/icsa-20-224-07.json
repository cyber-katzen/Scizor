RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to locally escalate privileges and modify files that should be protected against writing.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Automation License Manager (ALM), a software management platform, are affected:\n\nAutomation License Manager 5: All versions\nAutomation License Manager 6: All versions prior to v6.0.8\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nThe application does not properly validate the users\u2019 privileges when executing some operations, which could allow an attacker with low permissions to arbitrarily modify files that should be protected against writing.\nCVE-2020-7583 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nLasse Trolle Borup of Danish Cyber Defense reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends the following:\n\nUsers of License Manager 5: Disable access to drives which have licenses installed, for non-administrator users.\nUsers of License Manager 6: Update to v6.0.8 or later version.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory SSA-388646\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nPractice\u00a0principle of least privilege.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
