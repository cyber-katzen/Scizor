MITIGATIONS--------------- Version 15\\.0\\.0\\.22021 of IGSS Data Server includes corrections for these vulnerabilities and is [available for download](https://igss.schneider-electric.com/igss/igssupdates/v150/IGSSUPDATE.ZIP)  through IGSS Master \\> Update IGSS Software. Schneider Electric recommends users use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. They strongly recommend the use of back\\-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric\u2019s [Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp)  for assistance removing a patch. If users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:* Follow the general security recommendations below and verify devices are isolated on a private network and that firewalls are configured with strict boundaries for devices that require remote access. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices.* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
