A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nA vulnerability exists that could cause a stack-based buffer overflow potentially leading to remote code execution when an attacker sends a specially crafted message.\nCVE-2022-24313 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA vulnerability exists that could cause memory leaks potentially resulting in denial of service when an attacker repeatedly sends a specially crafted message.\nCVE-2022-24314 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nA vulnerability exists that could cause denial of service when an attacker repeatedly sends a specially crafted message.\nCVE-2022-24315 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INITIALIZATION CWE-665\nA vulnerability exists that could cause information exposure when an attacker sends a specially crafted message.\nCVE-2022-24316 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862\nA vulnerability exists that could cause information exposure when an attacker sends a specific message.\nCVE-2022-24317 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nThese vulnerabilities were reported to Schneider Electric and CISA separately by Tenable, and by Vyacheslav Moskvin working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nVersion 15.0.0.22021 of IGSS Data Server includes corrections for these vulnerabilities and is available for download through IGSS Master > Update IGSS Software.\nSchneider Electric recommends users use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. They strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric\u2019s Customer Care Center for assistance removing a patch.\nIf users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:\n\nFollow the general security recommendations below and verify devices are isolated on a private network and that firewalls are configured with strict boundaries for devices that require remote access.\n\nSchneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices.\n\nLocate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the network.\nInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\nPlace all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\u00a0\nNever connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.\nScan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.\nNever allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nFor more information see Schneider Electric\u2019s security notification: SEVD-2022-039-01\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
