An authenticated attacker could brute force the password hash and use it to login to the server.[CVE\\-2021\\-40360](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-40360)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [INSERTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION INTO EXTERNALLY\\-ACCESSIBLE FILE OR DIRECTORY CWE\\-538](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/538.html) The affected component stores the credentials of a local system account in a potentially publicly accessible project file using an outdated cipher algorithm. An attacker may use this to brute force the credentials and take over the system.[CVE\\-2021\\-40363](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-40363)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.5\\.
