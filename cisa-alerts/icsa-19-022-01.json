EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Johnson Controls\nEquipment: Facility Explorer\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read, write, and delete sensitive files to gain administrator privileges in the Facility Explorer system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nFacility Explorer leverages Tridium Niagara technology, which is affected by these vulnerabilities. The following versions of Facility Explorer are affected:\n\nVersions 14.x prior to 14.4u1, and\nVersions 6.x prior to 6.6\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY (\u2018PATH TRAVERSAL\u2019) CWE-22\nA path traversal vulnerability exists that an attacker could exploit, in certain circumstances, using valid platform (administrator) credentials to access a file or directory outside of the restricted location.CVE-2017-16744 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nIn certain circumstances, an attacker could log into the local Facility Explorer platform using a disabled account name and a blank password, gaining administrator access to the Facility Explorer system.CVE-2017-16748 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTridium reported these vulnerabilities to Johnson Controls; Johnson Controls notified NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls has mitigated these vulnerabilities in the following versions. Users should upgrade to one of these product versions (FX14.6 recommended):\n\nFacility Explorer 14.6 (released September 2018)\nFacility Explorer 14.4u1 (released August 2018)\nFacility Explorer 6.6 (released August 2018)\n\nFor more information, please refer to Johnson Controls Global Product Security at https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/buildings/specialty-pages/product-security or send an email to productsecurity@jci.comJohnson Controls Services and Support:\u00a0 https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/buildings/hvac-controls\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
