MITIGATIONS\nNote: To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to gain either physical access to surveillance stations and patient monitors or access to the medical device network.\nPhilips released the following versions to remediate reported vulnerabilities:\n\nPatient Information Center iX (PICiX) Version C.03\nPerformanceBridge Focal Point\nIntelliVue Patient Monitors Versions N.00 and N.01\nIntelliVue Patient Monitors Version M.04: Contact a\u00a0Philips service support team\u00a0for an upgrade path\nCertificate revocation within the system was implemented for PIC iX and Performance Bridge FocalPoint in 2023. The implementation of the IntelliVue Patient Monitors will be completed in Q3 of 2024.\n\nAs a mitigation to these vulnerabilities, Philips recommends the following:\n\nThe Philips patient monitoring network is required to be physically or logically isolated from the hospital local area network (LAN). Philips recommends using a firewall or routers that can implement access control lists restricting access in and out of the patient monitoring network for only necessary ports and IP addresses. Refer to the Philips Patient Monitoring System Security for Clinical Networks guide for additional information on\u00a0InCenter.\nBy default, the simple certificate enrollment protocol (SCEP) service is not running. When needed, the service is configured to run based on the duration or the number of certificates to be assigned. One certificate is default, but if a certificate is not issued, the service will continue to run. Limit exposure by ensuring the SCEP service is not running unless it is actively being used to enroll new devices.\nWhen enrolling new devices using SCEP, enter a unique challenge password of 8-12 unpredictable and randomized digits.\nImplement physical security controls to prevent unauthorized login attempts on the PIC iX application. Servers should be kept in controlled locked data centers. Access to equipment at nurses' stations should be controlled and monitored.\nOnly grant remote access to PIC iX servers on a must-have basis.\nGrant login privileges to the bedside monitor and PIC iX application on a role-based, least-privilege basis, and only to trusted users.\n\nUsers with questions regarding their specific Philips Patient Information Center (PIC iX) and/or IntelliVue patient monitor installations and new release eligibility should contact their local\u00a0Philips service support team, or regional service support, or call 1-800-722-9377.\nPlease see the\u00a0Philips product security website\u00a0for the Philips advisory and the latest security information for Philips products.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nImplement physical security measures to limit or control access to critical systems.\nRestrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.\nApply defense-in-depth strategies.\nDisable unnecessary accounts and services.\nWhere additional information is needed, refer to existing\u00a0cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5.
