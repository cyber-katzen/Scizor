Each of the Service Pack and hotfixes above are available for direct download from Schneider Electric\u2019s web site at:[http://resourcecenter.controlmicrosystems.com/display/CS/SCADA\\+Expert\\+ClearSCADA\\+Downloads](http://resourcecenter.controlmicrosystems.com/display/CS/SCADA+Expert+ClearSCADA+Downloads)  More information can be found by visiting Schneider Electric\u2019s Security Notification at:[http://www.schneider\\-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD\\-2017\\-060\\-01/](http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-060-01/)  Schneider Electric recommends users include the following measures in their SCADA strategies:* Secure physical and network interfaces to the ClearSCADA system.* Deploy suitably configured firewalls between network segments to limit access to ports and protocols appropriately.* Deploy VPN technology with secure authentication on any externally accessible networks.* Configure and audit user security to reduce the risk of a denial of service.* For critical accounts use ClearSCADA security policy configuration to disable invalid logon count and delayed lockout time and to use logon throttling. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An attacker with network access to the ClearSCADA server can send specially crafted sequences of commands and data packets to the ClearSCADA server that can cause the ClearSCADA server process and ClearSCADA communications driver processes to terminate.[CVE\\-2017\\-6021](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6021)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
