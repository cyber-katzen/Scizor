[ICS Medical Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A96) ICS Medical AdvisoryMedtronic Micro Clinician and InterStim Apps============================================ Release Date March 02, 2023 Alert Code ICSMA\\-23\\-061\\-011\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.4*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Medtronic* **Equipment:**  Micros Clinician (A51200\\) app and InterStim X Clinician (A51300\\) app* **Vulnerabilities:**  Unverified Password Change2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the clinician application\u2019s custom password to be reset to default, resulting in unauthorized control of the clinician therapy application.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Medtronic Clinician App are affected:* Micro Clinician (A51200\\)* InterStim X Clinician (A51300\\)### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [UNVERIFIED PASSWORD CHANGE CWE\\-620](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/620.html)** Medtronic Clinician (A51200\\) and InterStim X Clinicain App (A51300\\) contain a vulnerability that exists under certain reset conditions, which could cause the clinician application\u2019s custom password to be reset to a default password. This could result in unauthorized control of the clinician therapy application, which has greater control over therapy parameters than the patient app. Changes still cannot be made outside of the established therapy parameters of the programmer. To gain unauthorized access, an individual would need physical access to the Smart Programmer.[CVE\\-2023\\-25931](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-25931)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Healthcare and Public Health* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Ireland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Medtronic reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- The following mitigations have been provided by Medtronic:* An app update is available as of February 23, 2023 that will fix the vulnerability.* Users should refer to the Medtronic [Security Bulletin](https://global.medtronic.com/xg-en/product-security/security-bulletins/pelvic-health-interstim-micro.html)  for the correct Medtronic Support contact for help updating the app. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  .
