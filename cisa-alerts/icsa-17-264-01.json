This patch can be found on the Schneider Electric InduSoft web site at the following location:\nhttp://download.indusoft.com/80.2.1/IWS80.2.1.zip\nSchneider Electric recommends users using InTouch Machine Edition v8.0 SP2 or prior should upgrade and apply InTouch Machine Edition v8.0 SP2 Patch 1 as soon as possible. This patch can be found on Schneider Electric\u2019s Invensys web site at the following location (registration required):\nhttps://gcsresource.invensys.com/tracking/ConfirmDownload.aspx?id=22453\nFor more information on this vulnerability and associated patch, please see InduSoft Security Bulletin LFSEC00000121 on the Schneider Electric cybersecurity web site:\nhttp://software.schneider-electric.com/support/cyber-security-updates/\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\n\nInduSoft Web Studio provides the capability for an HMI client to trigger script execution on the server for the purposes of performing customized calculations or actions. A remote malicious entity could bypass the server authentication and trigger the execution of an arbitrary command. The command is executed under high privileges and could lead to a complete compromise of the server.\nCVE-2017-13997 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nAaron Portnoy, formerly of Exodus Intelligence, discovered and reported this vulnerability to ICS-CERT.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Paris, France\n",
