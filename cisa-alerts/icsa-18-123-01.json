EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.\nVendor: Lantech\nEquipment: IDS 2102\nVulnerabilities: Improper Input Validation, Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system through crafting malicious input.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of IDS 2102, an Ethernet device server, are affected:\n\nIDS 2102 versions 2.0 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nNearly all input fields allow for arbitrary input on the device.\nCVE-2018-8869 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nA stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified which may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2018-8865 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing\nCountries/Areas Deployed: North America, Europe, Australia, and China\nCompany Headquarters Location: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nFlorian Adamsky reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nLantech has been unresponsive to NCCIC.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
