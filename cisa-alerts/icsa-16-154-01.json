[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGE MultiLink Series Hard\\-coded Credential Vulnerability======================================================== Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-154\\-01OVERVIEW-------- GE has identified a hard\\-coded credential vulnerability in GE\u2019s MultiLink series managed switches. GE has produced new firmware versions to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following MultiLink products are affected:* GE ML800 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0,* GE ML810 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0k,* GE ML1200 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0,* GE ML1600 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0,* GE ML2400 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0,* GE ML3000 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0k, and* GE ML3100 Switch, firmware versions prior to Version 5\\.5\\.0k.IMPACT------ Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative access to device configurations resulting in exposure and control of all configuration options available through the web interface. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- GE is a US\\-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world. The affected products, Multilink series switches, are managed Ethernet switches designed specifically for use in industrial facilities, substations, and transportation environments. According to GE, the Multilink series switches are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems. GE estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### USE OF HARD\\-CODED PASSWORDCWE\\-259: Use of Hard\\-coded Password, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259\\.html, web site last accessed June 02, 2016\\. The Multilink series switches have a hard\\-coded credential vulnerability, which could allow unauthorized administrative access to device configuration options available through the web interface. CVE\\-2016\\-2310NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2016\\-2310, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed June 02, 2016\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- GE has released new firmware versions for the MultiLink series managed switches that resolve the identified vulnerability. GE recommends that asset owners install firmware upgrades on affected devices. Firmware Version 5\\.5\\.0 resolves the vulnerability for the ML800, ML1200, ML1600, and ML2400\\. Firmware Version 5\\.5\\.0k resolves the vulnerability for the ML810, ML3000, and ML3100\\.

Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
