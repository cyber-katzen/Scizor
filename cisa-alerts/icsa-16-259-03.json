Trane U.S. Inc. has produced an update to mitigate this vulnerability. Maxim Rupp has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Tracer SC versions are affected:\n\nVersions 4.2.1134 and below.\n\nIMPACT\nThis vulnerability allows an unauthorized party to obtain sensitive information from the contents of configuration files not protected by the web server.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nTrane is a U.S.-based company that maintains offices throughout the U.S. It is a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand.\nThe affected product, Tracer SC, is an intelligent field panel for communicating with HVAC equipment controllers. According to Trane U.S. Inc., Tracer SC is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities and others. Trane U.S. Inc. estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINFORMATION EXPOSURECWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/668.html, web site last accessed September 15, 2016.\n\n\nContents of specific directories on the Tracer SC are exposed with the web server application to unauthenticated users. These directories have sensitive information within the configuration files.\nCVE-2016-0870NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0870, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 and a temporal score of 4.8 have been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C, web site last accessed September 15, 2016.\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nTrane U.S. Inc. has produced an update for the Tracer SC.\nIt is recommended that users contact their local Trane office for information on how to obtain this update. Please reference Trane service database number HUB-120517 when calling the local Trane office.\nIf users need assistance locating their local Trane office, please click: http://www.trane.com/commercial/north-america/us/en.html\nICS-CERT recommends updating the software/firmware to resolve the vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. Devices connected to public networks (including the Internet) should be reviewed for any sensitive and/or personal information. A risk/benefit-based decision should be made as to the information stored on devices in these public environments.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
