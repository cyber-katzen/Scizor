A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Younes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks and George Lashenko of CyberX reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation strongly encourages users to apply the latest available version of firmware to keep up to date with the latest features, anomaly fixes, and security improvements. [Update firmware to version FRN 31\\.011](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=5370&crumb=112)  which mitigates the associated risk: Rockwell Automation also recommends the following:* For EtherNet/IP\\-based vulnerabilities (ID 1\\-14\\), block all traffic to and from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222/TCP/UDP and Port 44818/TCP/UDP using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see [knowledgebase article ID 898270](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/898270/page/1)  (login required).* Stratix users can use Device Manager or Studio 5000 Logix Designer to configure access control lists (ACL) to block/restrict ports. See section \u201cAccess Control Lists\u201d in [Stratix managed switches user manual, publication 1783\\-UM007](http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/1783-um007_-en-p.pdf)  , for detailed instructions.* For web\\-based vulnerabilities (ID 15\\-17\\), block all traffic from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 80/443/TCP.* Stratix users can use Device Manager or Studio 5000 Logix Designer to configure ACL\u2019s to block/restrict ports. See section \u201cAccess Control Lists\u201d in [Stratix Managed Switches User Manual, publication 1783\\-UM007](http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/1783-um007_-en-p.pdf)  , for detailed instructions.* Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that SMTP packets from unauthorized sources are blocked.* Consult the product documentation for specific features, such as a hardware key\\-switch setting, which may be used to block unauthorized changes, etc.* Use trusted software, software patches, and antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected internet accessible control systems, please see [knowledgebase article ID 494865](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/494865/page/1)  (login required).* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that a VPN is only as secure as connected devices. For more information, please refer to Rockwell\u2019s Security Advisory: <https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1075979> (login required) CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have low attack complexity.
