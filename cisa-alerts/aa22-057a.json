Organizations should increase vigilance and evaluate their capabilities, encompassing planning, preparation, detection, and response, for such an event. This section is focused on the threat of malware using enterprise-scale distributed propagation methods and provides recommended guidance and considerations for an organization to address as part of their network architecture, security baseline, continuous monitoring, and incident response practices.\u00a0\nCISA and the FBI urge all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their cyber resilience against this threat.\nPotential Distribution Vectors\nDestructive malware may use popular communication tools to spread, including worms sent through email and instant messages, Trojan horses dropped from websites, and virus-infected files downloaded from peer-to-peer connections. Malware seeks to exploit existing vulnerabilities on systems for quiet and easy access.\nThe malware has the capability to target a large scope of systems and can execute across multiple systems throughout a network. As a result, it is important for organizations to assess their environment for atypical channels for malware delivery and/or propagation throughout their systems. Systems to assess include:\n\nEnterprise applications \u2013 particularly those that have the capability to directly interface with and impact multiple hosts and endpoints. Common examples include:\n\nPatch management systems,\nAsset management systems,\nRemote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk),\nAntivirus (AV) software,\nSystems assigned to system and network administrative personnel,\nCentralized backup servers, and\nCentralized file shares.\n\n\n\nWhile not only applicable to malware, threat actors could compromise additional resources to impact the availability of critical data and applications. Common examples include:\n\nCentralized storage devices\n\nPotential risk \u2013 direct access to partitions and data warehouses.\n\n\nNetwork devices\n\nPotential risk \u2013 capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific routes from the routing table, remove/modify, configuration attributes, or destroy firmware or system binaries\u2014which could isolate or degrade availability of critical network resources.\n\n\n\nBest Practices and Planning Strategies\nCommon strategies can be followed to strengthen an organization\u2019s resilience against destructive malware. Targeted assessment and enforcement of best practices should be employed for enterprise components susceptible to destructive malware.\nCommunication Flow\n\nEnsure proper network segmentation.\nEnsure that network-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured to permit server-to-host and host-to-host connectivity via the minimum scope of ports and protocols and that directional flows for connectivity are represented appropriately.\n\nCommunications flow paths should be fully defined, documented, and authorized.\n\n\nIncrease awareness of systems that can be used as a gateway to pivot (lateral movement) or directly connect to additional endpoints throughout the enterprise.\n\nEnsure that these systems are contained within restrictive Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), with additional segmentation and network access controls.\n\n\nEnsure that centralized network and storage devices\u2019 management interfaces reside on restrictive VLANs.\n\nLayered access control, and\nDevice-level access control enforcement \u2013 restricting access from only pre-defined VLANs and trusted IP ranges.\n\n\n\nAccess Control\n\nFor enterprise systems that can directly interface with multiple endpoints:\n\nRequire multifactor authentication for interactive logons.\nEnsure that authorized users are mapped to a specific subset of enterprise personnel.\n\nIf possible, the \u201cEveryone,\u201d \u201cDomain Users,\u201d or the \u201cAuthenticated Users\u201d groups should not be permitted the capability to directly access or authenticate to these systems.\n\n\nEnsure that unique domain accounts are used and documented for each enterprise application service.\n\nContext of permissions assigned to these accounts should be fully documented and configured based upon the concept of least privilege.\nProvides an enterprise with the capability to track and monitor specific actions correlating to an application\u2019s assigned service account.\n\n\nIf possible, do not grant a service account with local or interactive logon permissions.\n\nService accounts should be explicitly denied permissions to access network shares and critical data locations.\n\n\nAccounts that are used to authenticate to centralized enterprise application servers or devices should not contain elevated permissions on downstream systems and resources throughout the enterprise.\n\n\nContinuously review centralized file share ACLs and assigned permissions.\n\nRestrict Write/Modify/Full Control permissions when possible.\n\n\n\nMonitoring\n\nAudit and review security logs for anomalous references to enterprise-level administrative (privileged) and service accounts.\n\nFailed logon attempts,\nFile share access, and\nInteractive logons via a remote session.\n\n\nReview network flow data for signs of anomalous activity, including:\n\nConnections using ports that do not correlate to the standard communications flow associated with an application,\nActivity correlating to port scanning or enumeration, and\nRepeated connections using ports that can be used for command and control purposes.\n\n\nEnsure that network devices log and audit all configuration changes.\n\nContinually review network device configurations and rule sets to ensure that communications flows are restricted to the authorized subset of rules.\n\n\n\nFile Distribution\n\nWhen deploying patches or AV signatures throughout an enterprise, stage the distributions to include a specific grouping of systems (staggered over a pre-defined period).\n\nThis action can minimize the overall impact in the event that an enterprise patch management or AV system is leveraged as a distribution vector for a malicious payload.\n\n\nMonitor and assess the integrity of patches and AV signatures that are distributed throughout the enterprise.\n\nEnsure updates are received only from trusted sources,\nPerform file and data integrity checks, and\nMonitor and audit \u2013 as related to the data that is distributed from an enterprise application.\n\n\n\nSystem and Application Hardening\n\nEnsure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place.\u00a0\n\nCISA maintains a living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities. In addition to thoroughly testing and implementing vendor patches in a timely\u2014and, if possible, automated\u2014 manner, organizations should ensure patching of the vulnerabilities CISA includes in this catalog.\n\n\nEnsure that the underlying operating system (OS) and dependencies (e.g., Internet Information Services [IIS], Apache, Structured Query Language [SQL]) supporting an application are configured and hardened based upon industry-standard best practice recommendations. Implement application-level security controls based on best practice guidance provided by the vendor. Common recommendations include:\n\nUse role-based access control,\nPrevent end-user capabilities to bypass application-level security controls,\n\nFor example, do not allow users to disable AV on local workstations.\n\n\nRemove, or disable unnecessary or unused features or packages, and\nImplement robust application logging and auditing.\n\n\n\nRecovery and Reconstitution Planning\nA business impact analysis (BIA) is a key component of contingency planning and preparation. The overall output of a BIA will provide an organization with two key components (as related to critical mission/business operations):\n\nCharacterization and classification of system components, and\nInterdependencies.\n\nBased upon the identification of an organization\u2019s mission critical assets (and their associated interdependencies), in the event that an organization is impacted by destructive malware, recovery and reconstitution efforts should be considered.\nTo plan for this scenario, an organization should address the availability and accessibility for the following resources (and should include the scope of these items within incident response exercises and scenarios):\n\nComprehensive inventory of all mission critical systems and applications:\n\nVersioning information,\nSystem/application dependencies,\nSystem partitioning/storage configuration and connectivity, and\nAsset owners/points of contact.\n\n\nContact information for all essential personnel within the organization,\nSecure communications channel for recovery teams,\nContact information for external organizational-dependent resources:\n\nCommunication providers,\nVendors (hardware/software), and\nOutreach partners/external stakeholders\n\n\nService contract numbers \u2013 for engaging vendor support,\nOrganizational procurement points of contact,\nOptical disc image (ISO)/image files for baseline restoration of critical systems and applications:\n\nOS installation media,\nService packs/patches,\nFirmware, and\nApplication software installation packages.\n\n\nLicensing/activation keys for OS and dependent applications,\nEnterprise network topology and architecture diagrams,\nSystem and application documentation,\nHard copies of operational checklists and playbooks,\nSystem and application configuration backup files,\nData backup files (full/differential),\nSystem and application security baseline and hardening checklists/guidelines, and\nSystem and application integrity test and acceptance checklists.\n\nIncident Response\nVictims of a destructive malware attacks should immediately focus on containment to reduce the scope of affected systems. Strategies for containment include:\n\nDetermining a vector common to all systems experiencing anomalous behavior (or having been rendered unavailable)\u2014from which a malicious payload could have been delivered:\n\nCentralized enterprise application,\nCentralized file share (for which the identified systems were mapped or had access),\nPrivileged user account common to the identified systems,\nNetwork segment or boundary, and\nCommon Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution.\n\n\nBased upon the determination of a likely distribution vector, additional mitigation controls can be enforced to further minimize impact:\n\nImplement network-based ACLs to deny the identified application(s) the capability to directly communicate with additional systems,\n\nProvides an immediate capability to isolate and sandbox specific systems or resources.\n\n\nImplement null network routes for specific IP addresses (or IP ranges) from which the payload may be distributed,\n\nAn organization\u2019s internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, as a null pointer record could be added within a DNS zone for an identified server or application.\n\n\nReadily disable access for suspected user or service account(s),\nFor suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or disable the share path from being accessed by additional systems, and\nBe prepared to, if necessary, reset all passwords and tickets within directories (e.g., changing golden/silver tickets).\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs related to incident response and incident handling, organizations are encouraged to report incidents to the FBI and CISA (see the Contact section below) and to preserve forensic data for use in internal investigation of the incident or for possible law enforcement purposes. See Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more information.\n\nContact Information\n\nOrganizations can also report anomalous cyber activity and/or cyber incidents 24/7 to\u00a0report@cisa.gov\u00a0or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472) and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI\u2019s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\nResources\n\nJoint CSA: Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure\nJoint CSA: NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across Operational Technologies and Control Systems\nJoint CSA: Ongoing Cyber Threats to U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems\nCISA and MS-ISAC: Joint Ransomware Guide\nCISA webpage: Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories\nNIST: Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other Destructive Events\nNIST: Data Integrity: Recovering from Ransomware and Other Destructive Events\nCISA Cyber hygiene services: CISA offers a range of no-cost services to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.

The binaries are predominantly .Net and are obfuscated. Obfuscation varies; some of the binaries contain multiple layers of obfuscation. Analysis identified multiple uses of string reversal, character replacement, base64 encoding, and packing. Additionally, the malicious binaries contain multiple defenses including VM checks, sandbox detection and evasion, and anti-debugging techniques. Finally, the sleep command was used in varying lengths via PowerShell to obfuscate execution on a victim\u2019s network.\u00a0All Microsoft .doc files contain a malicious macro that is base64 encoded. Upon enabling the macro, a PowerShell script runs a sleep command and then downloads a file from an external site. The script connects to the external website via HTTP to download an executable. Upon download, the executable is saved to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ filepath on the victim host.\u00a0An identified zip file was found to contain the Microsoft Word file macro_t1smud.doc. Once the macro is enabled, a bash script runs a sleep command and the script connects to htxxps://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe. This binary is likely the legitimate Putty Secure Shell binary. Upon download the file is saved to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ file path.\nProfile of Malicious Hashes\n\nSaintbot (and related .Net loaders)\u00a0\nWhisperGate Malware and related VB
