The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '\\<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to deliver a malicious payload.
