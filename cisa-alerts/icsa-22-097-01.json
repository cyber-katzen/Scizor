The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '\\<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to deliver a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '\\<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string.[CVE\\-2012\\-6708](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-6708)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
