EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Pepperl+Fuchs\nEquipment: WirelessHART-Gateway\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-critical Action, Path Traversal, Cross-site Scripting, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie, HTTP Request Smuggling, Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag, Cryptographic Issues\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in a denial-of-service condition, code execution, and code exposure.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of WirelessHART-Gateway industrial networking devices are affected:\n\nWHA-GW-F2D2-0-AS- Z2-ETH: Versions 3.0.7, 3.0.8, 3.0.9\nWHA-GW-F2D2-0-AS- Z2-ETH.EIP: Versions 3.0.7, 3.0.8, 3.0.9\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe affected product allows active SSH and telnet services with hard-coded credentials.\nCVE-2021-34565 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\njQuery 3.0.0-rc.1 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition due to removing a logic a lowercased attribute names. Any attribute using a mixed-cased name for boolean attributes goes into an infinite recursion, exceeding the stack call limit.\nCVE-2016-10707 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RELIANCE ON REVERSE DNS RESOLUTION FOR A SECURITY-CRITICAL ACTION CWE-350\nIf the application is not externally accessible or uses IP-based access restrictions, attackers can use DNS rebinding to bypass any IP or firewall-based access restrictions by proxying through their target's browser. This vulnerability only affects Versions 3.0.7 through 3.0.8.\nCVE-2021-34561 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nThe filename parameter is vulnerable to unauthenticated path traversal attacks, enabling read access to arbitrary files on the server. This vulnerability only affects Version 3.0.7.\nCVE-2021-33555 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\njQuery Version 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting attacks via vectors related to use of the text method.\nCVE-2014-6071 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to deliver a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string.\nCVE-2012-6708 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\njQuery versions prior to 3.0.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option, causing text/javascript responses to be executed.\nCVE-2015-9251 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIn jQuery versions between 1.0.3 and 3.5.0, passing HTML containing <option> elements from untrusted sources (even after sanitizing it) to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e., .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIn jQuery versions between 1.2 and 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources (even after sanitizing it) to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This vulnerability is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.\nCVE-2020-11022 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\njQuery versions prior to 3.4.0, as used in specific products, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution.

A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\njQuery versions prior to 1.9.0 allow cross-site scripting attacks via the load method. The load method fails to recognize and remove \"<script>\" HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, \"</script >\", which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed.\nCVE-2020-7656 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.12\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nThe affected product contains a password field with autocomplete enabled.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.14\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INCONSISTENT INTERPRETATION OF HTTP REQUESTS ('HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING') CWE-444\nIn the affected product, Versions 3.0.7 through 3.0.8 have a vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to rewrite links and URLs in cached pages to arbitrary strings.\nCVE-2021-34559 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.15\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nIn the affected product, Version 3.0.8, it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response.\nCVE-2021-34562 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
