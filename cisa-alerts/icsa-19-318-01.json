EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.1\nATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Mentor Nucleus Networking Module\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to affect the integrity and availability of the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following networking modules from Mentor Nucleus (a division of Siemens) are affected:\n\nNucleus NET: All versions\nNucleus RTOS: All versions\nNucleus ReadyStart for ARM, MIPS, and PPC: All versions prior to v2017.02.2 with patch \u201cNucleus 2017.02.02 Nucleus NET Patch\u201d\nNucleus SafetyCert: All versions\nNucleus Source Code: All versions\nVSTAR: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nBy sending specially crafted DHCP packets to a device, an attacker may be able to affect availability and integrity of the device. Attackers require adjacent network access to exploit this vulnerability, but do not require authentication or user interaction.\nCVE-2019-13939 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nArmis reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends installing the following software updates to address this vulnerability.\nNucleus NET:\n\nAvoid using DHCP Client of Nucleus NET or upgrade Nucleus ReadyStart and apply the corresponding patch.\n\nNucleus RTOS:\n\nAvoid using DHCP Client of Nucleus NET, or upgrade Nucleus ReadyStart and apply the corresponding patch.\n\nNucleus ReadyStart for ARM, MIPS, and PPC:\n\nUpgrade to v2017.02.2 and install the patch \u201cNucleus 2017.02.02 Nucleus NET Patch.\u201d Updated firmware versions can be obtained from Mentor supportcenter at (login required):\n\nhttps://support.mentor.com/en/product/1009925838/downloads\nNucleus SafetyCert:\n\nNucleus SafetyCert is not affected since it leverages the LWNET stack, which is not affected. The Nucleus SafetyCert bundle, however, does include a copy of Nucleus ReadyStart to allow easier prototyping, which is affected.\n\nNucleus Source Code:\n\nAvoid using DHCP Client of Nucleus NET.\n\nVSTAR:\n\nContact customer support to receive patch and update instructions.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-434032 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
