A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [BUFFER UNDERWRITE ('BUFFER UNDERFLOW') CWE\\-124](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/124.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Existing CommBuffer checks in SmmEntryPoint will not catch underflow when computing BufferSize.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-38578](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38578) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An issue was discovered in IhisiSmm in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5\\.0 through 5\\.5\\. IHISI function 0x17 verifies that the output buffer lies within the command buffer but does not verify that output data does not go beyond the end of the command buffer. In particular, the GetFlashTable function is called directly on the Command Buffer before the DataSize is check, leading to possible circumstances where the data immediately following the command buffer could be destroyed before returning a buffer size error.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-24350](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24350) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

InsydeH2O does not use the FreeType API at runtime and usage during build time does not produce a vulnerability in the BIOS. The CVSS reflects this limited usage.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-27405](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-27405) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This issue was discovered by Insyde during security review.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-29275](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29275) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The code which uses can be inside of SMM, making the working buffer untrusted input. The buffer can be corrupted by DMA transfers. The SMM code code attempts to sanitize pointers to ensure all pointers refer to the working buffer, but when a pointer is not found in the list of pointers to sanitize, the current action is not aborted, leading to undefined behavior. This issue was discovered by Insyde engineering based on the general description provided by Intel's iSTARE group.
