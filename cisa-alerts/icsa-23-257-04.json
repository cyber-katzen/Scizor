IHISI function 0x17 verifies that the output buffer lies within the command buffer but does not verify that output data does not go beyond the end of the command buffer. In particular, the GetFlashTable function is called directly on the Command Buffer before the DataSize is check, leading to possible circumstances where the data immediately following the command buffer could be destroyed before returning a buffer size error.[CVE\\-2022\\-24350](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24350)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This TOCTOU attack could be used to alter data and code used by the remainder of the boot process.[CVE\\-2022\\-24351](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24351)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)** Some versions of InsydeH2O use the FreeType tools to embed fonts into the BIOS. InsydeH2O does not use the FreeType API at runtime and usage during build time does not produce a vulnerability in the BIOS. The CVSS reflects this limited usage.[CVE\\-2022\\-27405](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-27405)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)** In UsbCoreDxe, untrusted input may allow SMRAM or OS memory tampering Use of untrusted pointers could allow OS or SMRAM memory tampering leading to escalation of privileges. This issue was discovered by Insyde during security review.[CVE\\-2022\\-29275](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-29275)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The code which uses can be inside of SMM, making the working buffer untrusted input. The buffer can be corrupted by DMA transfers. The SMM code code attempts to sanitize pointers to ensure all pointers refer to the working buffer, but when a pointer is not found in the list of pointers to sanitize, the current action is not aborted, leading to undefined behavior. This issue was discovered by Insyde engineering based on the general description provided by Intel's iSTARE group.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens has released [BIOS update V1\\.0\\.212N](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/in/en/view/109814796)  for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest version. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-957369 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-957369.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-957369.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
