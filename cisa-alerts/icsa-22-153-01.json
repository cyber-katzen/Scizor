A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DIRECT REQUEST ('FORCED BROWSING') CWE-425\nAn unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted network packet to delete a user from the web interface.\nCVE-2022-31484 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DIRECT REQUEST ('FORCED BROWSING') CWE-425\nAn unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted packet to update the \u201cnotes\u201d section on the home page of the web interface.\nCVE-2022-31485 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nAn authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted route to a specific binary causing it to execute shell commands.\nCVE-2022-31486 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSam Quinn @eAyeP and Steve Povolny @spovolny from Trellix Threat Labs reported these vulnerabilities to Carrier.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCarrier recommends updating these access panels to the most current released firmware via the LenelS2 Partner Center. Please contact a Carrier support channel partner for instructions.\nThe controller can also be configured to disable web access, which prevents remote login into the controller\u2019s webpage. To log in, see the specific instructions in CARR-PSA-006-0622\nCarrier has published CARR-PSA-006-0622 to notify users about these vulnerabilities, providing additional mitigation instructions.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
