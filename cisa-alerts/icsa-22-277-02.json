EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM)\nVulnerabilities: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), HTTP Response Splitting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform malicious command injection, trick a valid user into downloading malicious software onto their computer. Successful exploitation may also allow an attacker to pose as a legitimate user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MSM, a monitoring system for high voltage switchgear, are affected:\n\nMSM version 2.2 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\nThe affected product is vulnerable to cross site request forgery (CSRF), which if exploited could lead an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web application and perform an unauthorized action without the knowledge of the legitimate user.\nCVE-2021-40335 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF CRLF SEQUENCES IN HTTP HEADERS ('HTTP REQUEST/RESPONSE SPLITTING') CWE-113\nThe affected product is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting, which if exploited, could lead an attacker to inject harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser for purposes such as stealing session cookies.\nCVE-2021-40336 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy recommends security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a network from attacks originating outside the network:\n\nPhysically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.\nEnsure process control systems have no direct connections to the internet.\nUse firewall systems to separate process control systems from other networks.\nEnsure the firewall system only has necessary ports exposed.\n\nMSM should only be used to access the internet for authorized information. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a network.\nLinks used for access to an MSM system should not be sent by email; links to MSM should not be opened. Suspicious emails should be reported to the IT administrator.\nFor more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000T085.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.\n",
