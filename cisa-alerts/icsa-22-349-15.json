EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment: Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\n\u202fSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead the application to crash or lead to arbitrary code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the following viewing and lifecycle management products are affected because they contain the APDFL library from Datalogics, which is affected by these vulnerabilities:\n\nJT2Go: All versions prior to V14.1.0.5\nTeamcenter Visualization V13.3: All versions prior to V13.3.0.8\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.0: All versions prior to V14.0.0.4\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.1: All versions prior to V14.1.0.5\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe APDFL.dll contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-3159 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe APDFL.dll contains an out-of-bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-3160 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3 IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe APDFL.dll contains a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2022-3161 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinz and Nafiez reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:\n\nJT2Go: Update to V14.1.0.5 or later version.\nTeamcenter Visualization V13.3: Update to V13.3.0.8 or later version.\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.0: Update to V14.0.0.4 or later version.\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.1: Update to V14.1.0.5 or later version.\n\nSiemens identified the following specific workaround and mitigation user can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nDo not open untrusted PDF files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Siemens also provides additional information on industrial security.\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact Siemens.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-360681 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
