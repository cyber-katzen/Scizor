RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead the application to crash or lead to arbitrary code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports the following viewing and lifecycle management products are affected because they contain the APDFL library from Datalogics, which is affected by these vulnerabilities:* JT2Go: All versions prior to V14\\.1\\.0\\.5* Teamcenter Visualization V13\\.3: All versions prior to V13\\.3\\.0\\.8* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.0: All versions prior to V14\\.0\\.0\\.4* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.1: All versions prior to V14\\.1\\.0\\.5### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### **3\\.2\\.1 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)** The APDFL.dll contains a stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could be triggered while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-3159](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3159)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.2 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)** The APDFL.dll contains an out\\-of\\-bounds write past the fixed\\-length heap\\-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-3160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3160)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)** The APDFL.dll contains a memory corruption vulnerability while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2022\\-3161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3161)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinz and Nafiez reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions:* JT2Go: [Update to V14\\.1\\.0\\.5 or later version](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html)  .* Teamcenter Visualization V13\\.3: [Update to V13\\.3\\.0\\.8 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  .* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.0: [Update to V14\\.0\\.0\\.4 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  .* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.1: [Update to V14\\.1\\.0\\.5 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)  . Siemens identified the following specific workaround and mitigation user can apply to reduce risk:* Do not open untrusted PDF files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Siemens also provides [additional information on industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  . For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories)  . For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-360681 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-360681.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-360681.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
