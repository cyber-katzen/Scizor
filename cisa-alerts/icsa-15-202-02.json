[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens Sm@rtClient Password Storage Vulnerability================================================== Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-202\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Siemens has identified a password storage vulnerability in its Sm@rtClient Android application. This vulnerability was reported directly to Siemens by Karsten Sohr from Universit\u00e4t Bremen and Stephan Huber from Fraunhofer SIT. Siemens has produced a new version to mitigate this vulnerability. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient:* SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient for Android: All versions prior to V01\\.00\\.01\\.00,* SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient Lite for Android: All versions prior to V01\\.00\\.01\\.00\\.IMPACT------ A local attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to retrieve Sm@rtServer\\-specific passwords stored on the mobile device. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. The affected products, SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient applications, in combination with the SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtServer, allow remote mobile operation and observation of SIMATIC HMI systems. According to Siemens, the SIMATIC WinCC\u00a0Sm@rtClient applications are deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE\\-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522\\.html, web site last accessed July 21, 2015\\. The existing storage technique for Sm@rtServer\\-specific passwords could allow attackers to extract the password if local access to the mobile device was available.

Specifically, users should:* Employ strong passwords on portable devices.* Carefully select and use security applications on portable devices.* Be selective of other apps loaded on the same portable device.* Create multiple user accounts on shared devices.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
