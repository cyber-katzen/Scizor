[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SIMATIC PLCs Reported Issues Summary (Update A)======================================================= Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-11\\-223\\-01AOverview-------- ICS\\-CERT has been coordinating multiple reports of issues affecting various models within the Siemens SIMATIC Step 7 (S7\\) programmable logic controller (PLC) product line. ICS\\-CERT has coordinated the issues with both Siemens and the researcher and continues to work with both entities. A portion of the reported issues involve commands being transmitted using the International Organization for Standardization Transport Service Access Point (ISO\\-TSAP) protocol. According to ICS\\-CERT analysis, the ISO\\-TSAP protocol is functioning to specifications; however, authentication is not performed nor are payloads encrypted or obfuscated. Like ISO\\-TSAP, many protocols used in industrial control systems (ICSs) were designed with interoperability in mind and were intentionally designed without security features to be as open as possible. As a result, improving ICS security may require extensive architectural changes, including the addition of built\\-in or layered\\-on techniques to enhance protocol security. Changes necessary to improve protocol security could negatively impact interoperability and performance. Some of the reported issues were coordinated and resolved with ICS\\-CERT and Siemens, while others were publicly released by the researcher without coordination. ICS\\-CERT\u2019s [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](/control_systems/ics-cert/disclosure.html)  encourages researchers to work directly with ICS\\-CERT and/or the affected vendor to disclose previously unknown vulnerabilities, so that patches and mitigations can be prepared and asset owners have adequate time to test and deploy them. Unless extenuating circumstances arise (e.g., active exploitation, threats of an especially serious nature, or danger to public health and safety), coordinated vulnerabilities are not publicly announced until patches/mitigations are available. The intent of this advisory is to provide a summary of the various alerts and notices as well as other public information available to date. Some ICS\\-CERT products related to these reports are only available on the US\\-CERT Portal. Asset owners and operators can request access to the US\\-CERT Portal by sending an e\\-mail message to [ICS\\-CERT@DHS.GOV](mailto:ICS-CERT@DHS.GOV)  . Table 1 outlines the public ICS\\-CERT Alerts that are currently available on the ICS\\-CERT website. Additional ICS\\-CERT products are available on the US\\-CERT Portal.*Table 1\\.

Please refer to ICS\\-CERT and Siemens statements provided in the Overview section Tables 1 and 2 and the Vulnerability Characterization section for information specific to each issue.Impact------ Multiple issues affecting the Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLC product line cause a variety of potential impacts. All reported issues require the attacker to have direct access to the PLC or access to the automation network to be successful. Access to the automation network allows an attacker complete control of the PLC, with the ability to execute unauthorized commands and read/write memory on the PLC. These unauthorized changes can result in the loss of process control, possibly causing damage to critical ICSs. SIMATIC S7 PLCs can be installed in a myriad of applications ranging from food and beverage processing to energy utilities. Therefore, the exact impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on the environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLCs are used in a variety of industrial applications worldwide, including energy, water and wastewater, oil and gas, chemical, building automation, and manufacturing.Vulnerability Characterization------------------------------### Vulnerability Overview This section categorizes all reported issues affecting the SIMATIC S7 product line that have been publicly disclosed. This section only includes reports that have been verified. Reported vulnerabilities that are unverified or still being coordinated with Siemens are not included here and are currently being handled in accordance with ICS\\-CERT\u2019s vulnerability policy. Proof\\-of\\-concept modules have been developed to demonstrate many of the reported issues. These modules would lower the difficulty of exploitation. ICS\\-CERT is not aware that any of these modules are publicly available at this time. ICS\\-CERT has categorized each of the reported issues into one of four general categories.**1\\. Use of an Open Communication Protocol**  This category relates to the use of an open protocol, ISO\\-TSAP, for communications. ISO\\-TSAP was not designed to be a secure protocol and is open to analysis. A PLC, its supporting engineering workstation software, and other tools are required to conduct this analysis. If the PLC is not configured with password protection, any command that can be sent from the engineering workstation can be captured, modified, and replayed to the PLC.**2\\. Bypass of a Password Protection Mechanism**  This category relates to the ability to bypass a password mechanism that is in place to prevent unauthorized access to commands and actions on the PLC.**3\\. Denial\\-of\\-Service (DoS) Attacks Putting the PLC into the Stop/Defective State**  This category relates to DoS attacks that put the PLC into a defective state. The DoS issues do not exist because of the open protocol specification but are the result of the implementation or usage of the protocol.**4\\. Access to Embedded Software within the PLC and Hardcoded Credentials**  This category relates to access to software that Siemens has embedded into the PLC, generally to support troubleshooting and diagnostics of the PLC. The following tables address each of the publicly reported and verified vulnerabilities by category, affected models/versions, and the associated information product.#### Use of an Open Communication Protocol*Table 3\\. Use of an open communication protocol.* | **Description** | **M**  **odels Affected** | **I**  **CS\\-CERT Product** || --- | --- | --- || **Read/Write of Memory** | **Confirmed**  * S7\\-1200 | Portal Alert    Web Alert:  [ICS\\-ALERT\\-11\\-186\\-01](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-11-186-01) ||  | **Unconfirmed**  * S7\\-200 * S7\\-300 * S7\\-400 || The ability to read and write PLC memory is allowed due to the design decision made to use ISO\\-TSAP, an inherently open protocol. Although this is commonly referred to as a vulnerability, ICS\\-CERT does not see this as a vulnerability in the protocol itself because the protocol was never designed to provide security or obfuscation. However, devices that implement this protocol have been shown to be vulnerable to exploitation. | | || **Execution of commands over a clear\\-text, unauthenticated protocol** | * S7\\-200 * S7\\-300 * S7\\-400 * S7\\-1200 | Portal Alert    Web Alert:  [ICS\\-ALERT\\-11\\-186\\-01](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-11-186-01) || The ability to send commands to the PLC is allowed due to the design decision made to use ISO\\-TSAP, an inherently open protocol. Although this is commonly referred to as a vulnerability, ICS\\-CERT does not see this as a vulnerability in the protocol itself because the protocol was never designed to provide security or obfuscation. However, devices that implement this protocol have been shown to be vulnerable to exploitation. | | |### Bypass of a Password Protection Mechanism Table 4\\.

This shell gives the attacker the ability to perform various internal diagnostic functions and extract the contents of memory from the PLC. | | |#### Unconfirmed Potential Vulnerabilities ICS\\-CERT is aware of reports of other potential vulnerabilities that are claimed to affect SIMATIC S7 PLCs. This information has not been coordinated directly with ICS\\-CERT or with Siemens. The available information relating to other potential vulnerabilities is being reviewed and evaluated by ICS\\-CERT and Siemens and, therefore, is not yet ready for public release.Mitigation---------- Both ICS\\-CERT and Siemens take these issues seriously and are working together to prepare a path forward for these and future issues. Currently, one patch is available that addresses two of the reported issues that affect S7\\-1200 PLCs.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Because of the design decisions made in the control system industry in the past to foster interoperability, it will not be possible to provide near\\-term patches for all of the reported issues.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** In some cases, attempting to retrofit or patch these devices could break the communications required, potentially resulting in a loss of process control. For cases where patching is not possible, some near\\-term mitigations will be in the form of defense\\-in\\-depth practices until long\\-term architectural changes can be safely adopted, developed, and deployed. Users of the Siemens SIMATIC S7 product line should consider employing all currently available mitigation strategies. These strategies include a patch developed by Siemens and other defensive measures to harden the automation network environment. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT continues to coordinate with Siemens to evaluate long\\-term mitigations, including patches, for remaining open issues.#### Siemens Patch for the SIMATIC S7\\-1200 Siemens has released a patch that addresses two of the reported issues in the S7\\-1200 PLC. ICS\\-CERT has confirmed that the patch successfully resolves the bypass of a PLC password protection algorithm and DoS vulnerability, as reported by the researcher, in the web server that is embedded in the PLC firmware. Where possible, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users of S7\\-1200 PLCs apply the patch developed by Siemens to help protect against potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
