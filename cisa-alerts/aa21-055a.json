According to Accellion, this activity\u00a0involves attackers leveraging four vulnerabilities to target FTA customers.[8] In one incident, an attack on an SLTT organization potentially included the breach of confidential organizational data. In some instances observed, the attacker has subsequently extorted money from victim organizations to prevent public release of information exfiltrated from the Accellion appliance.\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) and recommended mitigations for this malicious activity. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: AA21-055B.stix and MAR-10325064-1.v1.stix.\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nAccellion FTA is a file transfer application that is used to share files. In mid-December 2020, Accellion was made aware of a zero-day vulnerability in Accellion FTA and released a patch on December 23, 2020. Since then, Accellion has identified cyber actors targeting FTA customers by leveraging the following additional vulnerabilities.\n\nCVE-2021-27101 \u2013 Structured Query Language (SQL) injection via a crafted HOST header (affects FTA 9_12_370 and earlier)\nCVE-2021-27102 \u2013 Operating system command execution via a local web service call (affects FTA versions 9_12_411 and earlier)\nCVE-2021-27103 \u2013 Server-side request forgery via a crafted POST request (affects FTA 9_12_411 and earlier)\nCVE-2021-27104 \u2013 Operating system command execution via a crafted POST request (affects FTA 9_12_370 and earlier)\n\nOne of the exploited vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-27101) is an SQL injection vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to run remote commands on targeted devices. Actors have exploited this vulnerability to deploy a webshell on compromised systems. The webshell is located on the target system in the file /home/httpd/html/about.html or /home/seos/courier/about.html. The webshell allows the attacker to send commands to targeted devices, exfiltrate data, and clean up logs. The clean-up functionality of the webshell helps evade detection and analysis during post incident response. The Apache /var/opt/cache/rewrite.log file may also contain the following evidence of compromise:\n\n[.'))union(select(c_value)from(t_global)where(t_global.c_param)=('w1'))] (1) pass through /courier/document_root.html\n[.'))union(select(reverse(c_value))from(t_global)where(t_global.c_param)=('w1'))] (1) pass through /courier/document_root.html\n['))union(select(loc_id)from(net1.servers)where(proximity)=(0))] (1) pass through /courier/document_root.html\n\nThese entries are followed shortly by a pass-through request to sftp_account_edit.php. The entries are the SQL injection attempt indicating an attempt at exploitation of the HTTP header parameter HTTP_HOST.\nApache access logging shows successful file listings and file exfiltration:\n\n\u201cGET /courier/about.html?aid=1000 HTTP/1.1\u201d 200 {Response size}\n\u201cGET /courier/about.htmldwn={Encrypted Path}&fn={encrypted file name} HTTP/1.1\u201d 200 {Response size}\n\nWhen the clean-up function is run, it modifies archived Apache access logs /var/opt/apache/c1s1-access_log.*.gz and replaces the file contents with the following string:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Binary file (standard input) matches\nIn two incidents, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) observed a large amount of data transferred over port 443 from federal agency IP addresses to 194.88.104[.]24. In one incident, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore observed multiple TCP sessions with IP address 45.135.229[.]179.\nOrganizations are encouraged to investigate the IOCs outlined in this advisory and in AR21-055A. If an Accellion FTA appears compromised, organizations can get an indication of the exfiltrated files by obtaining a list of file-last-accessed events for the target files of the symlinks located in the /home/seos/apps/1000/ folder over the period of malicious activity. This information is only indicative and may not be a comprehensive identifier of all exfiltrated files.\n\nMitigations\n\nOrganizations with Accellion FTA should:\n\nTemporarily isolate or block internet access to and from systems hosting the software.\nAssess the system for evidence of malicious activity including the IOCs, and obtain a snapshot or forensic disk image of the system for subsequent investigation.\nIf malicious activity is identified, obtain a snapshot or forensic disk image of the system for subsequent investigation, then:\n\nConsider conducting an audit of Accellion FTA user accounts for any unauthorized changes, and consider resetting user passwords.\nReset any security tokens on the system, including the \u201cW1\u201d encryption token, which may have been exposed through SQL injection.\n\n\nUpdate Accellion FTA to version FTA_9_12_432 or later.\nEvaluate potential solutions for migration to a supported file-sharing platform after completing appropriate testing.\n\nAccellion has announced that FTA will reach end-of-life (EOL) on April 30, 2021.[9]\u00a0Replacing software and firmware/hardware before it reaches EOL significantly reduces risks and costs.\n\n\n\nAdditional general best practices include:\n\nDeploying automated software update tools to ensure that third-party software on all systems is running the most recent security updates provided by the software vendor.\nOnly using up-to-date and trusted third-party components for the software developed by the organization.\nAdding additional security controls to prevent the access from unauthenticated sources.\n\nResources\n\nFireEye Blog \u2013 Cyber Criminals Exploit Accellion FTA for Data Theft and Extortion\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html\u00a0\n\n\nCenter for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense, known as \"CIS Controls\"\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/controls/\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac/\n\n\nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States Joint Advisory on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity\u00a0\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a\u00a0\n\n\nCISA and MS-ISAC\u2019s Ransomware Guide\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C.pdf\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\n[2] New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NZ NCSC)\n[3] Singapore Cyber Security Agency (CSA)\n[4] United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (UK NCSC)\n[5] United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n[6] United States Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)\n[7] Accellion Press Release: Update to Recent FTA Security Incident \n[8] Accellion Press Release: Update to Recent FTA Security Incident\n[9] Accellion Announcement: End-of-Life for Legacy FTA Software\n\nRevisions\n\nFebruary 24, 2021: Initial Version|June 17, 2021:  Replaced STIX file to remove an IOC reported as non-malicious.\n",
