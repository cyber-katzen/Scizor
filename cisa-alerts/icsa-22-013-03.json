MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens Energy has indicated no remediation is planned. Siemens Energy has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* PLUSCONTROL devices are typically located in a separate LAN segment of energy transmission solutions, where an attacker could use these vulnerabilities to disrupt SER messages or Trace functionalities. Therefore, review the status of the [defense\\-in\\-depth recommendations](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  as they apply specific deployments and align as needed. Users are encouraged to pay special attention to the measures on the network layer to prevent accessibility from other network segments. As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. Users are advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-845392](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-845392.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
