MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric released TriStation v4\\.9\\.1 and v4\\.10\\.1 on May 30, 2013 and 4\\.13\\.0 on January 26, 2015 to address these issues. Tricon v10\\.5\\.0 was released on August 13, 2009 and v10\\.5\\.4 on February 2, 2012 to address the issues. Schneider Electric notified customers of updated product availability via direct\\-to\\-customer notification and fixed versions of these offers are available for download [here](https://pasupport.schneider-electric.com/)  . Schneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or nodes connected to these networks.* Never allow laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as virtual private networks. Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should therefore be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. Schneider Electric continues to recommend users always implement the instructions in the \u201cSecurity Considerations,\u201d which include the following:* Ensure the cybersecurity features in Triconex solutions are always enabled.* Always deploy safety systems on isolated networks.* Secure all TriStation engineering workstations and never connect to any network other than the safety network.* Configure operator stations to display an alarm whenever the Tricon key switch is in the \u201cPROGRAM\u201d mode. Please see the [Schneider Electric Security Bulletin \u2013 SESB\\-2020\\-105\\-01](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SESB-2020-105-01/)  for more details of these vulnerabilities in legacy Triconex products. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
