EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Fuji Electric\nEquipment: Alpha5\nVulnerabilities: Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Out-of-bound Read, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information and execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Fuji Electric\u2019s Alpha5, a servo drive system, are affected:\n\nAlpha5: All versions prior to 4.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nThe affected product is vulnerable due to an invalid pointer initialization, which may lead to information disclosure.\nCVE-2022-21168 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may result in disclosure of sensitive information.\nCVE-2022-21202 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may result in code execution.\nCVE-2022-24383 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2022-21228 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution.\nCVE-2022-21214 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nXina1i, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFuji Electric recommends upgrading to Alpha5 v4.4. The files can be obtained in the Fuji Library.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
