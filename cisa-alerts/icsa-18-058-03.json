This can possibly result in a loss of system availability and disruption in communications with other connected devices.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability caused by sending crafted packets on Port 20547 could force the PLC to change its state into halt mode.\nCVE-2018-5452 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nYounes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Minnesota, USA\nMITIGATION\nEmerson offers the following mitigation advice:\n\nAssess which ControlWave products in your organization have Ethernet connectivity.\nUpgrade the affected devices to firmware version 05.79.00 to correct this possible action. System firmware upgrade instructions are available in product documentation (ControlWave Micro Process Automation Controller Instruction Manual, part D301392X012).\nThe resolution described is available only to the user when appropriately incorporated into the application running in ControlWave Micro firmware.\nPrior to upgrading the system firmware, always perform a full alarm and historical collection (archive files as well as audit logs).\n\nThe release notes and firmware upgrade are available to registered users at the following link:\nhttp://www3.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/v2/login.html.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
