EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 4 ---------\n\nVulnerability: Insufficient Resource Pool\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 4 ---------\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-19-281-03 Siemens SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 that was published October 8, 2019, on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack that could compromise the availability of the service provided by the software.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010, software controller for PC-based automation solutions, are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 ---------\n\nSIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 all versions prior to SP3 Update 1\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 4 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 4 ---------\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSUFFICIENT RESOURCE POOL CWE-410\nAn unauthenticated attacker sending a large HTTP request to the host where WinAC RTX is running may trigger a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2019-13921 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 4 ---------\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nTal Keren from Claroty reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 ---------\nSiemens recommends installing the following software update to address this vulnerability:\n\nUpdate to SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010: SP3 Update 1\n\n--------- End Update A Part 4\u00a0of 4 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nRestrict network access to the host containing the affected service.\nIf the service is not used as a server, configure Windows Firewall to disable communications on the port of the vulnerable service.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-878278 at the following location: http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
