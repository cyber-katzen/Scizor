EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Siveillance Identity\nVulnerabilities: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access or modify several internal application resources.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siveillance Identity, a web-based self-service portal, are affected:\n\nSiveillance Identity v1.5: All versions\u00a0\nSiveillance Identity v1.6: All versions prior to v1.6.284.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nThe affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal message broker system, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to subscribe to arbitrary message queues.\nCVE-2021-44522 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nThe affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal activity feed database, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read, modify, or delete activity feed entries.\nCVE-2021-44523 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nThe affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\nCVE-2021-44524 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an update for Siveillance Identity and recommends users to update:\n\nSiveillance Identity v1.5: Update to Version 1.6.284.0 or later. Update to Version 1.5 SP4 and apply the Credential Path Tool.\nSiveilance Identity v1.6: Update to version 1.6.284.0 or later.\n\nSiemens has not identified any additional specific workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the general security recommendations below.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access of affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nPlease see Siemens security advisory SSA-463116 for more information.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
