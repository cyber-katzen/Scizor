EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.1\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: PHOENIX CONTACT\nEquipment: FL SWITCH 3xxx/4xxx/48xx Series\nVulnerabilities: Command Injection, Information Exposure, Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution and information disclosure.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll FL SWITCH 3xxx, 4xxx, and 48xxx Series products running firmware Version 1.0 to 1.32 are affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nAn attacker with permission to transfer configuration files to or from the switch or permission to upgrade firmware is able to execute arbitrary OS shell commands.\nCVE-2018-10730 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2 INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\nWeb interface CGI applications may copy the contents of the running configuration file to a commonly accessed file. Manipulation of a web login request can expose the contents of this file through to the web browser. A successful web interface login attempt is not required to read the configuration file contents.\nCVE-2018-10729 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nAn attacker may insert a carefully crafted cookie into a GET request to cause a buffer overflow that can initiate a denial of service attack and execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2018-10728 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nA remote attacker may exploit a \u201clong cookie\u201d related vulnerability to cause a buffer overflow that allows unauthorized access to the switches operating system files and the insertion of executable code into the OS.\nCVE-2018-10731 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCERT@VDE working with Vyacheslav Moskvin, Semen Sokolov, Evgeniy Druzhinin, Georgy Zaytsev and Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies and PHOENIX CONTACT reported the vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4.

Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
