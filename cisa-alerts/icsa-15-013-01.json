[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient iOS Application Authentication Vulnerabilities================================================================================ Last Revised August 29, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-013\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Siemens has identified authentication vulnerabilities in the SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rt\u00a0Client application. These vulnerabilities were reported directly to Siemens by Kim Schlyter, Seyton Bradford, and Richard Warren from FortConsult (NCC Group). Siemens has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rt\u00a0Client versions are affected:* SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient: All versions prior to V1\\.0\\.2* SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient Lite for iOS: All versions prior to V1\\.0\\.2\\.IMPACT------ An attacker with local access could use these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges on the application or the servers with which the application is communicating. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany. The SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient application, in combination with the SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtServer, allows remote mobile operation and observation of SIMATIC HMI systems. This software is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE\\-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, [http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522\\.html](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)  , web site last accessed January 13, 2015\\.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
