These vulnerabilities were reported directly to Siemens by Kim Schlyter, Seyton Bradford, and Richard Warren from FortConsult (NCC Group). Siemens has produced an update that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rt\u00a0Client versions are affected:\n\nSIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient: All versions prior to V1.0.2\nSIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient Lite for iOS: All versions prior to V1.0.2.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker with local access could use these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges on the application or the servers with which the application is communicating.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtClient application, in combination with the SIMATIC WinCC Sm@rtServer, allows remote mobile operation and observation of SIMATIC HMI systems. This software is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html, web site last accessed January 13, 2015.\n\nThe existing storage mechanism for the application specific password could allow attackers to extract the password and gain access to the application if local access is available.\nCVE-2014-5231NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5231, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

These updates are available on iTunes at:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/simatic-wincc-sm-rtclient/id871870286\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/de/app/simatic-wincc-sm-rtclient/id874209707\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-311299 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
