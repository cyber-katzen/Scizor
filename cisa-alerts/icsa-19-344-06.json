A CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING SUPPORT FOR INTEGRITY CHECK CWE-353\nAn attacker with network access to Port 102/TCP could modify the user program on the PLC in a way that the running code is different from the source code stored on the device.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-10943 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nEli Biham, Sara Bitan, Aviad Carmel, and Alon Dankner from Faculty of Computer Science, Technion Haifa; Uriel Malin and Avishai Wool from School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University; and Artem Zinenko from Kaspersky reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the following products and recommends users update to the new version.\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced: Update to v3.0\n\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family: Update to v4.4.0\n\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family: Update to v2.8.1\nSIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller: Update to v20.8\nSIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2: Update to v20.8\n\nSiemens is preparing further updates and recommends specific countermeasures until patches are available:\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nSIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family: Update to v4.4\n\n\nSIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family: Update to v2.8.1\nSIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2: Update to v20.8\nSIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller: Update to v20.8\n\n\nAll affected devices contain a feature called \u201cAccess Protection\u201d that prohibits unauthorized modifications of user code. Siemens recommends using access protection to protect affected devices from unauthorized modifications.\n\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n",
