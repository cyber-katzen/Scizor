[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryEuroTel ETL3100 Radio Transmitter================================= Release Date December 19, 2023 Alert Code ICSA\\-23\\-353\\-05**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available* **Vendor**  : EuroTel* **Equipment**  : ETL3100* **Vulnerabilities**  : Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, Authorization Bypass Through User\\-Controlled Key, Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain full access to the system, disclose sensitive information, or access hidden resources.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions EuroTel ETL3100 radio transmitter are affected:* ETL3100: version v01c01* ETL3100: version v01x37### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE\\-307](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)** EuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 does not limit the number of attempts to guess administrative credentials in remote password attacks to gain full control of the system.[CVE\\-2023\\-6928](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-6928)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER\\-CONTROLLED KEY CWE\\-639](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)** EuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 are vulnerable to insecure direct object references that occur when the application provides direct access to objects based on user\\-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability, attackers can bypass authorization, access the hidden resources on the system, and execute privileged functionalities.[CVE\\-2023\\-6929](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-6929)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)** EuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 suffer from an unauthenticated configuration and log download vulnerability. This enables the attacker to disclose sensitive information and assist in authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and full system access.[CVE\\-2023\\-6930](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-6930)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 9\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Communications* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Italy### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER CISA discovered a public proof of concept (PoC) as authored by Gjoko Krstic.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- EuroTel has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of affected versions of ETL3100 are invited to contact EuroTel [customer support](https://www.eurotel.it/contatti.php)  for additional information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
