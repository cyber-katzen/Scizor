EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: EuroTel\nEquipment: ETL3100\nVulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, Improper Access Control\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain full access to the system, disclose sensitive information, or access hidden resources.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions EuroTel ETL3100 radio transmitter are affected:\n\nETL3100: version v01c01\nETL3100: version v01x37\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nEuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 does not limit the number of attempts to guess administrative credentials in remote password attacks to gain full control of the system.\nCVE-2023-6928\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0AUTHORIZATION BYPASS THROUGH USER-CONTROLLED KEY CWE-639\nEuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 are vulnerable to insecure direct object references that occur when the application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability, attackers can bypass authorization, access the hidden resources on the system, and execute privileged functionalities.\nCVE-2023-6929\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nEuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 suffer from an unauthenticated configuration and log download vulnerability. This enables the attacker to disclose sensitive information and assist in authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and full system access.\nCVE-2023-6930\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Italy\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public proof of concept (PoC) as authored by Gjoko Krstic.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nEuroTel has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of affected versions of ETL3100 are invited to contact EuroTel\u00a0customer support\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
