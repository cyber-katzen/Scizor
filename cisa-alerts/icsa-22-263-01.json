EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.0*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable Remotely* **Vendor:**  Hitachi Energy* **Equipment:**  PROMOD IV* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Access Control2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files once the system is compromised.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of PROMOD IV and the PROMOD\\-Generator, an energy planning, transmission congestion, and price forecasting system, are affected:* Hitachi Energy PROMOD IV Version: 11\\.2, 11\\.3, and 11\\.4### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE\\-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) A vulnerability exists in the Actbar2\\.ocx module included in the affected products. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could remove data from the local system or modify the workflow, potentially impacting how the energy system interprets and responds to inputs.[CVE\\-2010\\-3591](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3591)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy is developing PROMOD IV version 11\\.5, which will contain a patch to resolve the vulnerability. Hitachi Energy urges users to implement the following mitigations:* Actbar2\\.ocx is no longer used by PROMOD IV. Users are encouraged to remove Actbar2\\.ocx. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network:* Physically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.* Separate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with the minimal number of ports open.* Process control systems should not be used for internet browsing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.* PROMOD IV should be deployed inside the enterprise\u2019s demilitarized zone (DMZ) network.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system* Users should follow the hardening guidelines published by T [he Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/)  to protect the host operating system.
