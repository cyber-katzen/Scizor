RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files once the system is compromised.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of PROMOD IV and the PROMOD-Generator, an energy planning, transmission congestion, and price forecasting system, are affected:\n\nHitachi Energy PROMOD IV Version: 11.2, 11.3, and 11.4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nA vulnerability exists in the Actbar2.ocx module included in the affected products. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could remove data from the local system or modify the workflow, potentially impacting how the energy system interprets and responds to inputs.\nCVE-2010-3591 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy is developing PROMOD IV version 11.5, which will contain a patch to resolve the vulnerability. Hitachi Energy urges users to implement the following mitigations:\u00a0\n\nActbar2.ocx is no longer used by PROMOD IV. Users are encouraged to remove Actbar2.ocx.\n\nHitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network:\u00a0\n\nPhysically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.\nSeparate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with the minimal number of ports open.\nProcess control systems should not be used for internet browsing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.\nPROMOD IV should be deployed inside the enterprise\u2019s demilitarized zone (DMZ) network.\nPortable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before connecting to a control system\nUsers should follow the hardening guidelines published by The Center for Internet Security (CIS) to protect the host operating system.\n\nFor more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000108.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics.
