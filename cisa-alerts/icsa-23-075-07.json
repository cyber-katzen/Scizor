EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Rockwell Automation\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0Modbus TCP Server Add-On Instruction (AOI)\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user to read the connected device\u2019s Modbus TCP Server AOI information.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rockwell Automation Modbus TCP Server AOI, are affected:\u00a0\n\nModbus TCP Server AOI: Versions 2.00 and 2.03\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\u00a0\nVersions of Rockwell Automation Modbus TCP Server AOI prior to 2.04.00 are vulnerable to an unauthorized user sending a malformed message that could cause the controller to respond with a copy of the most recent response to the last valid request. If exploited, an unauthorized user could read the connected device\u2019s Modbus TCP Server AOI information.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0027\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nResearchers at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute reported this vulnerability to Rockwell Automation.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation users of these affected products are encouraged to evaluate the following mitigations and apply them appropriately.\u00a0\nThis issue has been mitigated in the following AOI versions:\u00a02.04.00\u00a0and later.\u00a0\nRockwell Automation\u2019s general security guidelines can be found in the\u00a0Recommended Security Guidelines.\u00a0\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation\u2019s\u00a0security advisory.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
