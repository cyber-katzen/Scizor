EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Horner Automation\nEquipment: Cscape\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write, Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow local attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Cscape, a PLC control software, are affected:\n\nCscape Version 9.90 SP 6 and prior\nCscape Version 9.90 SP 7 and prior (CVE-2022-3379 and CVE-2022-3378 only)\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by writing outside the memory buffer.\nCVE-2022-3379 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nThe affected product does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.\nCVE-2022-3378 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nThe affected product does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.\nCVE-2022-3377 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHorner Automation recommends affected users update to the latest version of Cscape, version 9.90 SP8.\nFor further assistance, users should contact Horner Automation:\n\nFor North and South American users: techsppt@heapg.com (+1-317-916-4274)\nFor users outside of the Americas: technical.support@horner-apg.com (+353-(0)21-4321266 ext. 202)\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
