RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow local attackers to execute arbitrary code.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Cscape, a PLC control software, are affected:* Cscape Version 9\\.90 SP 6 and prior* Cscape Version 9\\.90 SP 7 and prior (CVE\\-2022\\-3379 and CVE\\-2022\\-3378 only)### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The affected product does not properly validate user\\-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by writing outside the memory buffer.[CVE\\-2022\\-3379](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3379)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE\\-824](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html) The affected product does not properly validate user\\-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out\\-of\\-bounds memory write.[CVE\\-2022\\-3378](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3378)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
