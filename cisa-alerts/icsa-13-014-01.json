Siemens has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to possible remote code execution or a denial of service.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAffected Products\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC RF Manager 2008, and\nSIMATIC RF Manager Basic v3.0 and lower (as distributed with RF670R and RF 640R).\n\nImpact\nThe RF Manager uses ActiveX and this component can also be accessed within Internet browsers. A user would have to visit a malicious Web site on the system in which RF Manager is installed to exploit the vulnerability. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could execute remote code and could cause a denial of service of the RF Manager. This could impact the setup of systems in the critical manufacturing, health and healthcare, power generation and distribution, food and beverage, and chemical industries.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nProducts in the Siemens SIMATIC RF Manager family manage connected radio frequency identification (RFID) readers to SIMATIC S7 controllers. This includes collecting supplied data, and compressing this data for enterprise systems, such as the Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) layer and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) layer. ERP and MES are widely used in industrial environments such as critical manufacturing, health and healthcare, power generation and distribution, food and beverage, and chemical industries worldwide.\nSiemens is a German-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nBuffer OverflowCWE-119: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, Web site last accessed January, 14, 2013.\nThe SIMATIC RF Manager uses an ActiveX component. This component is also shared with other programs, such as Internet browsers. If a user has installed the SIMATIC RF Manager\u2019s ActiveX applications on the system and visits a malicious Web site, code within the ActiveX components can be executed, causing a buffer overflow. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the browser context and possibly take control of the system.\nCVE-2013-0656 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Siemens has assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nExploiting this vulnerability could be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to visit a malicious Web site using the system containing the SIMATIC RF Manager. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMitigation\nSiemens has released a Siemens Security Advisoryd (SSA-099471: Buffer Overflow in SIMATIC RF Manager) that details this vulnerability and provides mitigations. Siemens has released a software patch that mitigates the vulnerability. Siemens requests that users contact Siemens\u2019 customer support to obtain the patch.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01A\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nPrevious Recommendations can be used as needed (otherwise, delete this text). List other products that are specific to the topic (i.e., phishing mitigations):\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click Web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
