EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.6*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Mitsubishi Electric* **Equipment:**  MELSEC iQ\\-R Series* **Vulnerability:**  Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition on a target product by sending specially crafted packets.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ\\-R Series products are affected:* RJ71EN71: Firmware version \u201c65\u201d and prior* R04/08/16/32/120ENCPU: Network part firmware version \u201c65\u201d and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)** MELSEC iQ\\-R Series RJ71EN71 products with firmware versions prior to \u201c65\u201d and R04/08/16/32/120ENCPU products with Network firmware versions prior to \u201c65\u201d are vulnerable to improper input validation. A remote unauthenticated user could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition on a target product by sending specially crafted packets. A system reset is required to recover from a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2022\\-40265](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-40265)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Japan### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Mitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric has fixed the vulnerability in the following MELSEC iQ\\-R Series products:* RJ71EN71: Update [firmware version to \u201c66\u201d or later](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/download/index.html)  .* R04/08/16/32/120ENCPU: Update [network part firmware version to \u201c66\u201d or later](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/download/index.html)  . Users should refer to the following product manual for instructions to update firmware:* [MELSEC iQ\\-R Module Configuration Manual](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/download/index.html)  \u201cFirmware Update Function.\u201d Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of an unauthenticated user exploiting this vulnerability:* Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when internet access is required.* Use the product within a local area network (LAN)* Block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.* Use the IP filter function to restrict the accessible IP addresses. Note: For using the IP filter function, users should see MELSEC iQ\\-R Ethernet User\u2019s Manual (Application) Security \u201cIP filter\u201d Users can refer to the [Mitsubishi Electric advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-017_en.pdf)  for further details. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
