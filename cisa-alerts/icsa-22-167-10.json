Successful exploitation requires OSPF to be enabled on an affected device and could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause network interruptions.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-37182](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-37182) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND\n\n\n* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** \n Multiple Sectors\n* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** \n Worldwide\n* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** \n Germany\n\n\n### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER\n\n\n\n Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n \n\n\n4\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n For all affected products, Siemens recommends updating to\n [v6\\.5 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/ view/109809635/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n \n\n\n* Disable OSPF in the layer 3 configuration menu (note OSPF is disabled by default). The vulnerability is not exploitable when OSPF is disabled.\n* If OSPF is used, set a password for the OSPF interface, and enable MD5 authentication.\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see Siemens Security Advisory\n [SSA\\-145224](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-145224.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
