RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to the server, alter information, create a denial\\-of\\-service condition, gain escalated privileges, and execute arbitrary code.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following version of Sewio\u2019s RTLS Studio, a Real\\-Time Location System (RTLS), is affected:\n \n\n\n* RTLS Studio: version 2\\.0\\.0 up to and including version 2\\.6\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [USE OF HARD\\-CODED PASSWORD CWE\\-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**\n\n\n\n\n Sewio\u2019s Real\\-Time Location System (RTLS) Studio version 2\\.0\\.0 up to and including version 2\\.6\\.2 contains hard\\-coded passwords for select users in the application\u2019s database. This could allow a remote attacker to login to the database with unrestricted access.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2022\\-45444](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-45444) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Sewio has provided the following updates and recommends that users update to the latest version:\n \n\n\n* RTLS Studio: Update to\n [version 3\\.0\\.0 or later](https://portal.sewio.net/login) \n (requires login) (Only for the following vulnerabilities: CVE\\-2022\\-47911, CVE\\-2022\\-43483, CVE\\-2022\\-45127, CVE\\-2022\\-47395, CVE\\-2022\\-47917, CVE\\-2022\\-46733, CVE\\-2022\\-43455\\)\n\n\n\n Sewio also recommends the following workarounds to reduce the risk of exploitation:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* For CVE\\-2022\\-45444: Manually change the database password.\n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n .
