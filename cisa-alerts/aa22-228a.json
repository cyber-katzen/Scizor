The actor can then steal ZCS email account credentials in cleartext form without any user interaction. With valid email account credentials in an organization not enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), a malicious actor can use spear phishing, social engineering, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks against the compromised organization. Additionally, malicious actors could use the valid account credentials to open webshells and maintain persistent access. On March 11, 2022, researchers from SonarSource announced the discovery of this ZCS vulnerability. Zimbra issued fixes for releases 8\\.8\\.15 and 9\\.0 on May 10, 2022\\. Based on evidence of active exploitation, CISA added this vulnerability to the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  on August 4, 2022\\. Due to ease of exploitation, CISA and the MS\\-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched ZCS instances in government and private networks.#### CVE\\-2022\\-27925 and CVE\\-2022\\-37042 CVE\\-2022\\-27925 is a high severity vulnerability in ZCS releases 8\\.8\\.15 and 9\\.0 that have mboximport functionality to receive a ZIP archive and extract files from it. An authenticated user has the ability to upload arbitrary files to the system thereby leading to directory traversal.\\[ [1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27925)  ] On August 10, 2022, researchers from Volexity reported widespread exploitation\u2014against over 1,000 ZCS instances\u2014of CVE\\-2022\\-27925 in conjunction with CVE\\-2022\\-37042\\.\\[ [2](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/08/10/mass-exploitation-of-unauthenticated-zimbra-rce-cve-2022-27925/)  ] CISA added both CVEs to the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  on August 11, 2022\\. CVE 2022 37042 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that affects ZCS releases 8\\.8\\.15 and 9\\.0\\. CVE 2022 37042 could allow an unauthenticated malicious actor access to a vulnerable ZCS instance. According to Zimbra, CVE 2022 37042 is found in the MailboxImportServlet function.\\[ [3]\\[](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37042) [4](https://blog.zimbra.com/2022/08/authentication-bypass-in-mailboximportservlet-vulnerability/)  ] Zimbra issued fixes in late July 2022\\.#### CVE\\-2022\\-30333 CVE\\-2022\\-30333 is a high\\-severity directory traversal vulnerability in RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and UNIX allowing a malicious actor to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation. A malicious actor can exploit CVE\\-2022\\-30333 against a ZCS server by sending an email with a malicious RAR file. Upon email receipt, the ZCS server would automatically extract the RAR file to check for spam or malware.\\[ [5](https://www.securityweek.com/unrar-vulnerability-exploited-wild-likely-against-zimbra-servers)  ] Any ZCS instance with unrar installed is vulnerable to CVE\\-2022\\-30333\\. Researchers from SonarSource shared details about this vulnerability in June 2022\\.\\[ [6](https://www.securityweek.com/unrar-vulnerability-exploited-wild-likely-against-zimbra-servers)  ] Zimbra made configuration changes to use the 7zip program instead of unrar.\\[ [7](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P25)  ] CISA added CVE\\-2022\\-3033 to the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  on August 9, 2022\\. Based on industry reporting, a malicious cyber actor is selling a cross\\-site scripting (XSS) exploit kit for the ZCS vulnerability to CVE 2022 30333\\. A Metasploit module is also available that creates a RAR file that can be emailed to a ZCS server to exploit CVE\\-2022\\-30333\\.\\[ [8](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167989/Zimbra-UnRAR-Path-Traversal.html)  ]#### CVE\\-2022\\-24682 CVE\\-2022\\-24682 is a medium\\-severity vulnerability that impacts ZCS webmail clients running releases before 8\\.8\\.15 patch 30 (update 1\\), which contain a cross\\-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowing malicious actors to steal session cookie files. Researchers from Volexity shared this vulnerability on February 3, 2022\\[ [9](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/02/03/operation-emailthief-active-exploitation-of-zero-day-xss-vulnerability-in-zimbra/)  ], and Zimbra issued a fix on February 4, 2022\\.\\[ [10](https://blog.zimbra.com/2022/02/hotfix-available-5-feb-for-zero-day-exploit-vulnerability-in-zimbra-8-8-15/)  ] CISA added this vulnerability to the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  on February 25, 2022\\. DETECTION METHODS Note: CISA and the MS\\-ISAC will update this section with additional IOCs and signatures as further information becomes available. CISA recommends administrators, especially at organizations that did not immediately update their ZCS instances upon patch release, to hunt for malicious activity using the following third\\-party detection signatures:* ***Updated September 27*** , ***2022*** : Hunt for IOCs including:| IP Addresses | Note || --- | --- || 62\\.113\\.255\\[.]70 | New September 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during August 15\\-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE\\-2022\\-27925 and CVE\\-2022\\-37042 || 185\\.112\\.83\\[.]77 | New September 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during August 15\\-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE\\-2022\\-27925 and CVE\\-2022\\-37042 || 207\\.148\\.76\\[.]235 | A Cobalt Strike command and control (C2\\) domain || 209\\.141\\.56\\[.]190 | New September 27, 2022 |* ***Updated August 23*** , ***2022*** : Deploy Snort signatures to detect malicious activity: alert tcp any any \\-\\> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: HTTP POST content data '.jsp' file'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to\\_server; content:\"POST\"; http\\_method; content:\"\\|2f\\|service\\|2f\\|extension\\|2f\\|backup\\|2f\\|mboximport\"; nocase; http\\_uri; content:\"file\\|3a\\|\"; nocase; http\\_client\\_body; content:\"\\|2e\\|jsp\"; http\\_client\\_body; fast\\_pattern; classtype:http\\-content; reference:cve,2022\\-30333;) alert tcp any any \\-\\> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: Client HTTP Header 'QIHU 360SE'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to\\_server; content:\"POST\"; http\\_method; content:\"\\|2f\\|service\\|2f\\|extension\\|2f\\|backup\\|2f\\|mboximport\"; nocase; http\\_uri; content:\"QIHU\\|20\\|360SE\"; nocase; http\\_header; fast\\_pattern; classtype:http\\-header; reference:cve,2022\\-30333;) alert tcp any any \\-\\> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA:HTTP GET URI for Zimbra Local Config\"; sid:x; flow:established,to\\_server; content:\"/public/jsp/runas.jsp?pwd\\=zim\\&i\\=/opt/zimbra/bin/zmlocalconfig\\|3a\\|\\-s\"; http\\_uri; classtype:http\\-uri; reference:cve,2022\\-30333;)* Deploy third\\-party YARA rules to detect malicious activity:\t+ See\t [Volexity\u2019s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE\\-2022\\-27925](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/08/10/mass-exploitation-of-unauthenticated-zimbra-rce-cve-2022-27925/)### Mitigations CISA and the MS\\-ISAC recommend organizations upgrade to the latest ZCS releases as noted on [Zimbra Security \u2013 News \\& Alerts](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center)  and [Zimbra Security Advisories](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories)  . See [Volexity\u2019s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE\\-2022\\-27925](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/08/10/mass-exploitation-of-unauthenticated-zimbra-rce-cve-2022-27925/)  for mitigation steps. Additionally, CISA and the MS\\-ISAC recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk of compromise:* **Maintain and test**  an incident response plan.* **Ensure your organization has a vulnerability management program**  in place and that it prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  . **Note:**  CISA\u2019s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations: [cisa.gov/cyber\\-hygiene\\-services](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)  .* **Properly configure and secure**  internet\\-facing network devices.\t+ Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.\t+ Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.\t+ Disable/remove unused network services and devices.* **Adopt [zero\\-trust principles and architecture](https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2021/09/07/no-trust-no-problem-maturing-towards-zero-trust-architectures)** , including:\t+ Micro\\-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.\t+ Enforcing phishing\\-resistant (MFA) for all users and virtual private network (VPN) connections.\t+ Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.### INCIDENT RESPONSE If an organization\u2019s system has been compromised by active or recently active threat actors in their environment, CISA and the MS\\-ISAC recommend the following initial steps:1. **Collect and review artifacts**  , such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.2. **Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts**  .3. **Reimage compromised hosts**  .4. **Provision new account credentials**  .5. **Report the compromise**  to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center ( [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov)  or 888\\-282\\-0870\\). SLTT government entities can also report to the MS\\-ISAC ( [SOC@cisecurity.org](mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org)  or 866\\-787\\-4722\\). See the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on [Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a)  for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA and the MS\\-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see CISA\u2019s [Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf)  .
