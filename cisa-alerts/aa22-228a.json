CVEs currently being exploited against ZCS include:\n\nCVE-2022-24682\nCVE-2022-27924\nCVE-2022-27925 chained with CVE-2022-37042\nCVE-2022-30333\n\nCyber threat actors may be targeting unpatched ZCS instances in both government and private sector networks. CISA and the MS-ISAC strongly urge users and administrators to apply the guidance in the Recommendations section of this CSA to help secure their organization\u2019s systems against malicious cyber activity. CISA and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations who did not immediately update their ZCS instances upon patch release, or whose ZCS instances were exposed to the internet, to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the third-party detection signatures in the Detection Methods section of this CSA. Organizations that detect potential compromise should apply the steps in the Incident Response section of this CSA.\nUpdated November 10, 2022:\nThis CSA has been updated with additional IOCs. For a downloadable copy of the IOCs, see the following Malware Analysis Reports (MARs):\n\nMAR-10400779-1\nMAR-10400779-2\nMAR-10401765-1\nMAR-10398871-1\nNew, November 10, 2022: MAR-10410305-1.v1 JSP Webshell\n\nUpdate End\nDownload the PDF version of this report: pdf, 480 kb\nDownload the IOCs: .stix 12.2 kb\n\nTechnical Details\n\nCVE-2022-27924\nCVE-2022-27924 is a high-severity vulnerability enabling an unauthenticated malicious actor to inject arbitrary memcache commands into a targeted ZCS instance and cause an overwrite of arbitrary cached entries. The actor can then steal ZCS email account credentials in cleartext form without any user interaction. With valid email account credentials in an organization not enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), a malicious actor can use spear phishing, social engineering, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks against the compromised organization. Additionally, malicious actors could use the valid account credentials to open webshells and maintain persistent access.\nOn March 11, 2022, researchers from SonarSource announced the discovery of this ZCS vulnerability. Zimbra issued fixes for releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 on May 10, 2022. Based on evidence of active exploitation, CISA added this vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 4, 2022. Due to ease of exploitation, CISA and the MS-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched ZCS instances in government and private networks.\nCVE-2022-27925 and CVE-2022-37042\nCVE-2022-27925 is a high severity vulnerability in ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 that have mboximport functionality to receive a ZIP archive and extract files from it. An authenticated user has the ability to upload arbitrary files to the system thereby leading to directory traversal.[1] On August 10, 2022, researchers from Volexity reported widespread exploitation\u2014against over 1,000 ZCS instances\u2014of CVE-2022-27925 in conjunction with CVE-2022-37042.[2] CISA added both CVEs to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 11, 2022.\nCVE 2022 37042 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that affects ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0. CVE 2022 37042 could allow an unauthenticated malicious actor access to a vulnerable ZCS instance. According to Zimbra, CVE 2022 37042 is found in the MailboxImportServlet function.[3][4] Zimbra issued fixes in late July 2022.\nCVE-2022-30333\nCVE-2022-30333 is a high-severity directory traversal vulnerability in RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and UNIX allowing a malicious actor to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation. A malicious actor can exploit CVE-2022-30333 against a ZCS server by sending an email with a malicious RAR file. Upon email receipt, the ZCS server would automatically extract the RAR file to check for spam or malware.[5] Any ZCS instance with unrar installed is vulnerable to CVE-2022-30333.\nResearchers from SonarSource shared details about this vulnerability in June 2022.[6] Zimbra made configuration changes to use the 7zip program instead of unrar.[7] CISA added CVE-2022-3033 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 9, 2022. Based on industry reporting, a malicious cyber actor is selling a cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit kit for the ZCS vulnerability to CVE 2022 30333. A Metasploit module is also available that creates a RAR file that can be emailed to a ZCS server to exploit CVE-2022-30333.[8]\nCVE-2022-24682\nCVE-2022-24682 is a medium-severity vulnerability that impacts ZCS webmail clients running releases before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), which contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowing malicious actors to steal session cookie files. Researchers from Volexity shared this vulnerability on February 3, 2022[9], and Zimbra issued a fix on February 4, 2022.[10] CISA added this vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on February 25, 2022.\nDETECTION METHODS\nNote: CISA and the MS-ISAC will update this section with additional IOCs and signatures as further information becomes available.\nCISA recommends administrators, especially at organizations that did not immediately update their ZCS instances upon patch release, to hunt for malicious activity using the following third-party detection signatures:\n\nUpdated September 27, 2022: Hunt for IOCs including:\n\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n62.113.255[.]70\n\n\nNew September 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during August 15-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE-2022-27925 and CVE-2022-37042 \n\n\n\n\n185.112.83[.]77\n\n\nNew September 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during August 15-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE-2022-27925 and CVE-2022-37042\n\n\n\n\n207.148.76[.]235\n\n\nA Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) domain\n\n\n\n\n209.141.56[.]190\n\n\nNew September 27, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Updated August 23, 2022: Deploy Snort signatures to detect malicious activity:\n\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: HTTP POST content data '.jsp' file'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server; content:\"POST\"; http_method; content:\"|2f|service|2f|extension|2f|backup|2f|mboximport\"; nocase; http_uri; content:\"file|3a|\"; nocase; http_client_body; content:\"|2e|jsp\"; http_client_body; fast_pattern; classtype:http-content; reference:cve,2022-30333;)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: Client HTTP Header 'QIHU 360SE'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server; content:\"POST\"; http_method; content:\"|2f|service|2f|extension|2f|backup|2f|mboximport\"; nocase; http_uri; content:\"QIHU|20|360SE\"; nocase; http_header; fast_pattern; classtype:http-header; reference:cve,2022-30333;)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA:HTTP GET URI for Zimbra Local Config\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server; content:\"/public/jsp/runas.jsp?pwd=zim&i=/opt/zimbra/bin/zmlocalconfig|3a|-s\"; http_uri; classtype:http-uri; reference:cve,2022-30333;) \n\nDeploy third-party YARA rules to detect malicious activity:\n\nSee Volexity\u2019s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE-2022-27925\n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA and the MS-ISAC recommend organizations upgrade to the latest ZCS releases as noted on Zimbra Security \u2013 News & Alerts and Zimbra Security Advisories.\nSee Volexity\u2019s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE-2022-27925 for mitigation steps.\nAdditionally, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk of compromise:\n\nMaintain and test an incident response plan.\nEnsure your organization has a vulnerability management program in place and that it prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of known exploited vulnerabilities. Note: CISA\u2019s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations: cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services.\u00a0\nProperly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.\n\nDo not expose management interfaces to the internet.\nDisable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.\nDisable/remove unused network services and devices.\n\n\nAdopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:\n\nMicro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.\nEnforcing phishing-resistant (MFA) for all users and virtual private network (VPN) connections.\nRestricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE\nIf an organization\u2019s system has been compromised by active or recently active threat actors in their environment, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend the following initial steps:\n\nCollect and review artifacts, such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.\nQuarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.\nReimage compromised hosts.\nProvision new account credentials.\nReport the compromise to CISA via CISA\u2019s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or 888-282-0870). SLTT government entities can also report to the MS-ISAC (SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722).\n\nSee the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA and the MS-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see CISA\u2019s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although tailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide detailed operational procedures for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCISA and the MS-ISAC would like to thank Volexity and Secureworks for their contributions to this advisory.\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
