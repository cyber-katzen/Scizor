EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3\u00a09.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/Low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Voltronic Power\nEquipment:\u00a0ViewPower Pro\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Exposed Dangerous Method or Function, OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition, obtain administrator credentials, or achieve remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ViewPower Pro, an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) management software, are affected:\n\nViewPower Pro: 2.0-22165\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nThe affected product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying the resulting data will be valid.\nCVE-2023-51570\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nWhen a specific service of the affected product receives a certain message from an unauthenticated user, that process may stop.\nCVE-2023-51571\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an OS command injection, which may allow remote code execution on the underlying operating system.\nCVE-2023-51572\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0EXPOSED DANGEROUS METHOD OR FUNCTION CWE-749\nThe affected product allows an unauthenticated user to invoke a method that may modify the administrator account password.\nCVE-2023-51573\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSimon Janz (@esj4y) of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nVoltronic Power did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of Voltronic Power products are encouraged to contact Voltronic Power and keep their systems up to date.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
