EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable from adjacent network/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC, OpenPCS\nVulnerabilities: NULL Pointer Dereference\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause a persistent denial-of-service condition in the RPC Server of these products.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nOpenPCS 7 V9.1: All versions\nSIMATIC BATCH V9.1: All versions\nSIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1: All versions\nSIMATIC Route Control V9.1: All versions\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V18: All versions\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional V19: All versions\nSIMATIC WinCC V7.4: All versions\nSIMATIC WinCC V7.5: All versions prior to V7.5 SP2 Update 15\nSIMATIC WinCC V8.0: All versions prior V8.0 SP4\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe implementation of the RPC (Remote Procedure call) communication protocol in the affected products do not properly handle certain unorganized RPC messages. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the RPC server.\nCVE-2023-48363\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2023-48363. A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nThe implementation of the RPC (Remote Procedure call) communication protocol in the affected products do not properly handle certain malformed RPC messages. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the RPC server.\nCVE-2023-48364\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2023-48364. A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens ProductCERT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSIMATIC WinCC V7.5: Update to V7.5 SP2 Update 15 or\u00a0later version\nSIMATIC WinCC V8.0: Update to V8.0 SP4 or\u00a0later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-753746 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
