MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n \n\n\n* SIMATIC WinCC V7\\.5: Update to V7\\.5 SP2 Update 15 or\n [later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109793460/)\n* SIMATIC WinCC V8\\.0: Update to V8\\.0 SP4 or\n [later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109818723/)\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) \n and following recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\n [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-753746 in\n [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-753746.html) \n and\n [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-753746.json) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\n [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\n [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n \n\n\n5\\.
