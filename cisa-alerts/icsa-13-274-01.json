Researcher Eireann Leverett of IOActive coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability with Siemens. This issue only applies to switches using older firmware versions and has been fixed from firmware V4.5.0 (non-IRT) and V5.1.0 (IRT) on. Siemens has reported the resolution to ICS-CERT.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:\n\nSCALANCE X-200 switch family with firmware version prior to V4.5.0.\nSCALANCE X-200IRT (Isochronous Real-Time) switch family with firmware version prior to V5.1.0.\n\nAlternatively, the affected products may be identified by using their Machine-Readable Product Designation (MLFB). Products with the following MLFBs may be affected:\n\nSCALANCE X-200 MLFBs:\n\n6GK5224-0BA00-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5216-0BA00-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5212-2BB00-2AA3\n6GK5212-2BC00-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5208-0BA10-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5206-1BB10-2AA3\n6GK5206-1BC10-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-2BB10-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-2BC10-2AA3\n6GK5208-0HA10-2AA6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-0BA00-2AF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5208-0BA00-2AF2\n6GK5206-1BC00-2AF2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-2BC00-2AF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-2BB10-2CA2\n\nSCALANCE X-200IRT MLFBs:\n\n6GK5201-3JR00-2BA6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-0BA00-2BF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-0JA00-2BA6\n6GK5202-2JR00-2BA6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5202-2BH00-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5201-3BH00-2BA3\n6GK5200-4AH00-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5202-2BB00-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204-0BA00-2BA3\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow attackers to perform administrative operations over the network without authentication.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors.\nThe affected products, SCALANCE X-200 switches, are used to connect industrial components such as PLCs or HMIs. These switches use a Web-based interface that enables administrators to change device configuration using an Internet browser.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html, Web site last accessed October 03, 2013.\n\nThe integrated Web server of SCALANCE X-200 switches might allow attackers to perform administrative operations over the network without authentication.\nCVE-2013-5944NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-5944, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, Web site last visited October 03, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens recommends upgrading to the current SCALANCE X-200 firmware versions V5.0.1 (non-IRT) and V5.1.2 (IRT). These versions are not vulnerable to the authentication bypass issue.\nThe firmware update for SCALANCE X-200 can be obtained here:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/78458674\nThe firmware update for SCALANCE X-200IRT can be obtained here:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/78454417\nSiemens security advisory is located here:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/innovation/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-176087.pdf\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed October 03, 2013. ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed October 03, 2013. that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
