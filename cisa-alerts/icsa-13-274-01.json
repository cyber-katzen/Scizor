Siemens has identified an authentication bypass vulnerability in the SCALANCE X\\-200 switch product family. Researcher Eireann Leverett of IOActive coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability with Siemens. This issue only applies to switches using older firmware versions and has been fixed from firmware V4\\.5\\.0 (non\\-IRT) and V5\\.1\\.0 (IRT) on. Siemens has reported the resolution to ICS\\-CERT. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:* SCALANCE X\\-200 switch family with firmware version prior to V4\\.5\\.0\\.* SCALANCE X\\-200IRT (Isochronous Real\\-Time) switch family with firmware version prior to V5\\.1\\.0\\. Alternatively, the affected products may be identified by using their Machine\\-Readable Product Designation (MLFB). Products with the following MLFBs may be affected:* SCALANCE X\\-200 MLFBs: 6GK5224\\-0BA00\\-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5216\\-0BA00\\-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5212\\-2BB00\\-2AA3 6GK5212\\-2BC00\\-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5208\\-0BA10\\-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5206\\-1BB10\\-2AA3 6GK5206\\-1BC10\\-2AA3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-2BB10\\-2AA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-2BC10\\-2AA3 6GK5208\\-0HA10\\-2AA6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-0BA00\\-2AF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5208\\-0BA00\\-2AF2 6GK5206\\-1BC00\\-2AF2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-2BC00\\-2AF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-2BB10\\-2CA2* SCALANCE X\\-200IRT MLFBs: 6GK5201\\-3JR00\\-2BA6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-0BA00\\-2BF2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-0JA00\\-2BA6 6GK5202\\-2JR00\\-2BA6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5202\\-2BH00\\-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5201\\-3BH00\\-2BA3 6GK5200\\-4AH00\\-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5202\\-2BB00\\-2BA3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6GK5204\\-0BA00\\-2BA3IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow attackers to perform administrative operations over the network without authentication. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors. The affected products, SCALANCE X\\-200 switches, are used to connect industrial components such as PLCs or HMIs. These switches use a Web\\-based interface that enables administrators to change device configuration using an Internet browser.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### AUTHENTICATION BYPASS ISSUESCWE\\-592: Authentication Bypass Issues, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592\\.html, Web site last accessed October 03, 2013\\.

Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices, Web site last accessed October 03, 2013\\.
