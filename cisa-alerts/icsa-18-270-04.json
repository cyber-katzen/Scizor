EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 4.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: Delta Industrial Automation PMSoft\nVulnerability: Out-of-Bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read confidential information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Delta Industrial Automation PMSoft, a software development tool for motion controllers, are affected:\n\nDelta Industrial Automation PMSoft v2.11 or prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability can be executed when processing project files, which may allow an attacker to read confidential information.\nCVE-2018-14824 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMat Powell of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends affected users update to at least PMSoft v2.12, which was made available as of September 18, 2018, or the latest available version. This update can be found for download at the following location:\nhttp://www.deltaww.com/services/DownloadCenter2.aspx?secID=8&pid=2&tid=0&CID=06&itemID=060301&typeID=1&downloadID=,&title=--%20Select%20Product%20Series%20--&dataType=8;&check=1&hl=en-US\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
