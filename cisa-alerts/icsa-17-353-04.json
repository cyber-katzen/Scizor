Soft Comfort========================== Last Revised December 19, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-353\\-04### **CVSS v3 5\\.9****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable.**Vendor:**  Siemens**Equipment:**  LOGO! Soft Comfort**Vulnerability:**  Download of Code without Integrity CheckAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following LOGO! Soft Comfort engineering software products:* LOGO! Soft Comfort: All versions prior to V8\\.2IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker in a privileged network position to manipulate a software package during download.MITIGATION---------- Siemens removed the Update Center from LOGO! Soft Comfort V8\\.2 and provides SHA\\-256 checksums for all LOGO! Soft Comfort software packages via a secured HTTPS channel. Siemens recommends verifying legitimacy by comparing the SHA\\-256 checksum of the downloaded software package with the SHA\\-256 checksum provided for the software package.\u00a0 Software version 8\\.2 for LOGO! Soft Comfort and SHA\\-256 checksums for LOGO! Soft Comfort downloads can be obtained via:[https://www.siemens.com/logo\\-update](https://www.siemens.com/logo-update)  As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises configuring the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.[https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-888929 at the following location:[http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert\\-security\\-advisories.htm](http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.2. Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.3. Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[DOWNLOAD OF CODE WITHOUT INTEGRITY CHECK CWE\\-494](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The update center of LOGO! Soft Comfort lacks integrity verification on software packages downloaded via an unprotected communication channel. This could allow a remote attacker to manipulate the software package while performing a man\\-in\\-the\\-middle (MitM) attack.[CVE\\-2017\\-12740](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12740)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).RESEARCHER---------- Tobias Gebhardt reported this vulnerability to Siemens.BACKGROUND----------**Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Commercial Facilities, Transportation Systems**Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide**Company Headquarters Location:**  Germany This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.Vendor------* Siemens-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-17-353-04)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01) Jul 18, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02) Jul 16, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01) Jul 11, 2024 ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
