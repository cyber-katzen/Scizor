EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: DIAEnergie\nVulnerabilities: SQL Injection, Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated attacker with limited privileges to escalate privileges, retrieve confidential information, upload arbitrary files, backdoor the application, and compromise the system on which DIAEnergie is deployed.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Delta Electronics DIAEnergie, an industrial energy management system, are affected:\n\nDIAEnergie: Versions v1.10.00.005\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CWE-89\nDelta Electronics DIAEnergie is vulnerable to an SQL injection vulnerability that exists in the script Handler_CFG.ashx. An authenticated attacker can exploit this issue to potentially compromise the system on which DIAEnergie is deployed.\nCVE-2024-34031 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-34031. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CWE-89\nDelta Electronics DIAEnergie is vulnerable to an SQL injection vulnerability that exists in the GetDIACloudList endpoint. An authenticated attacker can exploit this issue to potentially compromise the system on which DIAEnergie is deployed.\nCVE-2024-34032 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-34032. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE-22\nDelta Electronics DIAEnergie has insufficient input validation which makes it possible to perform a path traversal attack and write outside of the intended directory. If a file name is specified that already exists on the file system, then the original file will be overwritten.\nCVE-2024-34033 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-34033. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Electronics recommends users update to DIAEnergie v1.10.01.004 to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users can request this version of DIAEnergie from Delta Electronics' regional sales or agents.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
