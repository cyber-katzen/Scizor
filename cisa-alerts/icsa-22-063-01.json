PLC4TRUCKS)\nVulnerabilities: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Improper Protection against Electromagnetic Fault Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a nearby attacker to execute diagnostic functions in the trailer or light the trailer ABS fault telltale in a tractor. Please visit NMFTA\u00a0for more details.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nPower Line Communications (PLC): J2497 (a.k.a. PLC4TRUCKS), a bidirectional, serial communications link over the vehicle power supply line, is affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING AUTHENTICATION FOR CRITICAL FUNCTION CWE-306\nTrailer brake controllers implement diagnostic functions which can be invoked by replaying J2497 messages. There is no authentication or authorization for these functions.\nCVE-2022-25922 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC FAULT INJECTION CWE-1319\nTrailer power line communications J2497 (PLC4TRUCKS) receivers are susceptible to remote RF induced signals.\nCVE-2022-26131 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Transportation Systems Sector\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States, Canada, Mexico\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNational Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. (NMFTA) researcher Ben Gardiner, NMFTA motor freight carrier members, and Assured Information Security researchers Chris Poore, Dan Salloum, and Eric Thayer reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe vulnerable technology, J2497, has been fielded since 2001 and the service lifetime of trailers is 15 to 30 years. For new equipment, the industry should consider dropping all J2497 features except for backwards-compatibility with LAMP ON detection only. For trailer equipment this means migrating all diagnostics to whatever newer trailer buses are established as the norm. For tractor equipment this means removing support for reception of any J2497 message other than LAMP messages and protecting the backwards-compatible trailers from attack.\u00a0\nNMFTA has published detailed information about how to mitigate these issues in the following ways:\n\nInstall a LAMP ON firewall for each ECU\nUse a LAMP detect circuit LAMP ON sender with each trailer\nChange addresses dynamically on each tractor in response to detecting a transmitter on its current address.\u00a0\nInstall RF chokes on each trailer between chassis ground and wiring ground\nLoad with LAMP keyhole signal on each tractor\nFlood with jamming signal on each tractor\n\nPlease visit\u00a0NMFTA for additional details on these and other solutions.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
