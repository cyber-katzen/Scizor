The researcher Eran Goldstein, in collaboration with Check Point Software Technologies and CRITIFENCE, released vulnerability information after coordination with the vendor and ICS-CERT.\n--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 2 --------\nSchneider Electric has released a new software version that removes the vulnerable web-server component.\n--------- End Update B Part 1 of 2 ----------\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nDetailed vulnerability information is publicly available that could be used to develop an exploit that targets these vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of Magelis HMI:\n\nMagelis GTO Advanced Optimum Panels, all versions,\nMagelis GTU Universal Panel, all versions,\nMagelis STO5xx and STU Small panels, all versions,\nMagelis XBT GH Advanced Hand-held Panels, all versions,\nMagelis XBT GK Advanced Touchscreen Panels with Keyboard, all versions,\nMagelis XBT GT Advanced Touchscreen Panels, all versions, and\nMagelis XBT GTW Advanced Open Touchscreen Panels (Windows XPe).\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a denial of service for the affected devices.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected products, Magelis, are human-machine interfaces. According to Schneider Electric, the Magelis HMIs are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, and Food and Agriculture. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTIONCWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, web site last accessed November 3, 2016.\n\nAn attacker can open multiple connections to a targeted web server and keep connections open preventing new connections from being made, rendering the web server unavailable during an attack.\nCVE-2016-8367NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8367, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. Schneider Electric\u2019s CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L, web site last accessed November 3, 2016.\n\nUNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTIONCWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, web site last accessed November 3, 2016.\n\nAn attacker may be able to disrupt a targeted web server, resulting in a denial of service.\nProduct versions prior to Version 6.2 Service Pack 2 require the user to reboot the affected device in order to regain operation.\nCVE-2016-8374NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8374, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. Schneider Electric\u2019s CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, web site last accessed November 3, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nDetailed vulnerability information is publicly available that could be used to develop an exploit that targets these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\n--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 --------\nSchneider Electric has released a new version of Vijeo XD, Version 2.4.2, which does not integrate the web server feature containing the identified vulnerabilities.\nSchneider Electric\u2019s Vijeo XD, Version 2.4.2, is available at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/range/62621-Vijeo%20XD/?docTypeGroup=3541958-Software%2FFirmware\nSchneider Electric states that users who need the web server feature should instead apply the following measures to minimize potential exposure:\n--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ----------\n\nSchneider Electric advises users with products having Runtime versions prior to Version 6.2 Service Pack 2 to upgrade to the latest available version. Current versions of the Runtime do not require a reboot for the HMI to recover from attack.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nMinimize potential attack surface by leaving the Web Gate Server set to its default disabled state if it is not needed.\nPlace control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nLimit traffic on the local network with managed switches.\n\n\nWhere possible, avoid Wi-Fi capabilities; but when Wi-Fi is essential, use only secure communications (such as WPA2 encryption).\nDo not grant access to unknown computers.\nWhen remote access is essential, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs); and ensure the remote access solution(s), as well as the remote computer(s), are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\nFor further information on vulnerabilities or interim mitigations, please see Schneider Electric\u2019s Security Notification - Magelis HMI, at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2016-302-01/\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
