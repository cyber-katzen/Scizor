GE has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following GE product is affected:\n\nProficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY, Version 8.2 and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nIf this vulnerability is exploited, it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a system running the affected software.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nGE is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.\nThe affected product, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY, is a Client/Server-based human-machine interface/supervisory control and data acquisition (HMI/SCADA) application. According to GE, Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY is deployed across multiple industries.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, web site last accessed January 15, 2015.\n\nA vulnerability exists in CIMPLICITY CimView and CIMPLICITY CimEdit components in the way they process information stored in the CIMPLICITY screen (.CIM) files. A specially crafted .CIM file could potentially lead to a memory access violation and arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2014-2355NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2355, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 6.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 15, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULITY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nGE recommends that asset owners apply product updates to Proficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY Versions 8.1 and 8.2. The following product updates address the memory access violation vulnerability:\nProficy HMI/SCADA \u2013 CIMPLICITY 8.1 SIM 29 (DN4219) available at:\nhttp://support.ge-ip.com/support/index?page=dwchannel&id=DN4219\nProficy HMI/SCADA\u2013CIMPLICITY 8.2 SIM 26 (DN4197) available at:\nhttp://support.ge-ip.com/support/index?page=dwchannel&id=DN4197\nIn cases where upgrading is not feasible, GE advises asset owners using CIMPLICITY versions prior to 8.1 to consider using the following recommendations that may mitigate or eliminate the impact of the vulnerability:\n\nTake steps to properly secure and protect stored CIMPLICITY screen files (.CIM).\nAvoid using .CIM files received from unknown sources.\nAvoid sending unprotected .CIM files over unencrypted networks or public Internet.\nConsider using a strong hashing algorithm to validate integrity of created .CIM files and ensure they have not been tampered with over time.\n\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (www.ics-cert.org).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, web site last accessed January 15, 2015. for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed January 15, 2015. for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n",
