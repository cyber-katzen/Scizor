For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.9\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0SIMATIC industrial products\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following software from Siemens is affected:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC Field PG M5: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC Field PG M6: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC BX-39A: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC427E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC477E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC477E Pro: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC627E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC647E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC677E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC IPC847E: All versions\u00a0\nSIMATIC ITP1000: All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0TIME-OF-CHECK TIME-OF-USE (TOCTOU) RACE CONDITION CWE-367\u00a0\nSiemens SIMATIC industrial products versions listed above contain a time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel processors, which could allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-21198\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple Sectors\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nAs a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems. Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code.\u00a0\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens'\u00a0operational guidelines\u00a0for industrial security and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Siemens industrial security can be found on the\u00a0Siemens Industrial Security webpage.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, users should contact the\u00a0Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-686975 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\u00a0\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
