Please see the OSIsoft alerts referenced in the Mitigation section.\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow escalated privileges and may allow remote code execution.\nMITIGATION\nOSIsoft recommends that users upgrade to PI Vision 2017 R2 Update 1 or PI AF Services 2017 R2 Update 1, which both address the PI Web API vulnerabilities. OBtain the updates from OSIsoft.\nOSIsoft has released the following alerts:\nhttps://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00337\nhttps://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00336\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nPERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264\n\nPrivileges may be escalated, giving attackers access to the PI System via the service account.\nCVE-2018-7500 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\n\nCross-site scripting may occur when input is incorrectly neutralized.\nCVE-2018-7508 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nOSIsoft self-reported the vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Multiple Sectors\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: United States\n",
