Please see the OSIsoft alerts referenced in the Mitigation section.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow escalated privileges and may allow remote code execution.MITIGATION---------- OSIsoft recommends that users upgrade to PI Vision 2017 R2 Update 1 or PI AF Services 2017 R2 Update 1, which both address the PI Web API vulnerabilities. OBtain the updates from OSIsoft. OSIsoft has released the following alerts:<https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00337><https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00336> NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE\\-264](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Privileges may be escalated, giving attackers access to the PI System via the service account.[CVE\\-2018\\-7500](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7500)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
