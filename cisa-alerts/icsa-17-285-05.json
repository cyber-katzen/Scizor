EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: BACnet Field Panels\nVulnerabilities: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, Path Traversal\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-17-285-05 Siemens BACnet Field Panels that was published October 12, 2017, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers with access to the integrated webserver to download sensitive information.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following BACnet field panels:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 3 ---------\n\nAPOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet): All versions prior to v3.5\nAPOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet): All versions\nAPOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet): All versions prior to v3.5\u00a0\nAPOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet): All versions\nTALON TC Compact (BACnet): All versions prior to v3.5\nTALON TC Modular (BACnet): All versions prior to v3.5\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 3 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\nAn attacker with network access to the integrated web server (Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) could bypass the authentication and download sensitive information from the device.\nCVE-2017-9946 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\nA directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker with network access to the integrated web server (Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) to obtain information on the structure of the file system of the affected devices.\nCVE-2017-9947 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 ---------\nRoseSecurity reported the vulnerabilities for APOGEE PXC Series (P2 Ethernet) devices to Siemens.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 3 ---------\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\nSiemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.\n\nAPOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet): Update to v3.5 or later version\nAPOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet): Disable the integrated webserver\nAPOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet): Update to v3.5 or later version\nAPOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet): Disable the integrated webserver\nTALON TC Compact (BACnet): Update to v3.5 or later version\nTALON TC Modular (BACnet): Update to v3.5 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nSiemens recommends disabling the integrated webserver when not in use\nPlease contact a Siemens office for additional support\n\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-148078\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
