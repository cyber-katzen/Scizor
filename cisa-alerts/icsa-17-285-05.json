A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [PATH TRAVERSAL CWE\\-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) A directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker with network access to the integrated web server (Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) to obtain information on the structure of the file system of the affected devices.[CVE\\-2017\\-9947](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9947)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial facilities* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  RoseSecurity reported the vulnerabilities for APOGEE PXC Series (P2 Ethernet) devices to Siemens.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** 5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends updating to the latest versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.* APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5](https://partnerportal.extranet.dc.siemens.com/)  or later version* APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet): Disable the integrated webserver* APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5](https://partnerportal.extranet.dc.siemens.com/)  or later version* APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet): Disable the integrated webserver* TALON TC Compact (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5](https://partnerportal.extranet.dc.siemens.com/)  or later version* TALON TC Modular (BACnet): [Update to v3\\.5](https://partnerportal.extranet.dc.siemens.com/)  or later version Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* Siemens recommends disabling the integrated webserver when not in use* Please contact a Siemens office for additional support As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 3 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-148078](http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
