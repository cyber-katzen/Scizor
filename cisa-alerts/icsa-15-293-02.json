[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryIniNet Solutions SCADA Web Server Vulnerabilities================================================= Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-293\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Kirill Nesterov and Aleksandr Timorin of Positive Technologies have identified three vulnerabilities in IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s SCADA Web Server. IniNet Solutions GmbH has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SCADA Web Server versions are affected:* IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s SCADA Web Server, versions prior to Version 2\\.02\\. IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s SCADA Web Server is a third\\-party software that is used in industrial control system devices. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT is working with vendors to identify affected products that incorporate vulnerable versions of SCADA Web Server. ICS\\-CERT will update the advisory with additional affected products as more information becomes available. The IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s SCADA Web Server is known to be compatible and used with the following Beckhoff products:* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX1010,* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX1020,* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX1030,* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX2000,* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX5100, and* Beckhoff Embedded PC, series CX5000\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in SCADA Web Server could allow an attacker to manipulate and delete files, execute arbitrary code, and initiate a denial of service condition. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- IniNet Solutions GmbH is a Switzerland\\-based company. The affected product, SCADA Web Server, is a third\\-party web\\-based server software.

Multiple HTTP request fields are parsed by a function that does not check destination buffer size, which could allow an attacker to overflow the buffer that may allow remote code execution or a denial\\-of\\-service condition. CVE\\-2015\\-1001 NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-1001, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed October 20, 2015\\.### IMPROPER HANDLING OF URL ENCODING (HEX ENCODING)CWE\\-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/177\\.html, web site last accessed October 20, 2015\\. Security features could be evaded when input has been URL encoded that could allow unauthorized file manipulation and deletion. CVE\\-2015\\-1002 NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-1002, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed October 20, 2015\\.### PATH TRAVERSALCWE\\-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22\\.html, web site last accessed October 20, 2015\\. External input is used to construct paths to files and directories without properly neutralizing special elements within the pathname that could allow an attacker to read arbitrary OS files. CVE\\-2015\\-1003NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-1003, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

The new version can be obtained by contacting IniNet Solutions GmbH. IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s contact information is available at the following URL:[http://spidercontrol.net/contact/?L\\=1](http://spidercontrol.net/contact/?L=1)  .### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSET OWNERS WITH AFFECTED BECKHOFF PRODUCTS Asset owners of an identified Beckhoff product should determine if a vulnerable version of SCADA Web Server is in use. Asset owners using a vulnerable version of SCADA Web Server should contact their supplier or IniNet Solutions to obtain a new version of SCADA Web Server. Beckhoff has stated that IniNet Solutions products are not a Beckhoff product. SCADA Web Server is an application software by a third\\-party vendor developed and sold independent of Beckhoff. Beckhoff asserts that their (standard) products are not affected. ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Isolate vulnerable systems from the Internet and untrusted systems; however, if connectivity is required, use a VPN solution and implement network monitoring, recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.* Implement a runtime policy to prevent the use of any command that does not appear in a whitelist of allowable commands.* Utilize good design practices that include network segmentation; use DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic; and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems.* Maintain layered physical and logical security to implement defense\\-in\\-depth design practices for ICS environments.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
