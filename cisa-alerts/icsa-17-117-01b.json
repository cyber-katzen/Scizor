Part 2 of 2 ----------\nGE UR firmware versions 7.xx are not affected. GE has released updates that remove the ability to obtain the password cipher text in the following firmware versions:\n\nUniversal Relay, firmware Version 5.83,\nUniversal Relay, firmware Version 5.92, and\nUniversal Relay, firmware Version 6.02 to 6.05.\n\nThe Universal Relay firmware is available at the following location:\nhttps://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod=urfamily&type=7\nGE reports that the URplus platform will have firmware updates released in July 2017 for the following product versions:\n\nURplus, firmware Version 1.86,\nURplus, firmware Version 1.92, and\nB95Plus, firmware Version 1.03.\n\nGE recommends that users apply updated firmware versions to affected products, as well as implement the following physical security and network security defensive measures:\n\nControl access to affected products by keeping devices in a locked and secure environment,\nRemove passwords when decommissioning devices,\nMonitor and block malicious network activity, and\nImplement appropriate network segmentation and place affected devices within the control system network, behind properly configured firewalls. Protection and Control system devices should not be directly connected to the Internet or business networks.\n\nGE security advisory, SR-2017-00001 Multilin SR Family of Protective Relays, is available at the following location, with a valid account:\nhttps://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod=750&type=21\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nWEAK CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR PASSWORDS CWE-261\n\nCipher text versions of user passwords were created with a non-random initialization vector leaving them susceptible to dictionary attacks. Cipher text of user passwords can be obtained from the front LCD panel of affected products and through issued Modbus commands.\nCVE-2017-7905 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nGE reported the vulnerability to ICS-CERT. It was initially identified by New York University security researchers Anastasis Keliris, Charalambos Konstantinou, Marios Sazos, and Dr. Michail (Mihalis) Maniatakos.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: Boston, Massachusetts\n",
