GE recommends that users apply updated firmware versions to affected products, as well as implement the following physical security and network security defensive measures:* Control access to affected products by keeping devices in a locked and secure environment,* Remove passwords when decommissioning devices,* Monitor and block malicious network activity, and* Implement appropriate network segmentation and place affected devices within the control system network, behind properly configured firewalls. Protection and Control system devices should not be directly connected to the Internet or business networks. GE security advisory, SR\\-2017\\-00001 Multilin SR Family of Protective Relays, is available at the following location, with a valid account:[https://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod\\=750\\&type\\=21](https://www.gegridsolutions.com/app/ViewFiles.aspx?prod=750&type=21)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[WEAK CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR PASSWORDS CWE\\-261](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/261.html)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cipher text versions of user passwords were created with a non\\-random initialization vector leaving them susceptible to dictionary attacks.
