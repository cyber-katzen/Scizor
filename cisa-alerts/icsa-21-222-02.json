EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 5\\.9*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  Automation License Manager* **Vulnerability:**  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Automation License Manager are affected:* Automation License Manager 5: All versions* Automation License Manager 6: All versions prior to v6\\.0 SP9 Update 2### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Sending specially crafted packets to Port 4410/TCP of an affected system could lead to extensive memory consumption and a denial\\-of\\-service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.[CVE\\-2021\\-25659](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-25659)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users apply the following updates to mitigate this vulnerability:* Automation License Manager 6: [Update to v6\\.0 SP9 Update 2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/114358/)  or later Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:* On the Automation License Manager settings menu disable \u201cAllow Remote Connections.\u201d* If remote connections are needed, limit remote access to Port 4410/TCP to trusted systems only. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> For more information about this issue, please see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-158827](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-158827.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
