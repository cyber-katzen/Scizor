[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU Firmware Vulnerabilities===================================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-14\\-073\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Siemens and Positive Technology researchers (Yury Goltsev, Llya Karpov, Alexey Osipov, Dmitry Serebryannikov and Alex Timorin) have identified nine firmware vulnerabilities in the Siemens SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU Firmware. Siemens has produced a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following SIMATIC S7\\-1500 versions are affected:* SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU family, all versions older than V1\\.5IMPACT------ The multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU firmware may allow attackers to perform denial\\-of\\-service (DoS) attacks with specially crafted HTTP(S), ISO\\-TSAP, or Profinet network packets. The integrated web server may also be vulnerable to cross\\-site request forgery (CSRF), cross\\-site scripting (XSS), header injection, and open redirect attacks as well as privilege escalation. The vulnerabilities could be exploited over the network without authentication. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Products in the Siemens SIMATIC S7\\-1500 CPU family have been designed for process control in Critical Infrastructure Sectors such as Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### CROSS\\-SITE REQUEST FORGERYCWE\\-352: Cross\\-Site Request Forgery, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352\\.html, web site last accessed March 14, 2014\\.

Some will require additional user interaction.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with moderate skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.MITIGATION---------- Siemens addresses all these issues in a security advisory that can be found at the following location:[http://www.siemens.com/innovation/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens\\_security\\_advisory\\_ssa\\-456423\\.pdf](http://www.siemens.com/innovation/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-456423.pdf)  Siemens has provided a firmware update (V1\\.5\\.0\\), which fixes the reported vulnerabilities. Customers may obtain a copy of this firmware update at the following location:<http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/88613339> Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to S7\\-1500 CPUs with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises following recommended security practices and configuring the environment according to operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.[http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial\\-security/Documents/operational\\_guidelines\\_industrial\\_security\\_en.pdf](http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/Documents/operational_guidelines_industrial_security_en.pdf)  Siemens recommends operating the devices only within trusted networks (Information about Industrial Security by Siemens):<http://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity> ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.2.
