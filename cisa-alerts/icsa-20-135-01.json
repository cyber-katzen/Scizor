EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Opto 22\nEquipment: SoftPAC Project\nVulnerabilities: External Control of File Name or Path, Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, Improper Access Control, Uncontrolled Search Path Element, Improper Authorization\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary file write access with system access, start or stop service, allow remote code execution, and limit system availability.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Opto 22 SoftPAC Project, a virtual PLC, are affected:\n\nSoftPAC Project Version 9.6 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXTERNAL CONTROL OF FILE NAME OR PATH CWE-73\nPaths specified within the zip files used to update the SoftPAC firmware are not sanitized. As a result, an attacker with user privileges can gain arbitrary file write access with system access.\nCVE-2020-12042 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE-347\nSoftPAC\u2019s firmware files\u2019 signatures are not verified upon firmware update. This allows an attacker to replace legitimate firmware files with malicious files.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-12046 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nSoftPACAgent communicates with SoftPACMonitor over network Port 22000. However, this port is open without any restrictions. This allows an attacker with network access to control the SoftPACAgent service including updating SoftPAC firmware, starting or stopping service, or writing to certain registry values.\nCVE-2020-10612 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427\nSoftPAC does not specify the path of multiple imported .dll files. Therefore, an attacker can replace them and execute code whenever the service starts.\nCVE-2020-10616 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nSoftPAC communication does not include any credentials. This allows an attacker with network access to directly communicate with SoftPAC, including, for example, stopping the service remotely.\nCVE-2020-10620 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMashav Sapir of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOpto 22 released PAC Project 10.3; it is available for download by selecting one of the following links:\nPAC Project Professional\nPAC Project Basic\nQuestions concerning this release can be emailed to: support@opto22.com\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMonitor or restrict Port 22000 at the firewall.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
