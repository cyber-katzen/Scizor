When KingSCADA OPCServer and OPCClient are not on the same node, a remote attacker may obtain passwords to the system. DSecRG disclosed this vulnerability on its website without coordination with ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity. An exploit is known to be publicly available.\nICS-CERT has coordinated the mitigation of this vulnerability with WellinTech, which has produced a new version of KingSCADA that resolves the problem. ICS-CERT has not tested this version to verify that the vulnerability is resolved.\nAffected Products\nThe following WellinTech KingSCADA versions are affected:\n\nWellinTech KingSCADA 3.0.\n\nImpact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker with access to the password storage file to decode all passwords and use those passwords to access the system as a normal user.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nWellinTech is a software development company specializing in the Automation and Control industry based in Beijing, China. According to WellinTech, they also have branches in United States, Japan, Singapore, Europe, and Taiwan.\nThe WellinTech website describes KingSCADA as a Windows-based control, monitoring, and data collection application used across several industries including power, water, building automation, mining, and other sectors.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nInsecure Password EncryptionCWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html, website last accessed May 08, 2012.\nSystem passwords are stored in a file format that is easy for an attacker to decode. If an attacker is able to access and decode this file, he will be able to log into the system as a normal user or administrator.\nCVE-2012-1977 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS V2 base score of 7.2 has also been assigned.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nPublic exploit(s) are known to target this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMitigation\nWellinTech has provided the following link to the latest version of KingSCADA: http://download.kingview.com/software/KingSCADA/EN/KingSCADA3.1_2012-04-16EN.rar.\nAccording to WellinTech, this new version securely hashes passwords. ICS-CERT has not tested the new version to verify this.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
