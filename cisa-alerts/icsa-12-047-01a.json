MITIGATION Advantech has created a new version of WebAccess (7\\.0\\) that addresses these vulnerabilities. [Advantech WebAccess security update, http://webaccess.advantech.com/security.php, website last accessed February 15, 2012\\.](#_ftn1)  This new version can be obtained at: <http://webaccess.advantech.com/downloads.php> . Advantech recommends that the new version be installed over the existing installation. If the existing version of WebAccess is uninstalled, the computer must be rebooted before reinstalling WebAccess. Advantech recommends that customers using the WebAccess product refer to security considerations recommended by their installation manual. [WebAccess Quick Installation Guide, BroadWin, http://broadwin.com/Manual/InstallGuide/InstallGuide.htm , website last accessed February 15, 2012\\.](#_ftn2)  For further assistance, customers should contact BroadWin support at [support@broadwin.com](mailto:support@broadwin.com)  . [WebAccess customer notification, http://www.advantechdirect.com/eMarketingPrograms/WebAccess\\_Patch/WebAccess\\_Vulnerability.htm , website last accessed February 15, 2012\\.](#_ftn3)  ICST, iSIGHT, and ICS\\-CERT have validated that the new version mitigates Vulnerabilities 1 and 5\\-16\\. For Vulnerabilities 2 and 3, the patched version fixes the issue for unauthenticated users; however, the problem still remains for nonadmin project users. Vulnerability 4 was not patched, because Advantech does not consider it to be a security risk. Neither ICS\\-CERT nor independent researchers have validated that the new version resolves Vulnerabilities 17 and 18\\. ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security [recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web site. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e\\-mail messages2.
