These vulnerabilities include:\n \n\n\n* Cross\\-site scripting (XSS)\n* SQL injection\n* Cross\\-site report forgery (CSRF)\n* Authentication issues.\n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities were reported separately by the nSense Vulnerability Coordination Team, Greg\u00a0MacManus of iSIGHT Partners, Kuang\\-Chun Hung of Security Research and Service Institute\\-Information and Communication Security Technology Center (ICST), Luigi Auriemma, Billy\u00a0Rios, Terry McCorkle, and Snake (alias).\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT has coordinated with Advantech, which has released a new version of WebAccess that addresses most of the reported vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities affect all versions of Advantech/BroadWin WebAccess prior to applying the patch (V7\\.0\\) listed in the mitigations below.\n \n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n An attacker can bypass authentication, gain administrative privileges, and remotely execute arbitrary code by exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Advantech/BroadWin WebAccess is a web\\-based human\\-machine interface product used in energy, manufacturing, and building automation systems. The installation base is across Asia, North America, North Africa, and the Middle East.\n \n\n\n\n WebAccess Client is available for computers running Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Server 2003\\.

Advantech recommends that the new version be installed over the existing installation. If the existing version of WebAccess is uninstalled, the computer must be rebooted before reinstalling WebAccess.\n \n\n\n\n Advantech recommends that customers using the WebAccess product refer to security considerations recommended by their installation manual.\n [WebAccess Quick Installation Guide, BroadWin, http://broadwin.com/Manual/InstallGuide/InstallGuide.htm , website last accessed February 15, 2012\\.](#_ftn2) \n\n\n\n\n For further assistance, customers should contact BroadWin support at\n [support@broadwin.com](mailto:support@broadwin.com) \n .\n [WebAccess customer notification, http://www.advantechdirect.com/eMarketingPrograms/WebAccess\\_Patch/WebAccess\\_Vulnerability.htm , website last accessed February 15, 2012\\.](#_ftn3) \n\n\n\n\n ICST, iSIGHT, and ICS\\-CERT have validated that the new version mitigates Vulnerabilities 1 and 5\\-16\\. For Vulnerabilities 2 and 3, the patched version fixes the issue for unauthenticated users; however, the problem still remains for nonadmin project users. Vulnerability 4 was not patched, because Advantech does not consider it to be a security risk. Neither ICS\\-CERT nor independent researchers have validated that the new version resolves Vulnerabilities 17 and 18\\.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security\n [recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web site. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n In addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n \n\n\n1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e\\-mail messages\n2.
