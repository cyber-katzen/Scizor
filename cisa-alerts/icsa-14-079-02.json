Siemens has produced a new product release that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SIMATIC S7-1200 versions are affected:\n\nSIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family, all versions prior to V4.0\n\nIMPACT\nThe six vulnerabilities discovered in the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU firmware may allow attackers to perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks with specially crafted HTTP(S), ISO-TSAP, or Profinet network packets. The integrated web server may also be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and privilege escalation. The vulnerabilities could be exploited over the network without authentication.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nProducts in the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 PLC family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in Critical Infrastructure Sectors such as Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, and Food and Agriculture.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF)CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html, web site last accessed March 20, 2014.\n\nThe integrated web server (Port 80/TCP and Port 443/TCP) of the affected PLCs could allow CSRF attacks, compromising integrity and availability of the affected device, if social engineering is used to cause an unsuspecting user to click on a malicious link.\nCVE-2014-2249NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2249, web site last accessed March 20, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Some will require additional user interaction.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low to moderate skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens addresses all these issues in a security advisory that can be found at the following location:http://www.siemens.com/innovation/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-654382.pdf\nSiemens has provided SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU product release V4.0.0, which fixes the reported vulnerabilities. Further details on the S7-1200 V4.0release can be found here:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/86567043\nSiemens strongly recommends protecting network access to S7-1200 CPUs with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens advises following recommended security practices and configuring the environment according to operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nLink to Siemens \"Operational Guidelines to Industrial Security\" (PDF, English)\nSiemens recommends operating the devices only within trusted networks (Information about Industrial Security by Siemens).\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
