MITIGATIONS--------------- Ypsomed has taken action to update the affected mylife Cloud backend services to mitigate the vulnerabilities affecting the mylife Cloud in versions prior to 1\\.7\\.2\\. Ypsomed recommends users with the affected mobile application to update to the latest available application Version 1\\.7\\.5 or later. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Apply defense\\-in\\-depth strategies. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Disable unnecessary accounts and services. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Where additional information is needed, refer to [existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health/cybersecurity)  issued by the FDA. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
