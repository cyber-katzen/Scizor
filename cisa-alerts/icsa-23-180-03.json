An attacker running these commands could reveal sensitive information such as software versions and web server file contents. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-36607](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-36607)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE\\-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)** \u200bThe affected TBox RTUs store hashed passwords using MD5 encryption, which is an insecure encryption algorithm. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-36608](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-36608)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 \u200b [INCLUSION OF FUNCTIONALITY FROM UNTRUSTED CONTROL SPHERE CWE\\-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)** \u200bThe affected TBox RTUs run OpenVPN with root privileges and can run user defined configuration scripts. An attacker could set up a local OpenVPN server and push a malicious script onto the TBox host to acquire root privileges. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-36609](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-36609)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.2 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [INSUFFICIENT ENTROPY CWE\\-331](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331.html)** \u200bThe affected TBox RTUs generate software security tokens using insufficient entropy. The random seed used to generate the software tokens is not initialized correctly, and other parts of the token are generated using predictable time\\-based values. An attacker with this knowledge could successfully brute force the token and authenticate themselves. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-36610](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-36610)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 \u200b [IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)** \u200bThe affected TBox RTUs allow low privilege users to access software security tokens of higher privilege. This could allow an attacker with \u201cuser\u201d privileges to access files requiring higher privileges by establishing an SSH session and providing the other tokens. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-36611](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-36611)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 \u200b [PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE\\-256](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html)** \u200bAll versions of the TWinSoft Configuration Tool store encrypted passwords as plaintext in memory. An attacker with access to system files could open a file to load the document into memory, including sensitive information associated with document, such as password. The attacker could then obtain the plaintext password by using a memory viewer. \u200b [CVE\\-2023\\-3395](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3395)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- \u200bOvarro recommends users update the affected products to the latest version by downloading the newest software version from the [Ovarro website](http://www.ovarro.com/)  in the \u201cCustomer Support\u201d section. \u200bIn addition to applying patches, Ovarro has identified the following workarounds: \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36607: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application. \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36608: Update to TWinSoft version 12\\.7\\.2 or later, which includes firmware version 1\\.50\\.598\\. \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36609: Update to TWinSoft version 12\\.7\\.2 or later, which includes firmware version 1\\.50\\.598\\. \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36610: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application. Setting a password on the application will also cause the retrieved application to be encrypted. \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36611: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application. Setting a password on the application will also cause the retrieved application to be encrypted. \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-3395: Use password protected files within the TBox software. This will prevent attackers from opening files to load passwords into memory in plaintext. \u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* \u200bMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* \u200bLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* \u200bWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. \u200bCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. \u200bCISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . \u200bAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . \u200bOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. \u200bNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
