MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n \u200bOvarro recommends users update the affected products to the latest version by downloading the newest software version from the\n [Ovarro website](http://www.ovarro.com/) \n in the \u201cCustomer Support\u201d section.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bIn addition to applying patches, Ovarro has identified the following workarounds:\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36607: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36608: Update to TWinSoft version 12\\.7\\.2 or later, which includes firmware version 1\\.50\\.598\\.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36609: Update to TWinSoft version 12\\.7\\.2 or later, which includes firmware version 1\\.50\\.598\\.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36610: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application. Setting a password on the application will also cause the retrieved application to be encrypted.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-36611: Disable SSH access through the integrated firewall and disable the user account SSH access by emptying its password in the application. Setting a password on the application will also cause the retrieved application to be encrypted.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCVE\\-2023\\-3395: Use password protected files within the TBox software. This will prevent attackers from opening files to load passwords into memory in plaintext.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* \u200bMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* \u200bLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* \u200bWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\n\n\n \u200bCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n \u200bCISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n .
