[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryEcava IntegraXor Vulnerabilities================================ Last Revised August 23, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-16\\-105\\-03OVERVIEW-------- Independent security researcher Marcus Richerson and Steven Seeley of Source Incite, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, independently identified vulnerabilities in Ecava\u2019s IntegraXor application. Ecava has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Marcus Richerson has tested the new version to validate that it resolves all the vulnerabilities, except for one incomplete fix, which Ecava plans to fully address in an upcoming release. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Ecava IntegraXor versions are affected:* IntegraXor, versions prior to Version 5\\.0, build 4522IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to gain full access to an affected system. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Ecava Sdn Bhd (Ecava) is a Malaysia\\-based software development company that provides the IntegraXor SCADA product. Ecava specializes in factory and process automation solutions. The affected product, IntegraXor, is a suite of tools used to create and run a web\\-based human\u2011machine interface for a SCADA system. According to Ecava, IntegraXor is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Ecava estimates that this product is used in multiple countries, with the largest installations based in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Poland, Canada, and Estonia.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATIONCWE\\-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319\\.html, web site last accessed April 14, 2016\\.

Ecava has resolved the authenticated SQL injection associated with operator and supervisor accounts. Ecava is planning to address the remaining risk to administrative accounts in an upcoming release. Ecava\u2019s new version of the IntegraXor software, Version 5\\.0, build 4522 is available for download at the following link:[http://www.integraxor.com/download/beta.msi?5\\.0\\.4525\\.2](http://www.integraxor.com/download/beta.msi?5.0.4525.2)  . Ecava recommends downloading the latest build to address the identified vulnerabilities. Ecava has released a vulnerability note, which is available at the following URL:[http://www.integraxor.com/blog/category/security/vulnerability\\-note/](http://www.integraxor.com/blog/category/security/vulnerability-note/)  . ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Restrict administrative access to the minimum number of required users.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
