MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric recommends users to apply the following mitigations to help reduce the risk of exploit:* Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP.* Within the Modicon M221 application, the user must:\t+ Disable all unused protocols, especially programming protocol, as described in section \u201cConfiguring Ethernet Network\u201d of EcoStruxure Machine Expert \\- Basic online help for the M221 PLC. This action will prevent unintended remote programming access.\t+ Set a password to protect the project.\t+ Set a password for read access on the controller.\t+ Set a different password for write access on the controller. Schneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices:* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \u201cProgram\u201d mode.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for which the devices were intended.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network, besides the intended network, to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
