EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Black Box\u00a0\nEquipment: KVM Switches and Extenders\nVulnerability: Path Traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive data on the built-in web servers of the affected devices.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following models and versions of Black Box KVMs, a Keyboard/Video/Mouse switch and extender, are affected:\n\nBlack Box KVM ACR1000A-R-R2: Firmware version v3.4.31307\nBlack Box KVM ACR1000A-T-R2: Firmware version v3.4.31307\nBlack Box KVM ACR1002A-T: Firmware version v3.4.31307\nBlack Box KVM ACR1002A-R: Firmware version v3.4.31307\nBlack Box KVM ACR1020A-T: Firmware version v3.4.31307\n\t\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nBlack Box KVM Firmware version 3.4.31307 on models ACR1000A-R-R2, ACR1000A-T-R2, ACR1002A-T, ACR1002A-R, and ACR1020A-T is vulnerable to path traversal, which may allow an attacker to steal user credentials and other sensitive information through local file inclusion.\nCVE-2022-4636 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: India\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered a public Proof of Concept (PoC) as authored by Ferhat \u00c7il and reported it to Black Box.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nBlack Box has provided an update to the firmware to mitigate this vulnerability and recommends all users update products to the latest versions:\n\nBlack Box KVM ACR1000A-R-R2: Update to firmware v3.6 or later\nBlack Box KVM ACR1000A-T-R2: Update to firmware v3.6 or later\nBlack Box KVM ACR1002A-T: Update to firmware v3.6 or later\nBlack Box KVM ACR1002A-R: Update to firmware v3.6 or later\nBlack Box KVM ACR1020A-T: Update to firmware v3.6 or later\n\nBlack Box recommends users seek advice from third-party equipment or software package(s) vendors to evaluate if this vulnerability impacts third-party equipment/software.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\u00a0\n",
