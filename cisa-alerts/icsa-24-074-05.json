EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 8.7\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: RUGGEDCOM APE1808\nVulnerabilities: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, External Control of File Name or Path, Improper Privilege Management, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Improper Certificate Validation, Out-of-bounds Write, Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute elevated actions, cause a denial-of-service, or execute arbitrary commands or code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens RUGGEDCOM APE1808, an application hosting platform, are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808: All versions with Fortinet NGFW\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nA heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake in the Curl package. If Curl is unable to resolve the address itself, it passes the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy. However, the maximum length of the hostname that can be passed is 255 bytes. If the hostname is longer, then Curl switches to the local name resolving and passes the resolved address only to the proxy. The local variable that instructs Curl to \"let the host resolve the name\" could obtain the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, resulting in the too-long hostname being copied to the target buffer instead of the resolved address, which was not the intended behavior.\nCVE-2023-38545\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0EXTERNAL CONTROL OF FILE NAME OR PATH CWE-73\nThis flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met. libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates \"easy handles\" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl provides a function call that duplicates an easy handle called curl_easy_duphandle. If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as none (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes). Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named none - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the program using libcurl, and if using the correct file format of course.\nCVE-2023-38546\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 3.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nAn improper privilege management vulnerability in a Fortinet FortiOS HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 and 7.2.5 and in a FortiProxy HA cluster version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1 allows an authenticated attacker to perform elevated actions via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.\nCVE-2023-44250\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nThe HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.\nCVE-2023-44487\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2023-44487. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nAn improper certificate validation vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS 7.0.0 - 7.0.13, 7.2.0 - 7.2.6 and 7.4.0 - 7.4.1 allows a remote and unauthenticated attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the FortiLink communication channel between the FortiOS device and FortiSwitch.\nCVE-2023-47537\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nA out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.4.0 through 7.4.2, 7.2.0 through 7.2.6, 7.0.0 through 7.0.13, 6.4.0 through 6.4.14, 6.2.0 through 6.2.15, 6.0.0 through 6.0.17, FortiProxy versions 7.4.0 through 7.4.2, 7.2.0 through 7.2.8, 7.0.0 through 7.0.14, 2.0.0 through 2.0.13, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6, 1.0.0 through 1.0.7 allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted requests.\nCVE-2024-21762\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0USE OF EXTERNALLY-CONTROLLED FORMAT STRING CWE-134\nA use of externally-controlled format string vulnerability in FortiOS fgfmd daemon may allow\na remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specially crafted requests.\nCVE-2024-23113\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808: Contact customer support to receive patch and update information.\n\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808 (CVE-2024-21762): Disable SSL VPN (disable webmode is NOT a valid workaround) (see\u00a0https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-015).\n\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808 (CVE-2024-23113): For each interface, remove the fgfm access (see\u00a0https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-029).\n\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-832273 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
