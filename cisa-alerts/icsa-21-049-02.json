FR Configurator2 provides comprehensive countermeasures that give the same countermeasure effect to other products.\u00a0\nInstall the fixed version of GT Designer3 on workstations running the products when communicating with GOT. GT Designer3 provides comprehensive countermeasures that give the same countermeasure effect to other products.\nInstall the fixed version of GX Works3 on the computer running the products when communicating with MELSEC. Fixed software products that communicate with GOT and FREQROL are currently under development. GX Works3 provides comprehensive countermeasures that deliver the same countermeasures to other products.\nOperate the products under an account that does not have administrator's privileges.\nInstall antivirus software in the computer running the products.\nRestrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary, and ensure they are not accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nUse virtual private network (VPN) when remote access is required.\n\nRefer to the Mitsubishi Electric advisory for details on how to check firmware version.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n",
