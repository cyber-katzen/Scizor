FR Configurator2 provides comprehensive countermeasures that give the same countermeasure effect to other products.\n* Install the fixed version of GT Designer3 on workstations running the products when communicating with GOT. GT Designer3 provides comprehensive countermeasures that give the same countermeasure effect to other products.\n* Install the fixed version of GX Works3 on the computer running the products when communicating with MELSEC. Fixed software products that communicate with GOT and FREQROL are currently under development. GX Works3 provides comprehensive countermeasures that deliver the same countermeasures to other products.\n* Operate the products under an account that does not have administrator's privileges.\n* Install antivirus software in the computer running the products.\n* Restrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary, and ensure they are not accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n* Use virtual private network (VPN) when remote access is required.\n\n\n\n Refer to the\n [Mitsubishi Electric advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-021_en.pdf) \n for details on how to check firmware version.\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) \n .
