Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.\nThe SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.\nThe actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim\u2019s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims\u2019 machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims\u2019 networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.\nAfter gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims\u2019 action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.\nAnalysis of tools found on victims\u2019 networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims\u2019 access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims\u2019 credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.\nSamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nNCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports. The reports represent four SamSam malware variants. This is not an exhaustive list.\n\nMAR-10219351.r1.v2 \u2013 SamSam1\nMAR-10166283.r1.v1 \u2013 SamSam2\nMAR-10158513.r1.v1 \u2013 SamSam3\nMAR-10164494.r1.v1 \u2013 SamSam4\n\nFor general information on ransomware, see the NCCIC Security Publication at https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/Ransomware.\n\nMitigations\n\nDHS and FBI recommend that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nAudit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.\nVerify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.\nEnable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.\nWhere possible, apply two-factor authentication.\nRegularly apply system and software updates.\nMaintain a good back-up strategy.\nEnable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.\nWhen creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider\u2019s best practices for remote access.\nEnsure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.\nRegulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.\nScan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nDisable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[1]\n\nContact Information\n\nTo report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact NCCIC, FBI, or the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division via the following information:\n\nNCCIC\n\nNCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov\n888-282-0870\n\n\nFBI\u2019s Cyber Division\n\nCyWatch@fbi.gov\n855-292-3937\n\n\nFBI through a local field office\n\nFeedback\nDHS strives to make this report a valuable tool for our partners and welcomes feedback on how this publication could be improved.
