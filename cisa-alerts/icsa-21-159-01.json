EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Johnson Controls\nEquipment: Metasys Servers, Engines, and Tools\nVulnerability: Improper Privilege Management\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could give an authenticated Metasys user an unintended level of access to the server file system, allowing them to access or modify system files by sending specifically crafted web messages to the Metasys system.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nJohnson Controls reports the vulnerability affects the following Metasys building automation products:\n\nMetasys: All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE-269\nMetasys servers, engines, and tools do not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, thus creating an unintended sphere of control for said actor.\nCVE\u20102021\u201027657 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Ireland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJakub Palaczynski reported the vulnerability to Johnson Controls, Inc.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nJohnson Controls recommends that users of versions earlier than 9.0 upgrade to a supported release. Users of Version 9.0 (engine), 10.0, 10.1, or 11.0 are recommended to install the patch.\nJohnson Controls also recommends the following additional mitigation steps:\n\nReview all user accounts that are active or dormant and determine if they are still required through the Dormant User feature.\nDelete any user accounts if the user is no longer with the company or have been reassigned to another position where they no longer need to use Metasys.\nMonitor the audit logs as well as the Cyber Health Dashboard if the site has a Metasys Server at Release 10.1 or later to monitor user activity.\nEnforce a password change across the Metasys site on a regular basis.\n\nPlease see Johnson Controls product security advisory number JCI\u2010PSA\u20102021\u201005 for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
