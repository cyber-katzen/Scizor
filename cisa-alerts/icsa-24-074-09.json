This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code on the underlying operating system with root privileges. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; code execution might be possible on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the engineering tool user account. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; code execution might be possible on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the engineering tool user account. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the app in the fire system network; possible impact is limited to the app, not the underlying operating system.\nCVE-2024-22039\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-22039. A base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H.\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe network communication library in affected systems insufficiently validates HMAC values which might result in a buffer overread. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash the network service. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; possible impact is limited to the tool, not the underlying operating system. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; possible impact is limited to the tool, not the underlying operating system. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the app in the fire system network; possible impact is limited to the app, not the underlying operating system.\nCVE-2024-22040\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u00a0CVE-2024-22040. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe network communication library in affected systems improperly handles memory buffers when parsing X.509 certificates. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash the network service. Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; possible impact is limited to the tool, not the underlying operating system.

To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-225840 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
