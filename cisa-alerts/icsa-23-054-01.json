EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor: PTC\u00a0\nEquipment: ThingWorx Edge\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: Improper Validation of Array Index, Integer Overflow or Wraparound\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash the device or could allow remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components of PTC ThingWorx are affected:\u00a0\n\nThingWorx Edge C-SDK: v2.2.12.1052 or lower\u00a0\n.NET-SDK: v5.8.4.971 or lower\u00a0\nThingWorx Edge MicroServer (EMS): v5.4.10.0 or lower\u00a0\nKepware KEPServerEX: v6.12 or lower\u00a0\nThingWorx Kepware Server (formerly ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity): v6.12 or lower\u00a0\nThingWorx Industrial Connectivity: All versions\u00a0\nThingWorx Kepware Edge: v1.5 or lower\u00a0\nRockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise: v6.12 or lower\u00a0\nGE Digital Industrial Gateway Server: v7.612 or lower\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 IMPROPER VALIDATION OF ARRAY INDEX CWE-129 \u00a0\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an improper validation of array index, which could allow an attacker to crash the server and remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0755 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2 INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190\u00a0\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an integer overflow or wraparound, which could allow an attacker to crash the server and remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0754 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nChris Anastasio and Steven Seeley of Incite Team reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPTC released the following resolutions:\u00a0\nUpdate the impacted product to the latest version:\u00a0\n\nThingWorx Edge C-SDK: 3.0.0 or later.\u00a0\nThingWorx Edge MicroServer (EMS): v5.4.11 or later.\u00a0\n.NET-SDK: v5.8.5 or later.\u00a0\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated for Kepware products if the ThingWorx Interface is not enabled. To use the ThingWorx Interface without the vulnerability, update to the latest version of the product:\u00a0\n\nKepware KEPServerEX: v6.13 or later.\u00a0\nThingWorx Kepware Server (formerly ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity): v6.13 or later.\u00a0\nThingWorx Kepware Edge: v1.6 or later.\u00a0\n\nThe following products should be upgraded as indicated or in accordance with the applicable organization\u2019s recommendations if the ThingWorx Interface is in use: \u00a0\n\nRockwell Automation KEPServer Enterprise: v6.13 or later.\u00a0\nGE Digital Industrial Gateway Server: v7.613 or later.\u00a0\nFor more information, see PTC\u2019s Customer Support Article\u00a0(login required).\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. \u00a0\nPlease share your thoughts.\nWe recently updated our anonymous Product Feedback; we'd welcome your feedback.\n",
