A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH DISCREPANCY CWE-203\nThe application suffers from a username enumeration weakness. The device behaves differently or sends different responses in a way that may expose security-relevant information about the state of the product.\nCVE-2019-10848 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nSpecific parameters passed to scripts is not sanitized before being returned to the user, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in a user\u2019s browser session in context of an affected site.\nCVE-2019-10846 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\nThe application incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component, which could allow attackers to execute commands directly on the operating system.\nCVE-2019-10854 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INFORMATION EXPOSURE THROUGH SOURCE CODE CWE-540\nThe application has an unprotected subversion directory, which may allow an attacker to download the entire firmware codebase and discover sensitive information about the inner workings of the underlying OS.\nCVE-2019-10849 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\nSeveral scripts contain a hard-coded encryption key for database backup file decryption, which may allow an authenticated attacker to gain access to the full database of the device and discover sensitive information.\nCVE-2019-10851 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nImproper validation of parameters passed to different scripts may allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands in the application\u2019s database.\nCVE-2019-10852 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\nSending specific parameters to a function will enable the auth flag, which may allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain full control of the device.\nCVE-2019-10853 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nThe application stores the passwords in the database using the MD5 hash. The MD5 algorithm is vulnerable to known cryptographic attacks, which may allow discovery of passwords.\nCVE-2019-10855 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: North America\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nGjoko Krstic of Applied Risk reported these vulnerabilities to Computrols.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nComputrols recommends users upgrade to the following versions or later for each respective major versions of CBAS Web:\n\n19.0.1\n18.0.1\n15.0.1\n14.0.1\n8.0.7\n7.2.1-Beta\n6.9.2\n4.8.2\n3.15.1\n\nUpdated software can be obtained by contacting Computrols Technical Support:\nhttp://www.computrols.com/support/technical-support/\nFor more information, see the Computrols security advisory at the following link:\nhttp://www.computrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CBAS-Web-Advisory-2019-5-9.pdf\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
