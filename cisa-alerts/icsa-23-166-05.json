  "markdown": "\nAs of January 10, 2023, CISA will no longer be updating ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities beyond the initial advisory. For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u202fSiemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 3.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable from an adjacent network\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC Products\nVulnerability: Use of Obsolete Function\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to product control and data.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products from Siemens are affected:\n\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V14: All versions\nSIMATIC NET PC Software V15: All versions\nSIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2: All versions\nSIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0: All versions\nSIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1: All versions\nSIMATIC WinCC: All versions prior to V8.0\nSINAUT Software ST7sc: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0USE OF OBSOLETE FUNCTION CWE-477\nBefore SIMATIC WinCC V8, legacy OPC services (OPC DA (Data Access), OPC HDA (Historical Data Access), and OPC AE (Alarms & Events)) were used per default. These services were designed on top of the Windows ActiveX and DCOM mechanisms, and do not implement state-of-the-art security mechanisms for authentication and encryption of contents.\nCVE-2023-28829 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.9 has been calculated. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSIMATIC WinCC: Update to V8.0 or later\nSINATIC NET PC Software: Ensure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC Net group\nEnsure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC HMI group\nDisable the legacy OPC DA/HDA/AE services and switch to OPC UA, if possible\n\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-508677 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
