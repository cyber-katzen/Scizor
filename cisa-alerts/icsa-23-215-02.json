MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends updating to the following mitigated version to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:* \u200bGT Designer3 Version1 (GOT2000\\): Update to v1\\.300N or later* \u200bGT SoftGOT2000: Update to v1\\.300N or later* \u200bGOT2000 (Models GT21, GT23, GT25, GT27\\): Update to v01\\.50\\.000 or later* \u200bGOT SIMPLE (Models GS25, GS21\\): Update to v01\\.50\\.000 or later \u200bMitsubishi Electric recommends taking applying the following mitigations to minimize the risk of exploiting this vulnerability:* \u200bEncrypt communication paths to the affected product with a VPN or other means.* \u200bWhen internet access is required, use a virtual private network (VPN) or other means to prevent unauthorized access.* \u200bUse the affected products within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.* \u200bPrevent physical access to the network to which the product is connected.* \u200bInstall antivirus software on your personal computer that can access the affected product.* \u200bUse the IP filter function to restrict the accessible IP addresses.\t+ \u200bFor details on the IP filter function, please refer to GT Designer3 (GOT2000\\) Screen Design Manual (SH\\-081220ENG), \u201c5\\.4\\.3 Setting the IP filter.\u201d \u200bFor update instructions and additional information, refer to [Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s security bulletin](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2023-008_en.pdf)  . \u200bCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* \u200bMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* \u200bLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* \u200bWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. \u200bCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. \u200bCISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . \u200bAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . \u200bOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. \u200bNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
