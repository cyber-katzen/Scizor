The advisory highlights the cyber threat posed by North Korea \u2013 formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) \u2013 and provides recommended steps to mitigate the threat. In particular, Annex 1 lists U.S. government resources related to DPRK cyber threats and Annex 2 includes a link to the UN 1718 Sanctions Committee (DPRK) Panel of Experts reports.\nThe DPRK\u2019s malicious cyber activities threaten the United States and the broader international community and, in particular, pose a significant threat to the integrity and stability of the international financial system.\u00a0Under the pressure of robust U.S. and UN sanctions, the DPRK has increasingly relied on illicit activities \u2013 including cybercrime \u2013 to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. In particular, the United States is deeply concerned about North Korea\u2019s malicious cyber activities, which the U.S. government refers to as HIDDEN COBRA.\u00a0The DPRK has the capability to conduct disruptive or destructive cyber activities affecting U.S. critical infrastructure.\u00a0The DPRK also uses cyber capabilities to steal from financial institutions, and has demonstrated a pattern of disruptive and harmful cyber activity that is wholly inconsistent with the growing international consensus on what constitutes responsible State behavior in cyberspace.\u00a0\nThe United States works closely with like-minded countries to focus attention on and condemn the DPRK\u2019s disruptive, destructive, or otherwise destabilizing behavior in cyberspace.\u00a0For example, in December 2017, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom publicly attributed the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack to the DPRK and denounced the DPRK\u2019s harmful and irresponsible cyber activity.\u00a0Denmark and Japan issued supporting statements for the joint denunciation of the destructive WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack, which affected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world in May 2017.\u00a0\nIt is vital for the international community, network defenders, and the public to stay vigilant and to work together to mitigate the cyber threat posed by North Korea.\u00a0\nClick here for an English PDF version of this report.\nClick the following links for PDF versions of this report in Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and traditional Chinese, and Vietnamese.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nDPRK\u2019s Malicious Cyber Activities Targeting the Financial Sector\nMany DPRK cyber actors are subordinate to UN- and U.S.-designated entities, such as the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\u00a0DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors primarily consist of hackers, cryptologists, and software developers who conduct espionage, cyber-enabled theft targeting financial institutions and digital currency exchanges, and politically-motivated operations against foreign media companies.\u00a0They develop and deploy a wide range of malware tools around the world to enable these activities and have grown increasingly sophisticated.\u00a0Common tactics to raise revenue illicitly by DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors include, but are not limited to:\nCyber-Enabled Financial Theft and Money Laundering.\u00a0The UN Security Council 1718 Committee Panel of Experts\u2019 2019 mid-term report (2019 POE mid-term report) states that the DPRK is increasingly able to generate revenue notwithstanding UN Security Council sanctions by using malicious cyber activities to steal from financial institutions through increasingly sophisticated tools and tactics.\u00a0The 2019 POE mid-term report notes that, in some cases, these malicious cyber activities have also extended to laundering funds through multiple jurisdictions. The 2019 POE mid-term report mentions that it was investigating dozens of suspected DPRK cyber-enabled heists and that, as of late 2019, the DPRK has attempted to steal as much as $2 billion through these illicit cyber activities.\u00a0Allegations in a March 2020 Department of Justice forfeiture complaint are consistent with portions of the POE\u2019s findings. Specifically, the forfeiture complaint alleged how North Korean cyber actors used North Korean infrastructure in furtherance of their conspiracy to hack digital currency exchanges, steal hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency, and launder the funds.\nExtortion Campaigns.\u00a0DPRK cyber actors have also conducted extortion campaigns against third-country entities by compromising an entity\u2019s network and threatening to shut it down unless the entity pays a ransom. In some instances, DPRK cyber actors have demanded payment from victims under the guise of long-term paid consulting arrangements in order to ensure that no such future malicious cyber activity takes place.\u00a0DPRK cyber actors have also been paid to hack websites and extort targets for third-party clients.\nCryptojacking.\u00a0The 2019 POE mid-term report states that the POE is also investigating the DPRK\u2019s use of \u201ccryptojacking,\u201d a scheme to compromise a victim machine and steal its computing resources to mine digital currency.\u00a0The POE has identified several incidents in which computers infected with cryptojacking malware sent the mined assets \u2013 much of it anonymity-enhanced digital currency (sometimes also referred to as \u201cprivacy coins\u201d) \u2013 to servers located in the DPRK, including at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang.\nThese activities highlight the DPRK\u2019s use of cyber-enabled means to generate revenue while mitigating the impact of sanctions and show that any country can be exposed to and exploited by the DPRK.\u00a0According to the 2019 POE mid-term report, the POE is also investigating such activities as attempted violations of UN Security Council sanctions on the DPRK.\nCyber Operations Publicly Attributed to DPRK by U.S. Government\nThe DPRK has repeatedly targeted U.S. and other government and military networks, as well as networks related to private entities and critical infrastructure, to steal data and conduct disruptive and destructive cyber activities.\u00a0To date, the U.S. government has publicly attributed the following cyber incidents to DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors and co-conspirators:\n\nSony Pictures. In November 2014, DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors allegedly launched a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in retaliation for the 2014 film \u201cThe Interview.\u201d\u00a0DPRK cyber actors hacked into SPE\u2019s network to steal confidential data, threatened SPE executives and employees, and damaged thousands of computers.\u00a0\n\nFBI\u2019s Update on Sony Investigation (Dec. 19, 2014) https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation\nDOJ\u2019s Criminal Complaint of a North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer (Sept. 6, 2018) https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and\u00a0\n\n\nBangladesh Bank Heist. In February 2016, DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors allegedly attempted to steal at least $1 billion from financial institutions across the world and allegedly stole $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank through unauthorized transactions on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network.\u00a0According to the complaint, DPRK cyber actors accessed the Bangladesh Bank\u2019s computer terminals that interfaced with the SWIFT network after compromising the bank\u2019s computer network via spear phishing emails targeting bank employees. DPRK cyber actors then sent fraudulently authenticated SWIFT messages directing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer funds out of the Bangladesh Bank\u2019s Federal Reserve account to accounts controlled by the conspirators.\n\nDOJ\u2019s Criminal Complaint of a North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer (Sept. 6, 2018) https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and\n\n\nWannaCry 2.0.\u00a0DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors developed the ransomware known as WannaCry 2.0, as well as two prior versions of the ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry 2.0 ransomware infected hundreds of thousands of computers in hospitals, schools, businesses, and homes in over 150 countries.\u00a0 WannaCry 2.0 ransomware encrypts an infected computer\u2019s data and allows the cyber actors to demand ransom payments in the Bitcoin digital currency.\u00a0The Department of the Treasury designated one North Korean computer programmer for his part in the WannaCry 2.0 conspiracy, as well as his role in the Sony Pictures cyber attack and Bangladesh Bank heist, and additionally designated the organization he worked for.\n\nCISA\u2019s Technical Alert: Indicators Associated with WannaCry Ransomware (May 12, 2017) https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-132A\nWhite House Press Briefing on the Attribution of WannaCry Ransomware (Dec. 19, 2017) https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-on-the-attribution-of-the-wannacry-malware-attack-to-north-korea-121917/\nDOJ\u2019s Criminal Complaint of a North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer (Sept. 6, 2018) https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and\nTreasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks (Sept. 6, 2018) https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm473\n\n\nFASTCash Campaign.\u00a0Since late 2016, DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors have employed a fraudulent ATM cash withdrawal scheme known as \u201cFASTCash\u201d to steal tens of millions of dollars from ATMs in Asia and Africa.\u00a0 FASTCash schemes remotely compromise payment switch application servers within banks to facilitate fraudulent transactions. In one incident in 2017, DPRK cyber actors enabled the withdrawal of cash simultaneously from ATMs located in more than 30 different countries. In another incident in 2018, DPRK cyber actors enabled cash to be simultaneously withdrawn from ATMs in 23 different countries.\u00a0\n\nCISA\u2019s Alert on FASTCash Campaign (Oct. 2, 2018) https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A\nCISA\u2019s Malware Analysis Report: FASTCash-Related Malware (Oct. 2, 2018) https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-275A\n\n\nDigital Currency Exchange Hack.\u00a0As detailed in allegations set forth in a Department of Justice complaint for forfeiture in rem, in April 2018, DPRK state-sponsored cyber actors hacked into a digital currency exchange and stole nearly $250 million worth of digital currency.\u00a0The complaint further described how the stolen assets were laundered through hundreds of automated digital currency transactions, to obfuscate the origins of the funds, in an attempt to prevent law enforcement from tracing the assets.\u00a0Two Chinese nationals are alleged in the complaint to have subsequently laundered the assets on behalf of the North Korean group, receiving approximately $91 million from DPRK-controlled accounts, as well as an additional $9.5 million from a hack of another exchange.\u00a0In March 2020, the Department of the Treasury designated the two individuals under cyber and DPRK sanctions authorities, concurrent with a Department of Justice announcement that the individuals had been previously indicted on money laundering and unlicensed money transmitting charges and that 113 digital currency accounts were subject to forfeiture.\n\nTreasury\u2019s Sanctions against Individuals Laundering Cryptocurrency for Lazarus Group (March 2, 2020) https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm924\nDOJ\u2019s Indictment of Two Chinese Nationals Charged with Laundering Cryptocurrency from Exchange Hack and Civil Forfeiture Complaint (March 2, 2020) https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-nationals-charged-laundering-over-100-million-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack\n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\nMeasures to Counter the DPRK Cyber Threat\nNorth Korea targets cyber-enabled infrastructure globally to generate revenue for its regime priorities, including its weapons of mass destruction programs.\u00a0We strongly urge governments, industry, civil society, and individuals to take all relevant actions below to protect themselves from and counter the DPRK cyber threat:\n\nRaise Awareness of the DPRK Cyber Threat. Highlighting the gravity, scope, and variety of malicious cyber activities carried out by the DPRK will raise general awareness across the public and private sectors of the threat and promote adoption and implementation of appropriate preventive and risk mitigation measures.\nShare Technical Information of the DPRK Cyber Threat.\u00a0Information sharing at both the national and international levels to detect and defend against the DPRK cyber threat will enable enhanced cybersecurity of networks and systems.\u00a0 Best practices should be shared with governments and the private sector.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501\u20131510), non-federal entities may share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures related to HIDDEN COBRA with federal and non-federal entities.\nImplement and Promote Cybersecurity Best Practices.\u00a0Adopting measures \u2013 both technical and behavioral \u2013 to enhance cybersecurity will make U.S. and global cyber infrastructure more secure and resilient.\u00a0Financial institutions, including money services businesses, should take independent steps to protect against malicious DPRK cyber activities.\u00a0Such steps may include, but are not limited to, sharing threat information through government and/or industry channels, segmenting networks to minimize risks, maintaining regular backup copies of data, undertaking awareness training on common social engineering tactics, implementing policies governing information sharing and network access, and developing cyber incident response plans.\u00a0The Department of Energy\u2019s Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model and the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework provide guidance on developing and implementing robust cybersecurity practices. As shown in Annex I, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides extensive resources, including technical alerts and malware analysis reports, to enable network defenders to identify and reduce exposure to malicious cyber activities.\nNotify Law Enforcement.\u00a0If an organization suspects that it has been the victim of malicious cyber activity, emanating from the DPRK or otherwise, it is critical to notify law enforcement in a timely fashion.\u00a0 This not only can expedite the investigation, but also, in the event of a financial crime, can increase the chances of recovering any stolen assets.\n\tU.S. law enforcement has seized millions of dollars\u2019 worth of digital currency stolen by North Korean cyber actors.\u00a0 All types of financial institutions, including money services businesses, are encouraged to cooperate on the front end by complying with U.S. law enforcement requests for information regarding these cyber threats, and on the back end by identifying forfeitable assets upon receipt of a request from U.S. law enforcement or U.S. court orders, and by cooperating with U.S. law enforcement to support the seizure of such assets.\nStrengthen Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) / Counter-Proliferation Financing (CPF) Compliance.\u00a0 Countries should swiftly and effectively implement the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on AML/CFT/CPF.\u00a0 This includes ensuring financial institutions and other covered entities employ risk mitigation measures in line with the FATF standards and FATF public statements and guidance.\u00a0 Specifically, the FATF has called for all countries to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from the ongoing money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risks emanating from the DPRK.[1]\u00a0 This includes advising all financial institutions and other covered entities to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with the DPRK, including DPRK companies, financial institutions, and those acting on their behalf.\u00a0 In line with UN Security Council Resolution 2270 Operative Paragraph 33, Member States should close existing branches, subsidiaries, and representative offices of DPRK banks within their territories and terminate correspondent relationships with DPRK banks.\nFurther, in June 2019, FATF amended its standards to require all countries regulate and supervise digital asset service providers, including digital currency exchanges, and mitigate against risks when engaging in digital currency transactions. Digital asset service providers should remain alert to changes in customers\u2019 activities, as their business may be used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. The United States is particularly concerned about platforms that provide anonymous payment and account service functionality without transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and customer due diligence, among other obligations.\n\tU.S. financial institutions, including foreign-located digital asset service providers doing business in whole or substantial part in the United States, and other covered businesses and persons should ensure that they comply with their regulatory obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (as implemented through the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulations in 31 CFR Chapter X).\u00a0 For financial institutions, these obligations include\u00a0 developing and maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs that are reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, as well as identifying and reporting suspicious transactions, including those conducted, affected, or facilitated by cyber events or illicit finance involving digital assets, in suspicious activity reporting to FinCEN. \n\n\nInternational Cooperation\nTo counter the DPRK\u2019s malicious cyber activities, the United States regularly engages with countries around the world to raise awareness of the DPRK cyber threat by sharing information and evidence via diplomatic, military, law enforcement and judicial, network defense, and other channels.\u00a0 To hamper the DPRK\u2019s efforts to steal funds through cyber means and to defend against the DPRK\u2019s malicious cyber activities, the United States strongly urges countries to strengthen network defense, shutter DPRK joint ventures in third countries, and expel foreign-located North Korean information technology (IT) workers in a manner consistent with applicable international law.\u00a0 A 2017 UN Security Council resolution required all Member States to repatriate DPRK nationals earning income abroad, including IT workers, by December 22, 2019.\u00a0 The United States also seeks to enhance the capacity of foreign governments and the private sector to understand, identify, defend against, investigate, prosecute, and respond to DPRK cyber threats and participate in international efforts to help ensure the stability of cyberspace.\u00a0\nConsequences of Engaging in Prohibited or Sanctionable Conduct\nIndividuals and entities engaged in or supporting DPRK cyber-related activity, including processing related financial transactions, should be aware of the potential consequences of engaging in prohibited or sanctionable conduct.\nThe Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has the authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to have, among other things:\n\nEngaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity on behalf of the Government of North Korea or the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea;\nOperated in the information technology (IT) industry in North Korea;\nEngaged in certain other malicious cyber-enabled activities; or\nEngaged in at least one significant importation from or exportation to North Korea of any goods, services, or technology.\n\nAdditionally, if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that a foreign financial institution has knowingly conducted or facilitated significant trade with North Korea, or knowingly conducted or facilitated a significant transaction on behalf of a person designated under a North Korea-related Executive Order, or under Executive Order 13382 (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters) for North Korea-related activity, that institution may, among other potential restrictions, lose the ability to maintain a correspondent or payable-through account in the United States.\nOFAC investigates apparent violations of its sanctions regulations and exercises enforcement authority, as outlined in the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, appendix A.\u00a0Persons who violate the North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 510, may face civil monetary penalties of up to the greater of the applicable statutory maximum penalty or twice the value of the underlying transaction.\nThe 2019 POE mid-term report notes the DPRK\u2019s use, and attempted use, of cyber-enabled means to steal funds from banks and digital currency exchanges could violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) (i.e., UNSCR 1718 operative paragraph (OP) 8(d); UNSCR 2094, OPs 8 and 11; and UNSCR 2270, OP 32).\u00a0The DPRK-related UNSCRs also provide various mechanisms for encouraging compliance with DPRK-related sanctions imposed by the UN.\u00a0For example, the UN Security Council 1718 Committee may impose targeted sanctions (i.e., an asset freeze and, for individuals, a travel ban) on any individual or entity who engages in a business transaction with UN-designated entities or sanctions evasion.\u00a0\nThe Department of Justice criminally prosecutes willful violations of applicable sanctions laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 et seq.\u00a0 Persons who willfully violate such laws may face up to 20 years of imprisonment, fines of up to $1 million or totaling twice the gross gain, whichever is greater, and forfeiture of all funds involved in such transactions.\u00a0The Department of Justice also criminally prosecutes willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5318 and 5322, which requires financial institutions to, among other things, maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file certain reports with FinCEN.\u00a0Persons violating the BSA may face up to 5 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $250,000, and potential forfeiture of property involved in the violations.\u00a0Where appropriate, the Department of Justice will also criminally prosecute corporations and other entities that violate these statutes.\u00a0The Department of Justice also works with foreign partners to share evidence in support of each other\u2019s criminal investigations and prosecutions.\nPursuant to 31 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f5318(k), the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General may subpoena a foreign financial institution that maintains a correspondent bank account in the United States for records stored overseas.\u00a0Where the Secretary of the Treasury or Attorney General provides written notice to a U.S. financial institution that a foreign financial institutions has failed to comply with such a subpoena, the U.S. financial institution must terminate the correspondent banking relationship within ten business days.\u00a0Failure to do so may subject the U.S. financial institutions to daily civil penalties.\nDPRK Rewards for Justice\nIf you have information about illicit DPRK activities in cyberspace, including past or ongoing operations, providing such information through the Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice program could make you eligible to receive an award of up to $5 million.\u00a0For further details, please visit www.rewardsforjustice.net.\nANNEX I: USG Public Information on and Resources to Counter the DPRK Cyber Threat\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence Annual Worldwide Threat Assessments of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\u00a0 In 2019, the U.S. Intelligence Community assessed that the DPRK poses a significant cyber threat to financial institutions, remains a cyber espionage threat, and retains the ability to conduct disruptive cyber attacks.\u00a0The DPRK continues to use cyber capabilities to steal from financial institutions to generate revenue.\u00a0Pyongyang\u2019s cybercrime operations include attempts to steal more than $1.1 billion from financial institutions across the world \u2013 including a successful cyber heist of an estimated $81 million from Bangladesh Bank.\u00a0The report can be found at https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf.\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Technical Reports.\u00a0The U.S. government refers to the malicious cyber activities by the DPRK as HIDDEN COBRA.\u00a0HIDDEN COBRA reports provide technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by DPRK cyber actors.\u00a0These reports enable network defenders to identify and reduce exposure to the DPRK\u2019s malicious cyber activities.\u00a0CISA\u2019s website contains the latest updates on these persistent threats: https://www.us-cert.gov/northkorea.\u00a0\nAdditionally, CISA provides extensive cybersecurity and infrastructure security knowledge and practices to its stakeholders, shares that knowledge to enable better risk management, and puts it into practice to protect the nation\u2019s critical functions.\u00a0Below are the links to CISA\u2019s resources:\n\nProtecting Critical Infrastructure:
