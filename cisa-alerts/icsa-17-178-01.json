[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryNewport XPS\\-Cx, XPS\\-Qx======================== Last Revised June 27, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-178\\-01### **CVSS v3 7\\.5****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Newport**Equipment:**  XPS\\-Cx, XPS\\-Qx**Vulnerability:**  Improper AuthenticationAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of XPS\\-Cx and XPS\\-Qx, a universal motion controller, are affected:* XPS\\-Cx all versions, and* XPS\\-Qx all versions.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to view and edit settings without authenticating by accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL).MITIGATION---------- Newport reports that this issue will be addressed in the next generation XPS\\-Dx controller. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT and Newport recommend that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Not connect control components and control networks to an open network such as the Internet or an office network. Newport recommends putting control components and control networks behind a firewall.* Limit physical and electronic access to all automation components to authorized personnel only.* Change the default passwords before first use. This will reduce the risk of unauthorized access to systems.* Regularly change passwords. This will reduce the risk of unauthorized access to systems.* If remote access to control components and control networks is required, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).* Regularly perform threat analyses. Check whether the measures taken meet company security requirements.* Use \u201cdefense\\-in\\-depth\u201d mechanisms in the system\u2019s security configuration to restrict the access to and control of individual products and networks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An attacker may bypass authentication by accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL).[CVE\\-2017\\-7919](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-7919)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
