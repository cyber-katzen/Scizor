Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79\n\nInput sent from a malicious client is not properly verified by the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in another user\u2019s browser session.\nCVE-2017-5164 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\n\nLack of authentication for remote service gives access to application set up and configuration.\nCVE-2017-5162 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nCROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\n\nThere is no CSRF Token generated per page and/or per (sensitive) function. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as configuration parameter changes, and saving modified configuration.\nCVE-2017-5165 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n\nINFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200\n\nThis flaw can be used to gain privileged access to the device.\nCVE-2017-5166 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nHARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\n\nUsers do not have any option to change their own passwords.\nCVE-2017-5167 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\nRESEARCHER\nKarn Ganeshen reported these vulnerabilities.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector(s): Energy\nCountries Deployed: Russia\nCompany Headquarters Location: St Petersburg, Russia\n",
