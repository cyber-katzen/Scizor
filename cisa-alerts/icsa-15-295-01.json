Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems has already released a revision that eliminates this vulnerability (see ICSA\\-15\\-006\\-01 Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Series Form 6 Control and Idea/IdeaPlus Relays with Ethernet VulnerabilityICSA\\-15\\-006\\-01 \\- Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Series Form 6 Control and Idea/IdeaPlus Relays with Ethernet Vulnerability, https://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA\\-15\\-006\\-01, web site last accessed November 24, 2015\\.). This advisory serves as a notification of a new vulnerability in the previous software version. The researchers have tested the revision to validate that it resolves the reported vulnerability.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:\n \n\n\n* Previous versions of Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Series Form 6 control and Idea/IdeaPLUS relays with Ethernet using Pro View 4\\.0 through Pro View 5\\.0 firmware versions.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n IEEE 802 specifies that packets have a minimum size of 56 bytes. The Ethernet driver is expected to fill the data field with octets of zero for padding when packets are less than 56 bytes. Resident memory and other data are used for padding in some implementations that could cause information leakage. This attack is passive; the attacker can only see data that the affected devices sent out as part of a packet.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems division is a US\\-based company that maintains offices worldwide.\n \n\n\n\n The affected products, Form 6 control and Idea/IdeaPLUS relay protection platforms, are deployed by power grid operators to apply protection and communications support for overcurrent devices such as reclosers and circuit breakers. According to Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems division, these products are used primarily in the Energy Sector. Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems division estimates these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n\n**IMPROPER ETHERNET FRAME PADDINGCWE\\-226: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Release, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/226\\.html, web site last accessed November 24, 2015\\.** \n\n\n\n\n\n The data padding within the data field of the Ethernet pack should be all zeros. The previous implementation of firmware allowed other data from a known area of memory to be used in this field and could exfiltrate or leak data.\n \n\n\n\n\n CVE\\-2015\\-6471NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-6471, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. as been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 and a temporal score of 5\\.1 have been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3\\.0\\#CVSS:3\\.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C, web site last accessed November 24, 2015\\.\n \n\n\n### VULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\n\n#### EXPLOITABILITY\n\n\n\n The attacker would need to be the receiver of the packet (that contains leaked data) or along the path (e.g., on a local network that doesn\u2019t use encryption).\n \n\n\n#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT is unaware of any exploits that target this vulnerability.\n \n\n\n#### DIFFICULTY\n\n\n\n An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability. This is a passive attack; the attacker can only access the data that are contained within the packet.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems division has already developed and deployed ProView 5\\.1 firmware that mitigates this vulnerability, and the Form 6 control version was released on June\u00a012, 2015\\. Idea/IdeaPLUS relay ProView software versions began to be posted on June\u00a030,\u00a02015\\. Information on how to obtain and install new firmware versions is available at:\n \n\n\n\n[http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/public/en/power\\_systems/resources/securitysupport.html](http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/public/en/power_systems/resources/securitysupport.html%20) \n\n\n\n\n Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems recommends that asset owners using these products take the proper steps to ensure systemwide defense\\-in\\-depth strategies, as outlined in Eaton\u2019s whitepaper WP152002EN. This whitepaper can be downloaded at:\n \n\n\n\n[http://www.eaton.com/ecm/idcplg?IdcService\\=GET\\_FILE\\&allowInterrupt\\=1\\&RevisionSelectionMethod\\=LatestReleased\\&Rendition\\=Primary\\&dDocName\\=WP152002EN](http://www.eaton.com/ecm/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&allowInterrupt=1&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&Rendition=Primary&dDocName=WP152002EN) \n\n\n\n\n For additional technical information, please contact Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Systems at:\n \n\n\n\n[www.eaton.com/cybersecurity](http://www.eaton.com/cybersecurity) \n\n\n\n\n A previous ICS\\-CERT advisory, ICSA\\-15\\-006\\-01 Eaton\u2019s Cooper Power Series Form 6 Control and Idea/IdeaPlus Relays with Ethernet Vulnerability,\n a \n recommends this same firmware version to mitigate a separate vulnerability.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site (\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Eaton\\&\\#039;s Cooper Power Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-15-295-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
