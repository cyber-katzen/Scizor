EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Electronics\nEquipment: DOPSoft 2\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-Bounds Write, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. UPDATED INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-252-02 Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2 that was published September 9, 2021, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.\n3.\u00a0RISK EVALUATION\u00a0\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow arbitrary code execution.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DOPSoft 2 are affected:\n\nDOPSoft 2: Version 2.00.07 and prior\n\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer during font string handling. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38402 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could result in multiple out-of-bounds write instances. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38406 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nThe affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could result in a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38404 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 ---------\nDOPSoft 2 will not receive an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities because it is an end-of-life product. Delta Electronics recommends users switch HMI devices to the DOP-100 family and then switch the software to DIAScreen in DIAStudio v1.1.2 (or later) (login required).\n--------- End Update A part 1 of 1 ---------\nDOPSoft 2 will not receive an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities because it is an end-of-life product. Delta Electronics recommends users to switch to the replacement software when available.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nOnly uses project files from trusted sources.\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
