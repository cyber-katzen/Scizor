EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Delta Electronics* **Equipment:**  DOPSoft 2* **Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-Bounds Write, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow2\\. UPDATED INFORMATION----------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-21\\-252\\-02 Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2 that was published September 9, 2021, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.3\\.\u00a0RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow arbitrary code execution.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of DOPSoft 2 are affected:* DOPSoft 2: Version 2\\.00\\.07 and prior### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could lead to a stack\\-based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer during font string handling. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-38402](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38402)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could result in multiple out\\-of\\-bounds write instances. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-38406](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38406)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.3 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) The affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing specific project files. This could result in a heap\\-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2021\\-38404](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38404)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Taiwan### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER kimiya, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS---------------**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  DOPSoft 2 will not receive an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities because it is an end\\-of\\-life product. Delta Electronics recommends users switch HMI devices to the DOP\\-100 family and then switch the software to [DIAScreen in DIAStudio v1\\.1\\.2 (or later) (login required)](https://diastudio.deltaww.com/home/downloads?sec=download#catalog)  .**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**  DOPSoft 2 will not receive an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities because it is an end\\-of\\-life product. Delta Electronics recommends users to switch to the replacement software when available. CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Only uses project files from trusted sources.* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
