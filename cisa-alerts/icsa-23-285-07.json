TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following products of Siemens, are affected:\n \n\n\n* RUGGEDCOM APE1808 with Nozomi Guardian / CMC: versions prior to V22\\.6\\.2\n\n\n### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A blind SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in the sorting parameter, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-22378](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22378) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS\\-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE\\-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An authenticated attacker with administrative access to the appliance can inject malicious JavaScript code inside the definition of a threat intelligence rule, that will later be executed by another legitimate user viewing the details of such a rule. An attacker may be able to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users. JavaScript injection was possible in the content for Yara rules, while limited HTML injection has been proven for packet and STYX rules. The injected code will be executed in the context of the authenticated victim's session.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-22843](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-22843) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A blind SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in the alerts\\_count component, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-23574](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23574) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Every subsequent application request will return an error. The whole application in rendered unusable until a console intervention.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-23903](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-23903) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.5\n [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**\n\n\n\n\n A partial denial\\-of\\-service vulnerability has been detected in the reports section, exploitable by a malicious authenticated user forcing a report to be saved with its name set as null. The reports section will be partially unavailable for all later attempts to use it, with the report list seemingly stuck on loading.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-24015](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-24015) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.6\n [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An access control vulnerability was found, due to the restrictions that are applied on actual assertions not being enforced in their debug functionality. An authenticated user with reduced visibility can obtain unauthorized information via the debug functionality, obtaining data that would normally be not accessible in the query and assertions functions.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-24471](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-24471) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.7\n [SESSION FIXATION CWE\\-384](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html)**\n\n\n\n\n In certain conditions, depending on timing and the usage of the Chrome web browser, Guardian/CMC versions before 22\\.6\\.2 do not always completely invalidate the user session upon logout, resulting in the opportunity for an authenticated local attacker to gain access to the original user's session.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2023\\-24477](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-24477) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
