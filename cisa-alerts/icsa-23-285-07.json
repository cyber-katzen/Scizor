EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: RUGGEDCOM APE1808\nVulnerabilities: SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting, Improper Input Validation, Incorrect Authorization, Session Fixation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries or injected code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nRUGGEDCOM APE1808 with Nozomi Guardian / CMC: versions prior to V22.6.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nA blind SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in the sorting parameter, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.\nCVE-2023-22378\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.2\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nAn authenticated attacker with administrative access to the appliance can inject malicious JavaScript code inside the definition of a threat intelligence rule, that will later be executed by another legitimate user viewing the details of such a rule. An attacker may be able to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users. JavaScript injection was possible in the content for Yara rules, while limited HTML injection has been proven for packet and STYX rules. The injected code will be executed in the context of the authenticated victim's session.\nCVE-2023-22843\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nA blind SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in the alerts_count component, allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the DBMS used by the web application. Authenticated users can extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way.\nCVE-2023-23574\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn authenticated administrator can upload a SAML configuration file with the wrong format, with the application not checking the correct file format. Every subsequent application request will return an error. The whole application in rendered unusable until a console intervention.\nCVE-2023-23903\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA partial denial-of-service vulnerability has been detected in the reports section, exploitable by a malicious authenticated user forcing a report to be saved with its name set as null. The reports section will be partially unavailable for all later attempts to use it, with the report list seemingly stuck on loading.\nCVE-2023-24015\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.6\u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\nAn access control vulnerability was found, due to the restrictions that are applied on actual assertions not being enforced in their debug functionality. An authenticated user with reduced visibility can obtain unauthorized information via the debug functionality, obtaining data that would normally be not accessible in the query and assertions functions.\nCVE-2023-24471\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.7\u00a0SESSION FIXATION CWE-384\nIn certain conditions, depending on timing and the usage of the Chrome web browser, Guardian/CMC versions before 22.6.2 do not always completely invalidate the user session upon logout, resulting in the opportunity for an authenticated local attacker to gain access to the original user's session.\nCVE-2023-24477\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens ProductCERT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nUse internal firewall features to limit access to the web management interface.\nAdopt best practices that include closing the browser after a logout.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-647455 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
