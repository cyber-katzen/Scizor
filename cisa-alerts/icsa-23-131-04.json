For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see\u00a0Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.2\u00a0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Siemens\nEquipment:\u00a0SIMATIC Cloud Connect 7\nVulnerabilities:\u00a0Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'), Use of Hard-coded Password, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products from Siemens are affected:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC712 (6GK1411-1AC00): All versions V2.0 to V2.1\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC712 (6GK1411-1AC00): All versions prior to V2.1\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC716 (6GK1411-5AC00): All versions V2.0 to V2.1\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC716 (6GK1411-5AC00): All versions prior to V2.1\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN A COMMAND ('COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-77\u00a0\nThe web-based management of affected devices does not properly validate user input, making it susceptible to command injection. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-28832 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\u00a0\nThe affected device uses a hard-coded password to protect the diagnostic files. This could allow an authenticated attacker to access protected data.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29103 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nThe filename in the upload feature of the web-based management of the affected device is susceptible to a path traversal vulnerability. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to overwrite any file the Linux user `ccuser` has write access to, or to download any file the Linux user `ccuser` has read-only access to.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29104 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.0 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0MISSING STANDARDIZED ERROR HANDLING MECHANISM CWE-544\u00a0\nThe affected device is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition while parsing a random (non-JSON) MQTT payload. This could allow an attacker who can manipulate the communication between the MQTT broker and the affected device to cause a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29105 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\u00a0\nThe export endpoint is accessible via REST application programming interface (API) without authentication. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to download the files available via the endpoint.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29106 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0FILES OR DIRECTORIES ACCESSIBLE TO EXTERNAL PARTIES CWE-552\u00a0\nThe export endpoint discloses some undocumented files. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access to additional information resources.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29107 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nThe filename in the upload feature of the web-based management of the affected device is susceptible to a path traversal vulnerability. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to write any file with the extension `.db`.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-29128 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.8 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\u00a0\n\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC712 (6GK1411-1AC00): Update to V2.1 or later\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC712 (6GK1411-1AC00): Update to V2.1 or later\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC716 (6GK1411-5AC00): Update to V2.1 or later\nSIMATIC Cloud Connect 7 CC716 (6GK1411-5AC00): Update to V2.1 or later\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\u00a0\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\u00a0\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products, users should contact the Siemens ProductCERT.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-555292 in HTML and CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\u00a0\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\u00a0\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\u00a0\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\u00a0\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\n",
