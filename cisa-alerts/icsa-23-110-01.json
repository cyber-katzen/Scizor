EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 10.0\nATTENTION:\u00a0Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0INEA\nEquipment:\u00a0ME RTU\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0OS Command Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote code execution.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of ME RTU, a remote terminal unit, are affected:\u00a0\n\nME RTU: versions prior to 3.36\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\u00a0\nVersions of INEA ME RTU firmware prior to 3.36 are vulnerable to operating system (OS) command injection, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-2131\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Energy, Water and Wastewater, Transportation\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nFloris Hendriks of Radboud University reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nINEA has developed mitigations for this vulnerability and recommends users update to the latest firmware version:\u00a0\n\nME RTU: Update to\u00a0version 3.36\u00a0or later.\u00a0\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
