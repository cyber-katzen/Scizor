EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC Controller Web Servers\nVulnerability: Uncaught Exception\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the vulnerability affects the web server of the following SIMATIC controllers:\n\nSIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller (incl. SIPLUS variants): Version 20.8\nSIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller: Version 20.8\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION CWE-248\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the products web server, which may cause a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2020-15796 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends updating to the latest version:\n\nSIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller (incl.
