EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Uffizio\nEquipment: GPS Tracker\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Open Redirect, Cross-site Scripting, Cross-site Request Forgery\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker with access to the host to view sensitive information, gain code execution, cause a redirection to an arbitrary external domain, and perform actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\nAll versions of GPS Tracker software\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nVisiting through the browser or doing curl on the vulnerable host at Port 9000 responds with JSON body, revealing information about deployed GPS devices.\nCVE-2020-17483 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThe web server can be compromised by uploading and executing a web/reverse shell. An attacker could then run commands, browse system files, and browse local resources.\nCVE-2020-17485 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601\nAn attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain.\nCVE-2020-17484 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nAn attacker may be able to inject client-side JavaScript code on multiple instances within the application.\nCVE-2021-32927 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY CWE-352\nThis application-wide vulnerability may allow an attacker to perform unintended actions on behalf of a user.\nCVE-2021-32929 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Transportation Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: India\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHarshit Shukla reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nUffizio is aware of these vulnerabilities and has not supplied any mitigations or workarounds. Contact Uffizio for more information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
