Rockwell Automation has produced patches that mitigate these vulnerabilities, and released the patches April 5, 2013. Rockwell Automation has tested the patches to validate that they resolve the vulnerabilities.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 --------\nCarsten Eiram discovered additional vulnerabilities after the patches were released in April, and Rockwell released new patches that mitigate the additional vulnerabilities on June 28, 2013.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 4 ----------\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following FactoryTalk Services Platform and RSLinx Enterprise product versions are affected:\n\nCPR9,\nCPR9-SR1,\nCPR9-SR2,\nCPR9-SR3,\nCPR9-SR4,\nCPR9-SR5,\nCPR9-SR5.1, and\nCPR9-SR6.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in a DoS condition to the services, service termination, and the potential for code injection.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\u00a0\nBACKGROUND\nRockwell Automation provides industrial automation control and information products worldwide, across a wide range of industries.\nFactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP) shares data throughout a distributed system and enforces redundancy and fault tolerance while tracking changes in the system.\nRSLinx Enterprise is used for design and configuration, which provides plant-floor device connectivity for multiple Rockwell software applications. This software also has open interfaces for third-party human-machine interfaces (HMIs), data collection and analysis packages, as well as custom client-applications.\nAccording to Rockwell Automation, both products are deployed across several sectors including agriculture and food, water, chemical, manufacturing, and others. The Rockwell product Web site states that these products are used in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe, as well as the United States, Korea, China, Japan, and Latin American countries.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINTEGER OVERFLOW\u2013NEGATIVE INTEGERCWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html, Web site last accessed April 05, 2013.\n\nThe FactoryTalk Services Platform (RNADiagnostics.dll) does not validate input correctly and cannot allocate a negative integer. By sending a negative integer input to the service over Port 4445/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections. An attacker could possibly cause the RNADiagnostics.dll or RNADiagReceiver.exe service to terminate.\nCVE-2012-4713NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4713 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\n\nINTEGER OVERFLOW\u2013OVERSIZED INTEGERa\n\nThe FactoryTalk Services Platform (RNADiagnostics.dll) does not handle input correctly and cannot allocate an over-sized integer. By sending an over-sized integer input to the service over Port 4445/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections. An attacker could possibly cause the service to terminate.\nCVE-2012-4714NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4714 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 4 --------\n\nIMPROPER EXCEPTION HANDLINGCWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html, Web site last accessed April 05, 2013.\n\nThe RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe and Logger.dll) does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it receives a zero or large byte datagram. If an attacker sends a datagram of zero byte size to the receiver over Port 4444/UDP (user-configurable, not enabled by default), the attacker would cause a DoS condition where the service silently ignores further incoming requests.\nAfter discussion with the researcher and vendor, this vulnerability was a duplicate of CVE-2012-4715, and therefore the two vulnerabilities have been combined. CVE-2012-4715 will be retracted from the NVD Web site.\nCVE-2012-4695NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4695, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 4 ----------\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 4 --------\n\nOUT-OF-BOUNDS READCWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\nThe RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it receives a datagram with an incorrect value in the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to an oversized value, an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.\nCVE-2013-2805NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2805 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\nINTEGER OVERFLOWCWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\nThe RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the \u201cTotal Record Size\u201d field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the \u201cTotal Record Size\u201d that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.\nCVE-2013-2807NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2807 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\nINTEGER OVERFLOWCWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n\nThe RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the \u201cEnd of Current Record\u201d field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the \u201cTotal Record Size.\u201d Then the service will calculate an incorrect value for the \u201cEnd of Current Record\u201d field causing access violations that lead to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.\nCVE-2013-2806NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2806 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013.\n--------- End Update A Part 4 of 4 ----------\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nRockwell Automation\u2019s recommendation to asset owners using FTSP or RSLinx CPR9 through CPR9-SR4 is to upgrade to CPR9-SR5 or newer. Rockwell Automation also recommends that all asset owners using FTSP or RSLinx CPR9-SR5 and newer should apply the correlating patch for the version they are using.\nThe patches and details pertaining to these vulnerabilities can be found at the following Rockwell Automation Security Advisory link (login is required):\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/537599\nIn addition, asset owners can find security information for other Rockwell Automation products at the Security Advisory Index page link below (login is required):\nhttps://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/54102\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,\u00a0which is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
