Rockwell Automation has produced patches that mitigate these vulnerabilities, and released the patches April 5, 2013\\. Rockwell Automation has tested the patches to validate that they resolve the vulnerabilities.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Carsten Eiram discovered additional vulnerabilities after the patches were released in April, and Rockwell released new patches that mitigate the additional vulnerabilities on June 28, 2013\\.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.### AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following FactoryTalk Services Platform and RSLinx Enterprise product versions are affected:* CPR9,* CPR9\\-SR1,* CPR9\\-SR2,* CPR9\\-SR3,* CPR9\\-SR4,* CPR9\\-SR5,* CPR9\\-SR5\\.1, and* CPR9\\-SR6\\.### IMPACT Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in a DoS condition to the services, service termination, and the potential for code injection. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.### BACKGROUND Rockwell Automation provides industrial automation control and information products worldwide, across a wide range of industries. FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP) shares data throughout a distributed system and enforces redundancy and fault tolerance while tracking changes in the system. RSLinx Enterprise is used for design and configuration, which provides plant\\-floor device connectivity for multiple Rockwell software applications. This software also has open interfaces for third\\-party human\\-machine interfaces (HMIs), data collection and analysis packages, as well as custom client\\-applications. According to Rockwell Automation, both products are deployed across several sectors including agriculture and food, water, chemical, manufacturing, and others. The Rockwell product Web site states that these products are used in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe, as well as the United States, Korea, China, Japan, and Latin American countries.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### INTEGER OVERFLOW\u2013NEGATIVE INTEGERCWE\\-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190\\.html, Web site last accessed April 05, 2013\\. The FactoryTalk Services Platform (RNADiagnostics.dll) does not validate input correctly and cannot allocate a negative integer. By sending a negative integer input to the service over Port 4445/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections. An attacker could possibly cause the RNADiagnostics.dll or RNADiagReceiver.exe service to terminate. CVE\\-2012\\-4713NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4713 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013\\.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013\\.#### INTEGER OVERFLOW\u2013OVERSIZED INTEGER a The FactoryTalk Services Platform (RNADiagnostics.dll) does not handle input correctly and cannot allocate an over\\-sized integer. By sending an over\\-sized integer input to the service over Port 4445/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections. An attacker could possibly cause the service to terminate. CVE\\-2012\\-4714NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4714 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013\\.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed October 07, 2013\\.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 3 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**#### IMPROPER EXCEPTION HANDLINGCWE\\-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703\\.html, Web site last accessed April 05, 2013\\. The RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe and Logger.dll) does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it receives a zero or large byte datagram. If an attacker sends a datagram of zero byte size to the receiver over Port 4444/UDP (user\\-configurable, not enabled by default), the attacker would cause a DoS condition where the service silently ignores further incoming requests. After discussion with the researcher and vendor, this vulnerability was a duplicate of CVE\\-2012\\-4715, and therefore the two vulnerabilities have been combined. CVE\\-2012\\-4715 will be retracted from the NVD Web site. CVE\\-2012\\-4695NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4695, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report.
