Rockwell Automation has produced patches that mitigate these vulnerabilities, and released the patches April 5, 2013\\. Rockwell Automation has tested the patches to validate that they resolve the vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n Carsten Eiram discovered additional vulnerabilities after the patches were released in April, and Rockwell released new patches that mitigate the additional vulnerabilities on June 28, 2013\\.\n \n\n\n### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 2 of 4 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\n### AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following FactoryTalk Services Platform and RSLinx Enterprise product versions are affected:\n \n\n\n* CPR9,\n* CPR9\\-SR1,\n* CPR9\\-SR2,\n* CPR9\\-SR3,\n* CPR9\\-SR4,\n* CPR9\\-SR5,\n* CPR9\\-SR5\\.1, and\n* CPR9\\-SR6\\.\n\n\n### IMPACT\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in a DoS condition to the services, service termination, and the potential for code injection.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\n### BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n Rockwell Automation provides industrial automation control and information products worldwide, across a wide range of industries.\n \n\n\n\n FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP) shares data throughout a distributed system and enforces redundancy and fault tolerance while tracking changes in the system.\n \n\n\n\n RSLinx Enterprise is used for design and configuration, which provides plant\\-floor device connectivity for multiple Rockwell software applications. This software also has open interfaces for third\\-party human\\-machine interfaces (HMIs), data collection and analysis packages, as well as custom client\\-applications.\n \n\n\n\n According to Rockwell Automation, both products are deployed across several sectors including agriculture and food, water, chemical, manufacturing, and others. The Rockwell product Web site states that these products are used in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe, as well as the United States, Korea, China, Japan, and Latin American countries.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n#### INTEGER OVERFLOW\u2013NEGATIVE INTEGERCWE\\-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190\\.html, Web site last accessed April 05, 2013\\.\n\n\n\n\n The FactoryTalk Services Platform (RNADiagnostics.dll) does not validate input correctly and cannot allocate a negative integer. By sending a negative integer input to the service over Port 4445/UDP, an attacker could cause a DoS condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections. An attacker could possibly cause the RNADiagnostics.dll or RNADiagReceiver.exe service to terminate.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2012\\-4713NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4713 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. Web site last accessed October 07, 2013\\.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability.

If an attacker sends a datagram of zero byte size to the receiver over Port 4444/UDP (user\\-configurable, not enabled by default), the attacker would cause a DoS condition where the service silently ignores further incoming requests.\n \n\n\n\n After discussion with the researcher and vendor, this vulnerability was a duplicate of CVE\\-2012\\-4715, and therefore the two vulnerabilities have been combined. CVE\\-2012\\-4715 will be retracted from the NVD Web site.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2012\\-4695NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2012\\-4695, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report.

Rockwell Automation also recommends that all asset owners using FTSP or RSLinx CPR9\\-SR5 and newer should apply the correlating patch for the version they are using.\n \n\n\n\n The patches and details pertaining to these vulnerabilities can be found at the following Rockwell Automation Security Advisory link (login is required):\n \n\n\n\n<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/537599>\n\n\n\n\n In addition, asset owners can find security information for other Rockwell Automation products at the Security Advisory Index page link below (login is required):\n \n\n\n\n<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/54102>\n\n\n\n\n ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\n [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n ,\u00a0which is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT Web site (\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Rockwell Automation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-13-095-02a) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
