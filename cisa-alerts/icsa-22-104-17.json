RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to extract information from a database protected field.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Mendix, a software platform to build mobile and web applications, are affected:\n\nMendix applications using Mendix 7: All versions prior to 7.23.27\nMendix applications using Mendix 8: All versions prior to 8.18.14\nMendix applications using Mendix 9: All versions prior to 9.12.0\nMendix applications using Mendix 9 (9.6): All versions prior to 9.6.3\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284\nThe affected product is vulnerable when querying the database as it is possible to sort the results using a protected field. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to extract information.\nCVE-2022-25650 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has provided the following specific workarounds and mitigations:\n\nUpdate Mendix Project to Version 7.23.27 or later\nUpdate Mendix Project to Version 8.18.14 or later\nUpdate Mendix Project to Version 9.12.0 or later\nUpdate Mendix Project to Version 9.6.3 or later (preferably to the latest version 9.12)\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-870917\n\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
