[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGeutebruck IP Cameras===================== Last Revised March 20, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-079\\-01### **CVSS v3 9\\.8****ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Geutebr\u00fcck**Equipment:**  IP Cameras**Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Authentication, SQL Injection, Cross\\-Site Request Forgery, Improper Access Control, Server\\-Side Request Forgery, Cross\\-site ScriptingAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Geutebr\u00fcck reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following IP cameras:* G\\-Cam/EFD\\-2250 (part n\u00b0 5\\.02024\\) firmware version 1\\.12\\.0\\.4, and* Topline TopFD\\-2125 (part n\u00b0 5\\.02820\\)\u00a0 firmware version 3\\.15\\.1IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to proxy network scans, access to a database, adding an unauthorized user to the system, full configuration download including passwords, and remote code execution.MITIGATION---------- Geutebr\u00fcck recommends G\\-Cam/EFD\\-2250 users download and update to the newest firmware version, 1\\.12\\.0\\.19, by registering for a new WebClub account, or by logging into an existing account at the following location:[https://www.geutebrueck.com//en\\_EN/login.html](https://www.geutebrueck.com/en_EN/login.html)  Topline users can visit the previous link for workaround advice and contact information regarding the vulnerabilities associated with the device. NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT website](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unauthentication vulnerabilities have been identified, which may allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-7532](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7532)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
