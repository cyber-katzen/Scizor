EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SINUMERIK Integrate Operate Client\nVulnerability: Improper Certificate Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to spoof any SSL server certificate and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SINUMERIK are affected:\n\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyCondition: All versions\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance: All versions\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance / OEE-Monitor: All versions\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance / OEE-Tuning: All versions\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 02: All versions including v02.00.12 and up to but not including v02.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 03: All versions between v03.00.12 and up to but not including v03.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 04: Version v04.00.02 and all versions including v04.00.15 up to but not including v04.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate for Production 4.1: All versions prior to v4.1 SP10 HF3\nSINUMERIK Integrate for Production 5.1: Version 5.1\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines / Remote: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines / Spindel Monitor: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage MyPrograms: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage MyResources / Programs: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage MyResources / Tools: All versions\nSINUMERIK Manage My Tools: All versions\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.8: All versions prior to v4.8 SP8\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.93: All versions prior to v4.93 HF7\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.94: All versions prior to v4.94 HF5\nSINUMERIK Optimize MyProgramming / NX-Cam Editor: All versions\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nDue to an error in a third-party dependency, the SSL flags used for setting up a TLS connection to a server are overwritten with wrong settings. This results in a missing validation of the server certificate and thus results in a possible TLS MITM scenario.\nCVE-2021-31892 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has provided remediations for the following affected products. Contact the Siemens representative for information on how to obtain the following updates:\n\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyCondition: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance / OEE-Monitor: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Analyze MyPerformance / OEE-Tuning: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 02: Update to v02.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 03: Update to v03.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate Client 04: Update to v04.00.18\nSINUMERIK Integrate for Production 4.1: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Integrate for Production 5.1: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines / Remote: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyMachines / Spindel Monitor: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyPrograms: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyResources / Programs: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage MyResources / Tools: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Manage My Tools: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.8: Update SINUMERIK Operate to v4.8 SP8 or update included SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.93: Update SINUMERIK Operate to v4.93 HF7 or update included SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Operate v4.94: Update SINUMERIK Operate to v4.94 HF5 or update included SINUMERIK Integrate Client\nSINUMERIK Optimize MyProgramming / NX-Cam Editor: Update SINUMERIK Integrate Client\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on Industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information about this vulnerability and the associated remediations, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-729965.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability has a high attack complexity.\n",
