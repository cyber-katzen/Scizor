MITIGATIONS--------------- Mitsubishi Electric recommends users update software to the latest versions below. Users will need to [contact a Mitsubishi representative](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/support/index.html)  to obtain the updates:* MELSOFT GT OPC UA Client: Update to 1\\.03D or later* GT SoftGOT2000: Update to 1\\.275M or later Mitsubishi Electric recommends users take the following mitigations to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:* When connecting the products to the Internet, use a virtual private network (VPN, etc.) to prevent spoofing and sniffing.* Use the products within the LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts.* Update the OPC UA server to the latest version.* Install antivirus software.* Restrict physical access to computers and network equipment that use the affected products. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
