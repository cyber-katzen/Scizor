Schneider Electric has released a security notification with instructions to mitigate this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSchneider Electric reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of Unity PRO:\n\nUnity PRO, all versions prior to V11.1\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker who misleads a valid user into loading a specially crafted malicious file into Unity Simulator could remotely execute arbitrary code.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and it maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe affected product, Unity PRO, is development software used to test, debug, and manage applications. According to Schneider Electric, Unity PRO is deployed across most sectors including Commercial Facilities and Energy. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENT CONTROL FLOW MANAGEMENTCWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/691.html, web site last accessed November 01, 2016.\n\nUnity projects can be compiled as x86 instructions and loaded onto the PLC Simulator delivered with Unity PRO. These x86 instructions are subsequently executed directly by the simulator. A specially crafted patched Unity project file can make the simulator execute malicious code by redirecting the control flow of these instructions.\nCVE-2016-8354NVD, https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-8354 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, web site last accessed November 01, 2016.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nDetailed vulnerability information is publicly available that could be used to develop an exploit that targets this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nCrafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the patched program file. Additional user interaction is needed to load the malformed file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\nMITIGATION\nThis vulnerability is made possible when no application program has been loaded in the simulator or when the application program loaded in the simulator is not password protected.\nSchneider Electric recommends the following mitigation practices:\n\nUpgrade to Unity PRO Version 11.1. By default, it is not possible to launch this version of the simulator without any Unity PRO application associated.\nExercise caution in selecting which project files are executed by the simulator. Do not trust files that come from unknown or untrusted sources.\nUse strong passwords to protect applications. It is not possible to load or to modify this application without being authenticated once the password protected application has been loaded onto the simulator.\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Schneider Electric security notification SEVD-2016-288-01 at the following location:\nhttp://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2016-288-01\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
