[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryRockwell Automation ControlLogix and GuardLogix=============================================== Release Date January 30, 2024 Alert Code ICSA\\-24\\-030\\-05**[View CSAF](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)**1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3**  8\\.6* **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Rockwell Automation* **Equipment**  : ControlLogix, GuardLogix* **Vulnerability**  : Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the device by exploiting a Denial\\-of\\-Service (DoS) vulnerability.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and GuardLogix programmable logic controllers are affected:* ControlLogix 5570: Firmware version 20\\.011* ControlLogix 5570 Redundancy: Firmware versions 20\\.054\\_kit1* GuardLogix 5570: Firmware version 20\\.011### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE\\-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)** A Denial\\-of\\-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists that, if exploited, the product could potentially experience a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF).\u00a0The device will restart itself to recover from the MNRF.[CVE\\-2024 21916](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21916)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 8\\.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Rockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Rockwell Automation users with the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations, if possible. Additionally, Rockwell Automation encourages users to implement their suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability.* ControlLogix 5570: Corrected in v33\\.016, 34\\.013, 35\\.012, 36\\.011 and later* ControlLogix 5570 Redundancy: Corrected in v33\\.053\\_kit1, 34\\.052\\_kit1, 35\\.052\\_kit1, 36\\.051\\_kit1 and later* GuardLogix 5570: Corrected in v33\\.016, 34\\.013, 35\\.012, 36\\.011 and later For more information, see Rockwell Automation's [security advisory](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/company/about-us/sustainability/trust-security/security-advisories.html)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.5\\.
