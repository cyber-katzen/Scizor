EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 6.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Hitachi Energy\nEquipment: Asset Suite 9\nVulnerability: Improper Authentication\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to use an authentication anomaly to successfully invoke the REST service.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Hitachi Energy's Asset Suite, an enterprise asset management tool, are affected:\n\nAsset Suite: Versions prior to 9.6.3.13\nAsset Suite: Versions prior to 9.6.4.1\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nREST service authentication anomaly with \"valid username/no password\" credential combination for batch job processing may result in successful service invocation. The anomaly doesn't exist with other credential combinations.\nCVE-2024-2244 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-2244. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Switzerland\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nHitachi Energy reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHitachi Energy recommends users apply the following mitigations where available:\n\nUpdate to version 9.6.3.13 or 9.6.4.1\n\nFor more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory 8DBD000195.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
