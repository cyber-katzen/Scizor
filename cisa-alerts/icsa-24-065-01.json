MITIGATIONS--------------- Nice/Nortek encourages users to upgrade to the latest firmware to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities. Please see [Nice's E3\\-Bulletin](https://linear-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/E3-Bulletin-06-27-2023.pdf)  for more information. Nice also recommends the following defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities:* Minimize network exposure of devices, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.* Place the devices behind firewalls and isolate them from other networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Keep your VPNs as updated as possible.* Change default credentials on the device.* Change the default IP address of the device. See [Nice's Telephone Entry Bulletin](https://linear-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/Service-Bulletin-for-Telephone-Entry-Products-04-12-2023.pdf)  for additional information. Users should contact [Nice](https://na.niceforyou.com/about/contact/)  with any questions. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
