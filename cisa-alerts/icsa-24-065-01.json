A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND (\u2018OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nNice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior are vulnerable to OS command injection, which could allow an attacker to cause remote code execution.\nCVE-2019-7256\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nNice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior are vulnerable to unrestricted upload of malicious files, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-7257\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\nNice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior suffer from an authorization mechanism vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and gain full control of the system.\nCVE-2019-7258\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nAn authorization bypass occurs in Nice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior when an authenticated attacker visits a specific GET request against the target, resulting in disclosure of administrative credentials in clear-text. This allows the attacker to re-login with admin privileges and have full access to the control interface.\nCVE-2019-7259\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.8\u00a0INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522\nThe application of Nice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior stores passwords in clear-text in its DBMS system. Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\nCVE-2019-7260\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.9\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nHard-coded credentials are present in multiple binaries bundled in the Nice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior firmware OS. These hard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication configured by the software administrator.\nCVE-2019-7261\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.10\u00a0USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\nThe Nice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior access control platform has SSH enabled with hardcoded credentials for the root account. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to initiate a secure connection with highest privileges (root) and gain full system access.\nCVE-2019-7265\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.11\u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe application of Nice Linear eMerge E3-Series versions 1.00-06 and prior allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests.

A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Italy\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nGjoko Krstic from Zero Science Lab reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nNice/Nortek encourages users to upgrade to the latest firmware to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities. Please see\u00a0Nice's E3-Bulletin\u00a0for more information.\nNice also recommends the following defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities:\n\nMinimize network exposure of devices, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nPlace the devices behind firewalls and isolate them from other networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Keep your VPNs as updated as possible.\nChange default credentials on the device.\nChange the default IP address of the device.\n\nSee\u00a0Nice's Telephone Entry Bulletin\u00a0for additional information.\nUsers should contact\u00a0Nice\u00a0with any questions.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n5.
