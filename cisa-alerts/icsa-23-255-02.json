EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3\u00a05.9\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\nVendor:\u00a0Fujitsu Software\nEquipment:\u00a0Infrastructure Manager\nVulnerability:\u00a0Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker retrieving the password for the proxy server that is configured in ISM from the maintenance data.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Infrastructure Manager are affected:\n\nInfrastructure Manager: Advanced Edition V2.8.0.060\nInfrastructure Manager: Advanced Edition for PRIMEFLEX V2.8.0.060\nInfrastructure Manager: Essential Edition V2.8.0.060\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information CWE-312\nAn issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection), or regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware repository site, as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the associated ismsnap maintenance data, in the same manner as a trusted party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and configured, and that the character \\ (backslash) is used in a user credential (i.e., user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server.\nCVE-2023-39903\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nFujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH and the Fujitsu PSIRT (Europe) reported the vulnerability to MITRE and Fujitsu Limited. Fujitsu Limited and JPCERT/CC reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFujitsu Software recommends updating the software to version\u00a0V2.8.0.061, which has been released to fix this vulnerability.\nFujitsu Software recommends, as a workaround, using a user ID and/or a password for the proxy server not including \"\\\" (backslash) character, when downloading firmware.\nFujitsu Software recommends, as a workaround, storing the maintenance data in a trusted location, and deleting when unnecessary.\nJPCERT/CC published\u00a0JVN#38847224\u00a0regarding this issue.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nSeptember 12, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
