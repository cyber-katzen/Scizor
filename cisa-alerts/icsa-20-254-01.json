EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.6\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: Enterprise Data Management Web\nVulnerability: SQL Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the affected device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Enterprise Data Management Web (formerly eDNA Web), a data management platform, are affected:\n\nEnterprise Data Management Web v2019 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89\nThe affected product is vulnerable to SQL injection, which may allow a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands under the privileges of the account configured in eDNA Web for SQL access. If eDNA Web is not installed, the deployment is not vulnerable.\nCVE-2020-13499, CVE-2020-13500, and CVE-2020-13501 have been assigned to this vulnerability.\nA CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been assigned for versions prior to 2017; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\nA CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been assigned for versions 2017-2019; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nYuri Kramarz of Cisco Talos reported this vulnerability to AVEVA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA reports that affected users are recommended to upgrade to AVEVA Enterprise Data Management Web v2019 SP1 as soon as possible. If an upgrade to v2019 SP1 is not possible, users can contact AVEVA Global Customer Support, and a hot-fix can be made available for eDNA Web v2018 SP2. Other versions will not be hot-fixed and must be upgraded. For help with applying upgrades and hot-fixes, please contact AVEVA Global Customer Support.\nFor more information see the AVEVA security bulletin here.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
