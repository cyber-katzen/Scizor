EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: FATEK Automation\nEquipment: FvDesigner\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Write, Out-of-bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of FvDesigner, a software tool used to design and develop FATEK FV HMI series product projects, are affected:\n\nFvDesigner: Versions 1.5.100 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2022-25170 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write while processing project files, which allows an attacker to craft a project file that would allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2022-23985 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read while processing project files, which allows an attacker to craft a project file that would allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2022-21209 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nKhangkito of VinCSS and xina1i, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFATEK has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of these affected products are invited to contact FATEK customer support for additional information.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
