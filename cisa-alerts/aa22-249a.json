These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.\nActions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from ransomware:\u2022 Prioritize and remediate\u00a0known exploited vulnerabilities.\u2022 Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.\u2022 Enable and enforce multifactor authentication.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate IOCs and TTPs associated with Vice Society actors identified through FBI investigations as recently as September 2022. The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC have recently observed Vice Society actors disproportionately targeting the education sector with ransomware attacks.\nOver the past several years, the education sector, especially kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) institutions, have been a frequent target of ransomware attacks. Impacts from these attacks have ranged from restricted access to networks and data, delayed exams, canceled school days, and unauthorized access to and theft of personal information regarding students and staff. The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC anticipate attacks may increase as the 2022/2023 school year begins and criminal ransomware groups perceive opportunities for successful attacks. School districts with limited cybersecurity capabilities and constrained resources are often the most vulnerable; however, the opportunistic targeting often seen with cyber criminals can still put school districts with robust cybersecurity programs at risk. K-12 institutions may be seen as particularly lucrative targets due to the amount of\u00a0sensitive student data\u00a0accessible through school systems or their managed service providers.\nThe FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\u00a0pdf, 521 KB\nDownload the IOCs:\u00a0.stix 31 kb\nTechnical Details\n\nNote:\u00a0This advisory uses the\u00a0MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae\u00a0for Enterprise\u00a0framework, version 11. See\u00a0MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise\u00a0for all referenced tactics and techniques.\nVice Society is an intrusion, exfiltration, and extortion hacking group that first appeared in summer 2021. Vice Society actors do not use a ransomware variant of unique origin. Instead, the actors have deployed versions of\u00a0Hello Kitty/Five Hands\u00a0and\u00a0Zeppelin ransomware, but may deploy other variants in the future.\nVice Society actors likely obtain initial network access through compromised credentials by exploiting internet-facing applications [T1190]. Prior to deploying ransomware, the actors spend time exploring the network, identifying opportunities to increase accesses, and exfiltrating data [TA0010] for double extortion--a tactic whereby actors threaten to publicly release sensitive data unless a victim pays a ransom. Vice Society actors have been observed using a variety of tools, including SystemBC, PowerShell Empire, and Cobalt Strike to move laterally. They have also used \u201cliving off the land\u201d techniques targeting the legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service [T1047] and tainting shared content [T1080].\nVice Society actors have been observed exploiting the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675\u00a0and\u00a0CVE-2021-34527\u00a0) to escalate privileges [T1068]. To maintain persistence, the criminal actors have been observed leveraging scheduled tasks [T1053], creating undocumented autostart Registry keys [T1547.001], and pointing legitimate services to their custom malicious dynamic link libraries (DLLs) through a tactic known as DLL side-loading [T1574.002]. Vice Society actors attempt to evade detection through masquerading their malware and tools as legitimate files [T1036], using process injection [T1055], and likely use evasion techniques to defeat automated dynamic analysis [T1497]. Vice Society actors have been observed escalating privileges, then gaining access to domain administrator accounts, and running scripts to change the passwords of victims\u2019 network accounts to prevent the victim from remediating.\u00a0\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n\nEmail Addresses\n\n\nv-society.official@onionmail[.]org\n\n\nViceSociety@onionmail[.]org\n\n\nOnionMail email accounts in the format of [First Name][Last Name]@onionmail[.]org\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTOR Address\n\n\nhttp://vsociethok6sbprvevl4dlwbqrzyhxcxaqpvcqt5belwvsuxaxsutyad[.]onion\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIP Addresses for C2\nConfidence Level\n\n\n5.255.99[.]59\nHigh Confidence\n\n\n5.161.136[.]176\nMedium Confidence\n\n\n198.252.98[.]184\nMedium Confidence\n\n\n194.34.246[.]90\nLow Confidence\n\n\n\nSee Table 1 for file hashes obtained from FBI incident response investigations in September 2022.\nTable 1: File Hashes as of September 2022\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA1\n\n\nfb91e471cfa246beb9618e1689f1ae1d\na0ee0761602470e24bcea5f403e8d1e8bfa29832\n\n\n\u00a0\n3122ea585623531df2e860e7d0df0f25cce39b21\n\n\n\u00a0\n41dc0ba220f30c70aea019de214eccd650bc6f37\n\n\n\u00a0\nc9c2b6a5b930392b98f132f5395d54947391cb79\n\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES\nVice Society actors have used ATT&CK techniques, similar to Zeppelin techniques, listed in Table 2.\nTable 2: Vice Society Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise\n\n\n\nInitial Access\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application\nT1190\nVice Society actors exploit vulnerabilities in an internet-facing systems to gain access to victims\u2019 networks.\n\n\nValid Accounts\nT1078\nVice Society actors obtain initial network access through compromised valid accounts.\n\n\nExecution\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nT1047\nVice Society actors leverage WMI as a means of \u201cliving off the land\u201d to execute malicious commands. WMI is a native Windows administration feature.\n\n\nScheduled Task/Job\nT1053\nVice Society have used malicious files that create component task schedule objects, which are often mean to register a specific task to autostart on system boot.

The location and contact information for FBI Field Offices and CISA Regional Offices can be located at\u00a0www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\u00a0and\u00a0www.cisa.gov/cisa-regions, respectively. Through these partnerships, the FBI and CISA can assist with identifying vulnerabilities to academia and mitigating potential threat activity. The FBI and CISA further recommend that academic entities review and, if needed, update incident response and communication plans that list actions an organization will take if impacted by a cyber incident.\nThe FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Vice Society actors:\nPreparing for Cyber Incidents\n\nMaintain offline backups of data,\u00a0and regularly maintain backup and restoration. \u00a0By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable\u00a0(i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure. Ensure your backup data is not already infected.\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your organization.\u00a0Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programs\u00a0under an established security policy.\nDocument and monitor external remote connections.\u00a0Organizations should document approved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.\nImplement a recovery plan\u00a0to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n\nRequire all accounts\u00a0with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts)\u00a0to comply\u00a0with\u00a0National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards\u00a0for developing and managing password policies.\n\nUse longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;\nStore passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;\nAdd password user \u201csalts\u201d to shared login credentials;\nAvoid reusing passwords;\nImplement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;\nDisable password \u201chints\u201d;\nRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a password is known or suspected to be compromised.Note:\u00a0NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password \u201cpatterns\u201d cyber criminals can easily decipher.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\n\nRequire phishing-resistant multifactor authentication\u00a0for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories\u00a0for new and/or unrecognized accounts.\nAudit user accounts\u00a0with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.\u00a0\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.\u00a0For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n\nSegment networks\u00a0to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between\u2014and access to\u2014various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.\u00a0To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\nInstall, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software\u00a0on all hosts.\nSecure and closely monitor\u00a0remote desktop protocol (RDP) use.\n\nLimit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. If RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.\n\n\n\nVulnerability and Configuration Management\n\nKeep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.\u00a0Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Organizations should prioritize patching of vulnerabilities on CISA\u2019s\u00a0Known Exploited Vulnerabilities\u00a0catalog.\nDisable unused\u00a0ports.\nConsider adding an email banner to emails\u00a0received from outside your organization.\nDisable hyperlinks\u00a0in received emails.\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.\u00a0Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.\nEnsure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled.\nDisable ports and protocols that are not being used\u00a0for a business purpose (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\nRestrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that are necessary, and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB\u00a0(i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nStopransomware.gov\u00a0is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\nResource to mitigate a ransomware attack:\u00a0CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nNo-cost cyber hygiene services:\u00a0Cyber Hygiene Services\u00a0and\u00a0Ransomware Readiness Assessment.\n\nREPORTING\nThe FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Vice Society actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\nThe FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC strongly discourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a\u00a0local FBI Field Office, or to CISA at\u00a0report@cisa.gov\u00a0or 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472.
