MITIGATIONS--------------- MSM is not intrinsically designed nor intended to be directly connected to the internet. Users should disconnect the device from any internet\\-facing network. Hitachi Energy suggests adopting user access management and antivirus protection software equipped with the latest signature rules on hosts with the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) Client application installed. Users can implement the operating system user access management functionality, if supported, to limit the probability of unauthorized access followed by rogue commands at the operating system level via MMS client application. Also, Hitachi Energy recommends following the hardening guidelines published by \u201c [The Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/)  \u201d to protect the host operating system of machines connecting with MSM. These guidelines help prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via these connected devices. Some examples for Windows based computers include:* CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks (cisecurity.org)* CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks (cisecurity.org) According to Hitachi Energy, users should follow recommended security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a network from outside attacks, including:* Physically protecting systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.* Ensuring monitoring systems have no direct connections to the internet.* Separating monitoring system networks from other networks using a firewall system with a minimal number of ports exposed Hitachi advises that monitoring systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for malware prior to connection to monitoring systems.
