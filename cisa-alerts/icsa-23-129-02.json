RISK EVALUATION\n-------------------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain user access credentials of the MSM web interface or cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.\n \n\n\n3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following Hitachi Energy products are affected:\n \n\n\n* MSM: 2\\.2\\.5 and earlier\n\n\n### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE\\-307](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The code that performs password matching when using 'basic' HTTP authentication does not use a constant\\-time memcmp and has no rate\\-limiting. An unauthenticated network attacker could brute\\-force the HTTP basic password byte\\-by\\-byte, by recording the webserver's response time until the unauthorized (401\\) response.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2021\\-43298](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43298) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.2\n [AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE\\-REPLAY CWE\\-294](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**\n\n\n\n\n The HTTP digest authentication in the GoAhead web server before 5\\.1\\.2 does not completely protect against replay attacks. An unauthenticated remote attacker could bypass authentication via capture\\-replay if TLS is not used to protect the underlying communication channel.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2020\\-15688](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15688) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (\n [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n ).\n \n\n\n\n**3\\.2\\.3\n [IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE\\-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)**\n\n\n\n\n An issue was discovered in Embedthis GoAhead 2\\.5\\.0\\. Certain pages (ex: goform/login and config/log\\_off\\_page.htm) create links containing a hostname obtained from an arbitrary HTTP host header sent by an attacker. This could potentially be used in a phishing attack.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2019\\-16645](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-16645) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n MSM is not intrinsically designed nor intended to be directly connected to the internet. Users should disconnect the device from any internet\\-facing network.\n \n\n\n\n Hitachi Energy suggests adopting user access management and antivirus protection software equipped with the latest signature rules on hosts with the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) Client application installed. Users can implement the operating system user access management functionality, if supported, to limit the probability of unauthorized access followed by rogue commands at the operating system level via MMS client application.\n \n\n\n\n Also, Hitachi Energy recommends following the hardening guidelines published by \u201c\n [The Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/) \n \u201d to protect the host operating system of machines connecting with MSM. These guidelines help prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via these connected devices. Some examples for Windows based computers include:\n \n\n\n* CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks (cisecurity.org)\n* CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks (cisecurity.org)\n\n\n\n According to Hitachi Energy, users should follow recommended security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a network from outside attacks, including:\n \n\n\n* Physically protecting systems from direct access by unauthorized personnel.\n* Ensuring monitoring systems have no direct connections to the internet.\n* Separating monitoring system networks from other networks using a firewall system with a minimal number of ports exposed\n\n\n\n Hitachi advises that monitoring systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for malware prior to connection to monitoring systems.\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see Hitachi Energy advisory\n [8DBD000154](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000154) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) \n on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\n [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) \n in the technical information paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-129-02) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2018-15504", "CVE-2021-43298", "CVE-2020-15688", "CVE-2019-12822", "CVE-2019-16645", "CVE-2018-15505", "CVE-2023-23916", "CVE-2021-41615"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-23-129-02", "title": "Hitachi Energy MSM | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "73340b155f75ac48d6b7413a990689855999bdb97e2b8ae56d32128cb05a5417"}
