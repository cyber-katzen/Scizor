RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to achieve a denial\\-of\\-service condition, arbitrary code execution, or escalate privileges.### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* SIMATIC MV500 family: Versions prior to V3\\.3\\.5### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)** The deprecated compatibility function svcunix\\_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2\\.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-23218](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-23218)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)** The deprecated compatibility function clnt\\_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2\\.34 copies its hostname argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.[CVE\\-2022\\-23219](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-23219)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)** handle\\_ipDefaultTTL in agent/mibgroup/ip\\-mib/ip\\_scalars.c in Net\\-SNMP 5\\.8 through 5\\.9\\.3 has a NULL Pointer Exception bug that can be used by a remote attacker (who has write access) to cause the instance to crash via a crafted UDP packet, resulting in denial of service.[CVE\\-2022\\-44792](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-44792)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)** handle\\_ipv6IpForwarding in agent/mibgroup/ip\\-mib/ip\\_scalars.c in Net\\-SNMP 5\\.4\\.3 through 5\\.9\\.3 has a NULL pointer exception bug that can be used by a remote attacker to cause the instance to crash via a crafted UDP packet, resulting in denial of service.[CVE\\-2022\\-44793](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-44793)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)** The AES\\-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES\\-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications. The AES\\-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP\\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\\_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES\\-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As this issue does not affect non\\-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-2975](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-2975)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.6 [INEFFICIENT REGULAR EXPRESSION COMPLEXITY CWE\\-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)** Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However, the DH\\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial\\-of\\-Service attack. The function DH\\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_ex() and EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '\\-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-3446](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3446)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.7 [EXCESSIVE ITERATION CWE\\-834](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/834.html)** Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\\_check(), DH\\_check\\_ex() or EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH\\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE\\-2023\\-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An application that calls DH\\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial\\-of\\-Service attack. The function DH\\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\\_check\\_ex() and EVP\\_PKEY\\_param\\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the \"\\-check\" option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3\\.0 and 3\\.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.[CVE\\-2023\\-3817](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-3817)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)  ).**3\\.2\\.8 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** An issue was discovered in fl\\_set\\_geneve\\_opt in net/sched/cls\\_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6\\.3\\.7\\. It allows an out\\-of\\-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA\\_FLOWER\\_KEY\\_ENC\\_OPTS\\_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.[CVE\\-2023\\-35788](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35788)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\.
