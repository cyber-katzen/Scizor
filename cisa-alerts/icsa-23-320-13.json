EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC MV500\nVulnerabilities: Classic Buffer Overflow, NULL Pointer Dereference, Improper Authentication, Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity, Excessive Iteration, Out-of-bounds Write\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to achieve a denial-of-service condition, arbitrary code execution, or escalate privileges.\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC MV500 family: Versions prior to V3.3.5\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2022-23218\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\nThe deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its hostname argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2022-23219\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nhandle_ipDefaultTTL in agent/mibgroup/ip-mib/ip_scalars.c in Net-SNMP 5.8 through 5.9.3 has a NULL Pointer Exception bug that can be used by a remote attacker (who has write access) to cause the instance to crash via a crafted UDP packet, resulting in denial of service.\nCVE-2022-44792\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nhandle_ipv6IpForwarding in agent/mibgroup/ip-mib/ip_scalars.c in Net-SNMP 5.4.3 through 5.9.3 has a NULL pointer exception bug that can be used by a remote attacker to cause the instance to crash via a crafted UDP packet, resulting in denial of service.\nCVE-2022-44793\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287\nThe AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.\nCVE-2023-2975\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.2.6\u00a0INEFFICIENT REGULAR EXPRESSION COMPLEXITY CWE-1333\nChecking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However, the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial-of-Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\nCVE-2023-3446\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.7\u00a0EXCESSIVE ITERATION CWE-834\nChecking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the \"-check\" option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\nCVE-2023-3817\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.2.8\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nAn issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.\nCVE-2023-35788\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nSIMATIC MV500 family: Update to V3.3.5 or\u00a0later version\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\u00a0Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security\u00a0and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the\u00a0Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-099606 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
