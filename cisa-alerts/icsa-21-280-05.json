TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\u00a0\nThe following versions of the InHand Networks IR615 Router are affected:\n\nIR615 Router: Versions 2.3.0.r5417 and prior\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\u00a0\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021\nThe affected product\u2019s management portal does not contain an X-FRAME-OPTIONS header, which an attacker may take advantage of by sending a link to an administrator that frames the router\u2019s management portal and could lure the administrator to perform changes.\nCVE-2021-38472 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285\nThe vendor's cloud portal allows for self-registration of the affected product without any requirements to create an account, which may allow an attacker to have full control over the product and execute code within the internal network to which the product is connected.\nCVE-2021-38486 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352\nThe affected product is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery when unauthorized commands are submitted from a user the web application trusts. This may allow an attacker to remotely perform actions on the router\u2019s management portal, such as making configuration changes, changing administrator credentials, and running system commands on the router.\nCVE-2021-38480 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nThe affected product has inadequate encryption strength, which may allow an attacker to intercept the communication and steal sensitive information or hijack the session.\nCVE-2021-38464 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n4.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPTS CWE-307\nThe affected product has no account lockout policy configured for the login page of the product. This may allow an attacker to execute a brute-force password attack with no time limitation and without harming the normal operation of the user. This could allow an attacker to gain valid credentials for the product interface.\nCVE-2021-38474 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n4.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434\nThe affected product does not have a filter or signature check to detect or prevent an upload of malicious files to the server, which may allow an attacker, acting as an administrator, to upload malicious files. This could result in cross-site scripting, deletion of system files, and remote code execution.\nCVE-2021-38484 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product does not perform sufficient input validation on client requests from the help page. This may allow an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting attack, which could allow an attacker to run code on behalf of the client browser.\nCVE-2021-38466 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n4.2.8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an attacker using a ping tool to inject commands into the device. This may allow the attacker to remotely run commands on behalf of the device.\nCVE-2021-38470 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an attacker using a traceroute tool to inject commands into the device. This may allow the attacker to remotely run commands on behalf of the device.\nCVE-2021-38478 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product\u2019s website used to control the router is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which may allow an attacker to hijack sessions of users connected to the system.\nCVE-2021-38482 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe affected product is vulnerable to stored cross-scripting, which may allow an attacker to hijack sessions of users connected to the system.\nCVE-2021-38468 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n4.2.12\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE-204\nThe affected product\u2019s authentication process response indicates and validates the existence of a username. This may allow an attacker to enumerate different user accounts.\nCVE-2021-38476 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n4.2.13\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS CWE-521\nThe affected product does not enforce an efficient password policy. This may allow an attacker with obtained user credentials to enumerate passwords and impersonate other application users and perform operations on their behalf.\nCVE-2021-38462 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nHaviv Vaizman, Hay Mizrachi, Alik Koldobsky, Ofir Manzur, and Nikolay Sokolik of OTORIO reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\u00a0\nInHand Networks recommends users upgrade to version InRouter6XX-S-V2.3.0.r5484 or later.\nFor additional information, please refer to InHand\u2019s Product Security Advisory InHand-PSA-2021-01\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
