[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric IGSS Buffer Overflow======================================= Last Revised May 06, 2013 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-018\\-01Overview-------- Independent researcher Aaron Portnoy of Exodus Intelligence has identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in Schneider Electric\u2019s Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS) application. Schneider Electric has produced a patch that fully resolves this vulnerability. Aaron Portnoy has validated this patch. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.Affected Products----------------- The Schneider Electric products affected:* IGSS application, all versions.Impact------ An exploit of this vulnerability could result in a buffer overflow that could possibly allow an attacker to execute code under administrator credentials. IGSS is employed in many sectors including renewable energy, process control, monitoring and control, motor controls, lighting controls, electrical distribution, and security systems. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.Background---------- Schneider Electric is a US\\-based company that maintains offices in 190 countries worldwide. Their products address various markets including renewable energy, process control, monitoring and control, motor controls, lighting controls, electrical distribution, and security systems. IGSS is a desktop application that is used to integrate industrial control system (ICS) components from diverse vendors using diverse sets of protocols and integrate their configuration and monitoring functions using IGSS as a single supervisory or human\\-machine interface (HMI) system. This software is employed worldwide in a broad range of application areas outside those market areas listed above.Vulnerability Characterization------------------------------### Vulnerability Overview Vulnerability classifications are classified by [Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/)  . This stack\\-based buffer overflow is classified as CWE\\-121\\.#### Stack\\-Based Buffer OverflowCWE\\-121, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121\\.html, CWE\\-121: Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Web site last accessed January 18, 2013\\. IGSS communicates with a broad range of ICS devices using a broad range of protocols over two network ports, Ports (12397 and 12399\\)/TCP by default. This exploit has found that out\\-ofprotocol communication over Port 12397/TCP can cause a buffer overflow condition. Although this overflow can cause the application to crash, an attacker can also apply techniques to take advantage of the buffer overflow and likely execute malicious code with\u00a0 administrator privileges.[CVE\\-2013\\-0657](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0657)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10\\.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?name=&vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C%29&version=2)  .### Vulnerability Details#### Exploitability This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.#### Existence of Exploit No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### Difficulty An attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.Mitigation---------- The best mitigation for this vulnerability is applying the appropriate vendor\\-supplied patch listed in the footnotes below. Schneider Electric has issued two patches for versions [V9](http://igss.schneider-electric.com/igss/igssupdates/v90/progupdatesv90.zip)  and [V10](http://igss.schneider-electric.com/igss/igssupdates/v100/progupdatesv100.zip)  If this vulnerability is not mitigated, a remote attacker could cause a buffer overflow and allow malicious code to be executed with administrator privileges. of the IGSS software to address this vulnerability. These patches are available from the Schneider Electric Web site or directly from the links in this advisory. Aaron Portnoy of Exodus Intelligence has validated the patches. Users of this software with older versions should upgrade their software or employ other mitigation methods. At a minimum, this port should be filtered to only allow access from the specific IP addresses for the devices being controlled or monitored. General measures listed below can also be employed to help mitigate this vulnerability. ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [*Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth\u00a0 Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html) . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\\-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01A\u2014Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01A.pdf)  , ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
