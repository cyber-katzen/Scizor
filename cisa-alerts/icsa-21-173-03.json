[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryCODESYS Control V2 communication================================ Last Revised June 22, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-21\\-173\\-031\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  CODESYS, GmbH* **Equipment:**  CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit, CODESYS PLCWinNT* **Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input Validation2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause a heap\\-based buffer overflow, a stack\\-based buffer overflow, or a buffer over\\-read in the affected CODESYS products. This could result in a denial\\-of\\-service condition or allow remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS CODESYS reports the following CODESYS V2 runtime systems are affected, regardless of the CPU type or operating system:* CODESYS Runtime Toolkit 32\\-bit full prior to\u00a0v2\\.4\\.7\\.55* CODESYS PLCWinNT prior\u00a0to v2\\.4\\.7\\.55### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) A crafted request may cause a heap\\-based buffer overflow in the affected CODESYS products, resulting in a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2021\\-30186](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-30186)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- CODESYS GmbH has released the following product versions to solve the noted vulnerability issues for the affected CODESYS products:* CODESYS Runtime Toolkit 32\\-bit full v2\\.4\\.7\\.55* CODESYS PLCWinNT v2\\.4\\.7\\.55\\. This will also be part of the CODESYS Development System setup v2\\.3\\.9\\.66 Please visit the [CODESYS update area](https://www.codesys.com/download)  for more information on how to obtain the software updates. As part of a security strategy, CODESYS recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure, ensuring they are not accessible from outside.* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks.* Use VPN (virtual private network) tunnels if remote access is required.* Activate and apply user management and password features.* Use encrypted communication links.* Limit access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.* Protect both development and control system operations by using up to date virus detecting solutions. For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the [CODESYS Security Whitepaper](https://customers.codesys.com/fileadmin/data/customers/security/CODESYS-Security-Whitepaper.pdf)  .
