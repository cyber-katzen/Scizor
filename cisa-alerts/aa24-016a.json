Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet\\-facing systems.\n2. Review and ensure only necessary servers and services are exposed to the internet.\n3. Review platforms or services that have credentials listed in .env files for unauthorized access or use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with threat actors deploying Androxgh0st malware. Multiple, ongoing investigations and trusted third party reporting yielded the IOCs and TTPs, and provided information on Androxgh0st malware\u2019s ability to establish a botnet that can further identify and compromise vulnerable networks.\n \n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents caused by Androxgh0st infections.\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-016A Known Indicators of Compromise Associated with Androxgh0st Malware](/sites/default/files/2024-01/aa24-016a-known-indicators-of-compromise-associated-with-adroxgh0st-malware_0.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 576\\.40 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-016A Known Indicators of Compromise Associated with Androxgh0st Malware \\- Spanish](/sites/default/files/2024-05/aa24-016a-known-indicators-of-compromise-associated-with-adroxgh0st-malware_0_ES.pdf) \n\n (PDF, 353\\.45 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-016A STIX XML](/sites/default/files/2024-01/AA24-016A.stix_.xml) \n\n (XML, 45\\.81 KB\n )\n \n\n\n\n\n[AA24\\-016A STIX JSON](/sites/default/files/2024-01/AA24-016A-known-indicators-of-compromise-associated-with-adroxgh0st-malware.stix__0.json) \n\n (JSON, 39\\.87 KB\n )\n \n\n\n### **TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n\n\n**Note:** \n This advisory uses the\n [MITRE ATT\\&CK\n \u00ae \n for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/ \"Enterprise Matrix\") \n framework, version 14\\. See the MITRE ATT\\&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors\u2019 activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT\\&CK\u2019s\n [Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\") \n and CISA\u2019s\n [Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Overview**\n\n\n\n Androxgh0st malware has been observed establishing a botnet \\[\n [T1583\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/005/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Botnet\") \n ] for victim identification and exploitation in target networks. According to open source reporting\\[\n [1](https://fortiguard.fortinet.com/threat-signal-report/5066/androxgh0st-malware-actively-used-in-the-wild \"AndroxGh0st Malware Actively Used in the Wild\") \n ], Androxgh0st is a Python\\-scripted malware \\[\n [T1059\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/006/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python\") \n ] primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information, such as credentials \\[\n [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/001/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\") \n ] for various high profile applications (i.e., Amazon Web Services \\[AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework). Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning \\[\n [T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1046/ \"Network Service Discovery\") \n ] and exploiting exposed credentials \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ] and application programming interfaces (APIs) \\[\n [T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1114/ \"Email Collection\") \n ], and web shell deployment \\[\n [T1505\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1505/003/ \"Server Software Component: Web Shell\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Targeting the PHPUnit**\n\n\n\n Androxgh0st malware TTPs commonly involves the use of scripts, conducting scanning \\[\n [T1595](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1595/ \"Active Scanning\") \n ] and searching for websites with specific vulnerabilities. In particular, threat actors deploying Androxgh0st have been observed exploiting\n [CVE\\-2017\\-9841](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9841 \"CVE-2017-9841\") \n to remotely run hypertext preprocessor (PHP) code on fallible websites via PHPUnit \\[\n [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/ \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\") \n ]. Websites using the PHPUnit module that have internet\\-accessible (exposed)\n `/vendor` \n folders are subject to malicious\n `HTTP POST` \n requests to the\n `/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` \n uniform resource identifier (URI). This PHP page runs PHP code submitted through a POST request, which allows the threat actors to remotely execute code.\n \n\n\n\n Malicious actors likely use Androxgh0st to download malicious files \\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\") \n ] to the system hosting the website. Threat actors are further able to set up a fake (illegitimate) page accessible via the URI to provide backdoor access to the website. This allows threat actors to download additional malicious files for their operations and access databases.\n \n\n\n#### **Laravel Framework Targeting**\n\n\n\n Androxgh0st malware establishes a botnet to scan for websites using the Laravel web application framework. After identifying websites using the Laravel web application, threat actors attempt to determine if the domain\u2019s root\\-level\n `.env` \n file is exposed and contains credentials for accessing additional services.\n **Note:** \n`.env` \n files commonly store credentials and tokens. Threat actors often target\n `.env` \n files to steal these credentials within the environment variables.\n \n\n\n\n If the\n `.env` \n file is exposed, threat actors will issue a GET request to the\n `/.env` \n URI to attempt to access the data on the page. Alternatively, Androxgh0st may issue a POST request to the same URI with a POST variable named\n `0x[]` \n containing certain data sent to the web server. This data is frequently used as an identifier for the threat actor. This method appears to be used for websites in debug mode (i.e., when non\\-production websites are exposed to the internet). A successful response from either of these methods allows the threat actors to look for usernames, passwords, and/or other credentials pertaining to services such as email (via SMTP) and AWS accounts.\n \n\n\n\n Androxgh0st malware can also access the application key \\[\n [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0006/ \"Credential Access\") \n ] for the Laravel application on the website. If the threat actors successfully identify the Laravel application key, they will attempt exploitation by using the key to encrypt PHP code \\[\n [T1027\\.010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1027/010/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Command Obfuscation\") \n ]. The encrypted code is then passed to the website as a value in the cross\\-site forgery request (XSRF) token cookie,\n `XSRF-TOKEN` \n , and included in a future GET request to the website. The vulnerability defined in\n [CVE\\-2018\\-15133](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15133 \"CVE-2018-15133\") \n indicates that on Laravel applications, XSRF token values are subject to an un\\-serialized call, which can allow for remote code execution. In doing so, the threat actors can upload files to the website via remote access.\n \n\n\n#### **Apache Web Server Targeting**\n\n\n\n In correlation with\n [CVE\\-2021\\-41773](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41773 \"CVE-2021-41773\") \n , Androxgh0st\n \n actors have been observed scanning vulnerable web servers \\[\n [T1595\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1595/002/ \"Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning\") \n ] running Apache HTTP Server versions 2\\.4\\.49 or 2\\.4\\.50\\. Threat actors can identify uniform resource locators (URLs) for files outside root directory through a path traversal attack \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\") \n ]. If these files are not protected by the \u201crequest all denied\u201d configuration and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are enabled, this may allow for remote code execution.\n \n\n\n\n If threat actors obtain credentials for any services using the above methods, they may use these credentials to access sensitive data or use these services to conduct additional malicious operations. For example, when threat actors successfully identify and compromise AWS credentials from a vulnerable website, they have been observed attempting to create new users and user policies \\[\n [T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1136/ \"Create Account\") \n ]. Additionally, Andoxgh0st actors have been observed creating new AWS instances to use for conducting additional scanning activity \\[\n [T1583\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/006/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services\") \n ].\n \n\n\n### **INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IOCs)**\n\n\n\n Based on investigations and analysis, the following requests are associated with Androxgh0st activity:\n \n\n\n* Incoming GET and POST requests to the following URIs:\n\t+ `/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php`\n\t+ `/.env`\n* Incoming POST requests with the following strings:\n\t+ `[0x%5B%5D=androxgh0st]`\n\t+ `ImmutableMultiDict([('0x[]', 'androxgh0st')])`\n\n\n\n In both previously listed POST request strings, the name\n `androxgh0st` \n has been observed to be replaced with other monikers.\n \n\n\n\n Additional URIs observed by the FBI and a trusted third party used by these threat actors for credential exfiltration include:\n \n\n\n* `/info`\n* `/phpinfo`\n* `/phpinfo.php`\n* `/?phpinfo=1`\n* `/frontend_dev.php/$`\n*

activity. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n\n These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations and network defenders. FBI and CISA recommend that software manufacturers incorporate secure by design principles and tactics into their software development practices, limiting the impact of actor techniques and strengthening their customers\u2019 security posture. For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage.\n \n\n\n\n The FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by actors using Androxgh0st malware.\n \n\n\n* **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Specifically, ensure that Apache servers are not running versions 2\\.4\\.49 or 2\\.4\\.50\\.** \n Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost\\-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\") \n in internet\\-facing systems.\n* **Verify that the default configuration for all URIs is to deny all requests** \n unless there is a specific need for it to be accessible.\n* **Ensure that any live Laravel applications are not in \u201cdebug\u201d or testing mode. Remove all cloud credentials from** \n`.env`\n**files and revoke them. All cloud providers have safer ways to provide temporary, frequently rotated credentials to code running inside a web server without storing them in any file.**\n* **On a one\\-time basis for previously stored cloud credentials, and on an on\\-going basis for other types of credentials that cannot be removed, review any platforms or services that have credentials listed in the** \n`.env`\n**file for unauthorized access or use.**\n* **Scan the server\u2019s file system for unrecognized PHP files** \n , particularly in the root directory or\n `/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP` \n folder.\n* **Review outgoing GET requests (via cURL command) to file hosting sites** \n such as GitHub, pastebin, etc., particularly when the request accesses a\n `.php` \n file.\n\n\n### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS**\n\n\n\n In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n \n\n\n\n To get started:\n \n\n\n1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 1\\-10\\).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\n\n\n FBI and CISA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n \n\n\n### **REPORTING**\n\n\n\n The FBI encourages organizations to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their\n [local FBI field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/ \"Field Offices\") \n . With regards to specific information that appears in this CSA, indicators should always be evaluated in light of an organization\u2019s complete security situation.\n \n\n\n\n When available, each report submitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity, number of people, and type of equipment used for the activity, the name of the submitting company or organization, and a designated point of contact. Reports can be submitted to the FBI\n [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\\)](https://www.ic3.gov/ \"Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\") \n , a\n [local FBI Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices \"Field Offices\") \n , or to CISA via its\n [Incident Reporting System](https://www.cisa.gov/forms/report \"Incident Reporting System\") \n or its 24/7 Operations Center at\n [report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov \"Report to CISA\") \n or by calling 1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA (1\\-844\\-729\\-2472\\).\n \n\n\n### **RESOURCES**\n\n\n* [CISA: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog \"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\")\n* [CISA, MITRE: Best Practices for MITRE ATT\\&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping \"Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\")\n* [CISA: Decider Tool](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/ \"cisagov / decider\")\n* [NIST: CVE\\-2017\\-9841](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9841 \"CVE-2017-9841\")\n* [NIST: CVE\\-2018\\-15133](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15133 \"CVE-2018-15133\")\n* [NIST: CVE\\-2021\\-41773](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41773 \"CVE-2021-41773\")\n* [CISA: Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")\n* [CISA: Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\")\n\n\n### **REFERENCES**\n\n\n1.
