MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nSchneider Electric has released fixes for the vulnerability that can be downloaded from:\n\nM340: https://www.schneider-electric.fr/fr/search/V2.9?filters=CAT_PRD_DOC_FIRMUPD\nM580: https://www.schneider-electric.us/en/product-range/62098-modicon-m580-paccontroller/\nQuantum: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/OFS_3_50_2905/\n\nSchneider Electric recommends the following workarounds and mitigations for Premium and M1E devices:\n\nSet up a firewall blocking all remote/external access to Port 502\n\nFor more information Schneider Electric has released a security notification that can be found at: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-048-02/\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
