Researchers Carlos Mario Penagos Hollmann of IOActive, Michael Messner, and Luigi\u00a0Auriemma have separately identified multiple vulnerabilities in Sielco Sistemi\u2019s Winlog application. Sielco Sistemi has produced a new release that corrects all identified vulnerabilities. Mr. Hollmann and Mr. Auriemma have tested the release to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited. Exploit code is publicly available for these vulnerabilities.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Sielco Sistemi products are affected.* Winlog Pro SCADA, all versions prior to 2\\.07\\.18* Winlog Lite SCADA, all versions prior to 2\\.07\\.18\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a program crash, information leakage, or arbitrary code execution. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Sielco Sistemi is an Italy\\-based company that creates supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)/human\\-machine interface (HMI) software and hardware products. Winlog Lite SCADA is a demo version of the Winlog Pro SCADA/HMI system. According to Sielco Sistemi, Winlog Pro SCADA is deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, public utilities, telecommunications, and others. Sielco Sistemi products are deployed mainly in Italy, Turkey, Canada, USA, Indonesia, and Spain.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### FAILURE TO CONSTRAIN OPERATIONS WITH THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE\\-119: Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, web site last accessed July 31, 2012\\. By sending malicious specially crafted packets to Port 46824/TCP, an attacker can overflow a memory buffer on the target system. Errors in RunTime.exe and TCPIPS\\_Story.dll can be exploited by these packets to cause the buffer overflow. The packets can also cause a boundary error in RunTime.exe causing the buffer overflow. This can allow the attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition leading to a crash or possible execution of arbitrary code.

This update, Winlog Pro SCADA and Winlog Lite SCADA Version 2\\.07\\.18, is available for customer download at the following location: [http://www.sielcosistemi.com/en/news/index.html?id\\=70](http://www.sielcosistemi.com/en/news/index.html?id=70)  ICS\\-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at: [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
