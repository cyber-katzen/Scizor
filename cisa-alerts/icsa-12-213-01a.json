Sielco Sistemi has produced a new release that corrects all identified vulnerabilities. Mr. Hollmann and Mr. Auriemma have tested the release to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited. Exploit code is publicly available for these vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Sielco Sistemi products are affected.\n\nWinlog Pro SCADA, all versions prior to 2.07.18\nWinlog Lite SCADA, all versions prior to 2.07.18.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a program crash, information leakage, or arbitrary code execution.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSielco Sistemi is an Italy-based company that creates supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)/human-machine interface (HMI) software and hardware products.\nWinlog Lite SCADA is a demo version of the Winlog Pro SCADA/HMI system. According to Sielco Sistemi, Winlog Pro SCADA is deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, public utilities, telecommunications, and others. Sielco Sistemi products are deployed mainly in Italy, Turkey, Canada, USA, Indonesia, and Spain.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nFAILURE TO CONSTRAIN OPERATIONS WITH THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE-119: Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html, web site last accessed July 31, 2012.\n\nBy sending malicious specially crafted packets to Port 46824/TCP, an attacker can overflow a memory buffer on the target system. Errors in RunTime.exe and TCPIPS_Story.dll can be exploited by these packets to cause the buffer overflow. The packets can also cause a boundary error in RunTime.exe causing the buffer overflow. This can allow the attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition leading to a crash or possible execution of arbitrary code.\nCVE-2012-3815NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3815 , web site last accessed July 31, 2012. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed March 18, 2014.\n\nIMPROPER ACCESS CONTROLCWE-284: Improper Access Control,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html, web site last accessed July 31, 2012.\n\nUnauthorized users can access and read files on the system that Winlog is running by causing an input validation error. An attacker can send a malicious specially formed packet to Port 46824/TCP to allow unauthorized access to the system, which may lead to information leakage.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 3 --------\nCVE-2012-4353NVD: CVE-2012-4353, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4353, web site last accessed March 18, 2014. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed March 18, 2014.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 3 ----------\n\nIMPROPER ACCESS OF INDEXABLE RESOURCECWE-118: Improper Access of Indexable Resource,\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/118.html, web site last accessed July 31, 2012.\n\nBy sending malicious specially crafted packets that point outside of the defined array, an attacker can cause a crash of the system. By using 32-bit operation coding, a file pointer outside the array can be used to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial-of-service condition leading to a crash.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 --------\nCVE-2012-4354NVD: CVE-2012-4354, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4354, web site last accessed March 18, 2014. and CVE-2012-4355NVD: CVE-2012-4355, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4355, web site last accessed March 18, 2014. have been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed March 18, 2014.\n\nDIRECTORY TRAVERSALCWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),\u00a0 http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, web site last accessed March 18, 2014.\n\nAn input validation error when processing certain requests can be exploited to disclose arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences sent in a specially crafted packet to TCP Port 46824.\nCVE-2012-4356NVD: CVE-2012-4356, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4356, web site last accessed March 18, 2014.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The error when allocating when processing these malicious packets can be exploited to reference an invalid memory location. This exploit could cause a crash of the system.\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 --------\nCVE-2012-4358NVD: CVE-2012-4358, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4358, web site last accessed March 18, 2014. and CVE-2012-4359NVD: CVE-2012-4359, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4359, web site last accessed March 18, 2014. have been assigned to this vulnerability.

This update, Winlog Pro SCADA and Winlog Lite SCADA Version 2.07.18, is available for customer download at the following location:\u00a0 \u00a0http://www.sielcosistemi.com/en/news/index.html?id=70\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
