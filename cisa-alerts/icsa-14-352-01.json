Honeywell has produced several patch updates (R400\\.6, R410\\.6 and 430\\.6\\) that resolve these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following Honeywell Experion PKS versions are affected:\n \n\n\n* All supported Experion PKS R40x versions prior to Experion PKS R400\\.6\n* All supported Experion PKS R41x versions prior to Experion PKS R410\\.6\n* All supported Experion PKS R43x versions prior to Experion PKS R430\\.2\n\n\n\n Note \\- Experion PKS R311\\.2 is impacted by these vulnerabilities but is no longer supported by Honeywell. Customers running Experion PKS R311\\.2 should upgrade to a supported version of Experion PKS.\n \n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Honeywell EPKS is a distributed control system solution sold globally by Honeywell Process Solutions. EPKS is used for automation and control of industrial and manufacturing processes.\n \n\n\n\n Honeywell\u2019s integrated process automation EPKS consists of web\\-based SCADA systems. Experion PKS is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy and Healthcare and Public Health.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### HEAP\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE\\-122: Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122\\.html, web site last accessed December 18, 2014\\.\n\n\n\n\n Multiple heap\\-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the confd.exe, dual\\_onsrv.exe, hscodbcn.exe, and ripsd.exe modules, which could lead to possible remote code execution or denial of service.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2014\\-9187NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-9187, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at:\n [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n .
