Honeywell has produced several patch updates (R400.6, R410.6 and 430.6) that resolve these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Honeywell Experion PKS versions are affected:\n\nAll supported Experion PKS R40x versions prior to Experion PKS R400.6\nAll supported Experion PKS R41x versions prior to Experion PKS R410.6\nAll supported Experion PKS R43x versions prior to Experion PKS R430.2\n\nNote - Experion PKS R311.2 is impacted by these vulnerabilities but is no longer supported by Honeywell. Customers running Experion PKS R311.2 should upgrade to a supported version of Experion PKS.\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nHoneywell EPKS is a distributed control system solution sold globally by Honeywell Process Solutions. EPKS is used for automation and control of industrial and manufacturing processes.\nHoneywell\u2019s integrated process automation EPKS consists of web-based SCADA systems. Experion PKS is deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy and Healthcare and Public Health.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nHEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html, web site last accessed December 18, 2014.\n\nMultiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the confd.exe, dual_onsrv.exe, hscodbcn.exe, and ripsd.exe modules, which could lead to possible remote code execution or denial of service.\nCVE-2014-9187NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9187, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
