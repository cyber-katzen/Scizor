EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-Bounds Read, Use After Free\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-222-07 Siemens SIMATIC NET CP that was published August 10, 2021, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to access sensitive information and execute arbitrary code.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens products are affected:\n\nSIMATIC NET CP 1543-1 (Incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v3.0\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC CP 1545-1 (6GK7545-1GX00-0XE0): All versions prior to v1.1\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in mod_cap via the cap_text.ccap_to_text function, which could lead to information disclosure.\nCVE-2020-9272 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nA malicious attacker could corrupt the memory pool by interrupting the data transfer channel. This triggers a use-after-free condition in alloc_pool in pool.c, which could lead to remote code execution.\nCVE-2020-9273 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to the latest software version:\n\nSIMATIC NET CP 1543-1 (Incl. SIPLUS NET variants): Update to v3.0 or later\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\n\nSIMATIC CP 1545-1 (6GK7545-1GX00-0XE0): Update to v1.1 or later\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nDisable the embedded FTP server. The server is deactivated in the default configuration.\nLimit access to Port 21/TCP to trusted IP addresses.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security, and follow the recommendations in the product manual.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information about this issue, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-679335\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
