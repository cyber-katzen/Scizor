TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SIPLUS TIM 1531 IRC, are affected:\n\nSIPLUS TIM 1531 IRC (6AG1543-1MX00-7XE0): All versions prior to 2.4.8\nSIPLUS TIM 1531 IRC (6GK7543-1MX00-0XE0): All versions prior to 2.4.8\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi: target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible code.\nCVE-2021-47178 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.2 OUT-OF-BOUNDS-WRITE CWE-787\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue.\nCVE-2022-1015 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C (https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)).\n3.2.3 INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\nA timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.\nCVE-2022-4304 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.4 DOUBLE FREE CWE-415\nThe function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.\nCVE-2022-4450 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.5 MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nAn issue was discovered the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.18.17. Unprivileged guest users can compromise the guest kernel because TLB flush operations are mishandled in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations.\nCVE-2022-39189 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.6 INCORRECT CONVERSION BETWEEN NUMERIC TYPES CWE-681\nCasting an internal value could lead to floating point exception under certain circumstances. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition on affected devices.\nCVE-2022-40225 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2022-40225. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.7 INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190\nAn issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. When parsing a multi-gigabyte XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault.\nCVE-2022-40303 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.8 DOUBLE FREE CWE-415\nAn issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. Certain invalid XML entity definitions can corrupt a hash table key, potentially leading to subsequent logic errors. In one case, a double-free can be provoked.\nCVE-2022-40304 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.9 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free.\nCVE-2022-45886 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.10 CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE-362\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/usb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c has a memory leak because of the lack of a dvb_frontend_detach call.\nCVE-2022-45887 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.11 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event.\nCVE-2022-45919 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.12 IMPROPER LOCKING CWE-667\nA deadlock flaw was found in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to potentially crash the system.\nCVE-2023-0160 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.13 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nThe public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\nCVE-2023-0215 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.14 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThere is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.\nCVE-2023-0286 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.15 IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nA security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the -policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function.\nCVE-2023-0464 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.16 IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nApplications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the -policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function.\nCVE-2023-0465 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.17 IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\nThe function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.\nCVE-2023-0466 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.18 OUT-OF-BOUNDS-WRITE CWE-787\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFS file system in how a user restores an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\nCVE-2023-1017 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.19 OUT-OF-BOUNDS-WRITE CWE-787\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFS file system in how a user restores an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\nCVE-2023-2124 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.20 IMPROPER LOCKING CWE-667\nA denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.\nCVE-2023-2269 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.21 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nIn multiple functions of binder.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use-after-free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\nCVE-2023-21255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.22 NULL POINTER DEFERENCE CWE-416\nThis vulnerability is triggered by a malicious client that invokes the ConditionRefresh method on the server which asynchronously executes the call in the background by starting a new thread each time being called. The attack may lead to high load situation and memory exhaustion, and may block the server.\nCVE-2023-27321 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.23 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nA use after free vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way libcurl offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a SHA 256 hash. When this check fails, libcurl would free the memory for the fingerprint before it returns an error message containing the (now freed) hash. This flaw risks inserting sensitive heap-based data into the error message that might be shown to users or otherwise get leaked and revealed.\nCVE-2023-28319 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.24 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nAn issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation\nCVE-2023-35788 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.25 CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE-326\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2.

A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\n3.2.30 LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835\nThe web server of affected products, if configured to allow the import of PKCS12 containers, could end up in an infinite loop when processing incomplete certificate chains.This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by importing specially crafted PKCS12 containers.\nCVE-2023-50763 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2023-50763. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.31 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZEend multi-iovec user SDMA requests hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a Here are the specific bugs: 1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len. Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec to the packet, even if some of thosebytes are past iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet. 2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the packet. Thetransmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the iovec pages. This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2 because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail iovec of an SDMA request. Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache (struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So this commit fixes those issues as well. Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec payload user SDMA requests can hit: 1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate pinnings. 2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node), the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2) releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock to insert the extended mmu_rb_node. If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2) and (3), insert in (3) will fail. The failure path code in this case unpins all pages in either the original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between (2) and (3). 3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented. 4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object. If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests complete.\nCVE-2023-52474 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemen' operational guidelines for induatrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-337522 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
