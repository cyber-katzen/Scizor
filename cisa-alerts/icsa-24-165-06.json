To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS\\#1 v1\\.5, RSA\\-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre\\-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre\\-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.[CVE\\-2022\\-4304](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4304)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.4** [**DOUBLE FREE CWE\\-415**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html) The function PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name\\_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM\\_read\\_bio() and PEM\\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\\_X509\\_INFO\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() and SSL\\_CTX\\_use\\_serverinfo\\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\\_read\\_bio\\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3\\.0\\. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.[CVE\\-2022\\-4450](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-4450)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\\_f\\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO then a use\\-after\\-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\\_write\\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\\_new\\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_ASN1\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_CMS\\_stream, PEM\\_write\\_bio\\_PKCS7\\_stream, SMIME\\_write\\_ASN1, SMIME\\_write\\_CMS and SMIME\\_write\\_PKCS7\\. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\\_ASN1\\_bio\\_stream, BIO\\_new\\_CMS, BIO\\_new\\_PKCS7, i2d\\_CMS\\_bio\\_stream and i2d\\_PKCS7\\_bio\\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.[CVE\\-2023\\-0215](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0215)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3\\.1 base score of 5\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)  ).#### **3\\.2\\.14** [**IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE\\-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\\_NAME\\_cmp as an ASN1\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_CRL\\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.[CVE\\-2023\\-0286](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0286)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_add0\\_policy() function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set1\\_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509\\_VERIFY\\_PARAM\\_set\\_flags() with the X509\\_V\\_FLAG\\_POLICY\\_CHECK flag argument.

Rather, user\\_sdma\\_txadd() will add up to PAGE\\_SIZE bytes from iovec to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past iovec\\-\\>iov.iov\\_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet. 2\\. user\\_sdma\\_txadd() and user\\_sdma\\_send\\_pkts() fail to advance to the next iovec in user\\_sdma\\_request\\-\\>iovs when the current iovec is not PAGE\\_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the iovec pages. This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2 because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE\\_SIZE as the tail iovec of an SDMA request. Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache (struct mmu\\_rb\\_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE\\_SIZE. So this commit fixes those issues as well. Here are the mmu\\_rb\\_handler bugs that non\\-PAGE\\_SIZE\\-end multi\\-iovec payload user SDMA requests can hit: 1\\. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu\\_rb\\_handler will result in duplicate pinnings. 2\\. When extending an existing mmu\\_rb\\_handler entry (struct mmu\\_rb\\_node), the mmu\\_rb code (1\\) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2\\) releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3\\) then reacquires the lock to insert the extended mmu\\_rb\\_node. If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2\\) and (3\\), insert in (3\\) will fail. The failure path code in this case unpins all pages in either the original mmu\\_rb\\_node or the new mmu\\_rb\\_node that was inserted between (2\\) and (3\\). 3\\. In hfi1\\_mmu\\_rb\\_remove\\_unless\\_exact(), mmu\\_rb\\_node\\-\\>refcount is incremented outside of mmu\\_rb\\_handler\\-\\>lock. As a result, mmu\\_rb\\_node could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu\\_rb\\_handler\\-\\>lock and checks mmu\\_rb\\_node\\-\\>refcount before mmu\\_rb\\_node\\-\\>refcount is incremented. 4\\. Related to \\#2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not check mmu\\_rb\\_node\\-\\>refcount before freeing mmu\\_rb\\_node object. If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have pointers to the now\\-freed mmu\\_rb\\_node(s), those pointers to the now\\-freed mmu\\_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests complete.[CVE\\-2023\\-52474](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-52474)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
