Users can download the new firmware at the following location:\nhttp://www.janitza.com/experimental-downloads.html\nUsers may also download a manual telling how to secure a TCP/IP connection for UMG 604, UMG 605, UMG 508, UMG 509, UMG 511 and UMG 512 at the following location:\nhttp://www.janitza.com/download-manuals-current-devices.html\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nBlock outside access to Ports 1239/TCP, 1234/UDP, and 1235/UDP at the firewall. Use an intrusion detection system (IDS) or an intrusion prevention system (IPS) to monitor access to those ports.\nShield the device from any publicly accessible networks by implementing proper network segregation and by filtering the exposed network services using a network firewall.\nManage devices from a well secured management PC only, and users should not visit untrusted web sites.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
