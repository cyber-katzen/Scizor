RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges to root-level access.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Crestron AirMedia Presentation System products are affected:\n\nAM-300: Version 1.4499.00018\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\nThere is an OS command injection vulnerability in Crestron AM-300 firmware version 1.4499.00018 which may enable a user of a limited-access SSH session to escalate their privileges to root-level access.\nCVE-2023-6926\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is\u00a0AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nUri Katz of Claroty Research Team82 reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCrestron has resolved this vulnerability in firmware version 1.4499.00023.001 or higher. Please see\u00a0https://security.crestron.com\u00a0or contact True Blue Support for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJanuary 23, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
