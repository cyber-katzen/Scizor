Summary     Description     CISA received one Windows Portable Executable (PE) file for analysis. The file is a variant of TrueBot malware. It is designed to collect system information and report it to a command\\-and\\-control (C2\\). The bot is also capable of downloading and executing additional payloads.

The file is padded with over one gigabyte (Gb) of junk code, designed to hinder analysis. When the bot is executed on the system, it will check the current Operating System (OS) version (RtlGetVersion) and the processor architecture (GetNativeSystemInfo). From this information the bot will create a unique ID for the compromised system. It will store the ID in C:\\\\ProgramData as a randomly named 13 character file with a .JSONIP extension, e.g. \u2018IgtyXEQuCEvAM.JSONIP\u2019.       The malware proceeds to enumerate all running processes on the system. The bot configuration contains a list of common Windows processes that are excluded from its list. The remaining process names are concatenated into a base64 encoded string. The malware specifically looks for the presence of the following disassembly and debugging tools:       \u2014Begin Disassembly \\& Debugging Tools\u2014     IDA Pro     Process Monitor     ProcessHacker     Process Explorer     CFF Explorer     Resource Hacker     Cheatengine\\-x86\\_64     OllyDbg     Radare2     X64dbg     WinDbg     Zeta Debugger     Rock Debugger     Obsidian debugger     \u2014End Disassembly \\& Debugging Tools\u2014       The presence of these tools does not change the execution of the malware. They are also concatenated into a base64 encoded string and sent along with the system information.       Next, the malware will collect the ComputerName and Domain name of the system. All of the collected information and the unique ID is sent to a hard\\-coded Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in a POST request using a unique User\\-agent string:       \u2014Begin POST Request\u2014     POST     dremmfyttrred\\[.]com/dns.php     Content\\-type: application/x\\-www\\-form\\-urlencoded     Mozilla/112\\.0 (compatible; MSIE 11\\.0; Windows NT 10\\.00\\)     \u2014End POST Request\u2014       The malware uses a second obfuscated domain to accept commands and receive additional payloads. The configuration contains two base64 encoded strings that the malware will decode and run through a string operation to generate a unique hexadecimal string. The hexadecimal string is decoded using the embedded RC4 key \u2018YiPumybosaWiWexy\u2019. The following URL was decoded from the strings:       \u2014Begin Decoded URL\u2014     droogggdhfhf\\[.]com/gate.php     \u2014End Decoded URL\u2014     dremmfyttrred\\[.]com     Tags     command\\-and\\-control     HTTP Sessions  * POST     dremmfyttrred\\[.]com/dns.php     Content\\-type: application/x\\-www\\-form\\-urlencoded     Mozilla/112\\.0 (compatible; MSIE 11\\.0; Windows NT 10\\.00\\)    Relationships    | dremmfyttrred\\[.]com | Connected\\_From | 7d75244449fb5c25d8f196a43a6eb9e453652b2185392376e7d44c21bd8431e7 | | --- | --- | --- |    Description     3LXJyA6Gf.exe attempts to send the collected system information to this domain.     droogggdhfhf\\[.]com     Tags     command\\-and\\-control     Relationships    | droogggdhfhf\\[.]com | Connected\\_From | 7d75244449fb5c25d8f196a43a6eb9e453652b2185392376e7d44c21bd8431e7 | | --- | --- | --- |    Description     3LXJyA6Gf.exe receives commands and payloads from this domain.

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.  * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
