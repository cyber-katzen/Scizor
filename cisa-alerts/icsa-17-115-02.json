Public exploits are available.**Vendor:**  Sierra Wireless**Equipment:**  AirLink Raven XE and XT**Vulnerabilities:**  Improper Authorization, Cross\\-Site Request Forgery, Insufficiently Protected CredentialsREPOSTED INFORMATION-------------------- This advisory is a follow\\-up to the alert titled [ICS\\-ALERT\\-16\\-182\\-01 Sierra Wireless AirLink Raven XE and XT Gateway Vulnerabilities](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-16-182-01)  that was published *June 30, 2016,*  on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Sierra Wireless gateways are affected:* AirLink Raven XE, all versions prior to 4\\.0\\.14, and* AirLink Raven XT, all versions prior to 4\\.0\\.11\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to perform unauthorized sensitive functions compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.MITIGATION---------- Sierra Wireless has released new firmware versions to address the forced browsing and cross\\-site request forgery vulnerabilities. Sierra Wireless reports that the insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability will not be addressed. Sierra Wireless\u2019s Raven XE firmware Version 4\\.0\\.14, is available at the following location:[https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software\\_downloads/nucaleos/raven\\-xe\\-firmware\\-list/](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_downloads/nucaleos/raven-xe-firmware-list/)  Sierra Wireless\u2019s Raven XT firmware Version 4\\.0\\.11, is available at the following location:[https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software\\_downloads/nucaleos/raven\\-xt\\-firmware\\-list/](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_downloads/nucaleos/raven-xt-firmware-list/)  Sierra Wireless has released a Technical Bulletin, which is available at the following location:[https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software\\_reference\\_docs/raven\\-ics\\-alert\\-16\\-182\\-01/](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_reference_docs/raven-ics-alert-16-182-01/)  For additional information about these vulnerabilities or the recommendations provided, please contact Sierra Wireless\u2019 security team at:[security@sierrawireless.com](mailto:security@sierrawireless.com)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several files and directories can be accessed without authentication, which may allow a remote attacker to perform sensitive functions including arbitrary file upload, file download, and device reboot.[CVE\\-2017\\-6044](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6044)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
