MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Delta Electronics recommends users uninstall old versions of InfraSuite Device Master and reinstall the updated version 1\\.0\\.5\n [using the installer](https://datacenter-softwarecenter.deltaww.com/Download/UPS/Software/InfraSuite_Device_Master_1.0.5(x64).exe) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\n [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01) \n .\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.
