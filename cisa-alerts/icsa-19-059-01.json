EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 8.5\n\nATTENTION: Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: PSI GridConnect GmbH (formerly known as PSI Nentec GmbH)\nEquipment: Telecontrol Gateway and Smart Telecontrol Unit family, IEC104 Security Proxy\nVulnerability: Cross-site Scripting\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute dynamic scripts in the context of the application, which could allow cross-site scripting attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products are affected:\n\nTelecontrol Gateway 3G Versions 4.2.21, 5.0.27, 5.1.19, 6.0.16 and prior;\nTelecontrol Gateway XS-MU Versions 4.2.21, 5.0.27, 5.1.19, 6.0.16 and prior;\nTelecontrol Gateway VM Versions 4.2.21, 5.0.27, 5.1.19, 6.0.16 and prior;\nSmart Telecontrol Unit TCG Versions 5.0.27, 5.1.19, 6.0.16 and prior; and\nIEC104 Security Proxy Version 2.2.10 and prior.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\nThe web application browser interprets input as active HTML, JavaScript, or VBScript, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2019-6528 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nM. Can Kurnaz reported this vulnerability to NCCIC. NCCIC\u00a0coordinated with BSI Germany.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPSI recommends users of affected devices update their devices to a version where this vulnerability is patched.\nTo obtain the update, contact PSI GridConnect via email at: support@psigridconnect.com. A fix for the vulnerability is available in the following software releases:\n\n5.1.20,\n6.0.17, and\nIEC104 Security Proxy Version 2.2.11\n\nThe following software releases are no longer supported:\n\n4.2.x, and\n5.0.x\n\nPSI recommends deactivating the webserver via CLI since the web interface is not essential to the configuration of the device.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
