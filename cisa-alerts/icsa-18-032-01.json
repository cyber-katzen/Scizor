[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryFuji Electric V\\-Server VPR=========================== Last Revised February 01, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-18\\-032\\-01### **CVSS v3 8\\.6****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.**Vendor:**  Fuji Electric**Equipment:**  V\\-Server VPR**Vulnerability:**  Stack\\-based Buffer OverflowAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of V\\-Server VPR, a data collection and management service, are affected:* V\\-Server VPR 4\\.0\\.1\\.0 and prior.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to view sensitive information and disrupt the availability of the device.MITIGATION---------- Fuji Electric has produced firmware 4\\.0\\.3\\.0 that can be obtained from:[https://felib.fujielectric.co.jp/download/details.htm?dataid\\=26385302\\&site\\=global\\&lang\\=en](https://felib.fujielectric.co.jp/download/details.htm?dataid=26385302&site=global&lang=en)  NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2018\\-5442](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-5442)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
