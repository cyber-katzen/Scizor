EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 2.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Yokogawa\nEquipment: Main equipment\nVulnerability: Buffer Copy Without Checking Size of Input\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could terminate the program abnormally.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nYokogawa reports that the vulnerability affects the tool for programming FA-M3 PLCs:\n\nWideField3 R1.01 - R4.03\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT CWE-120\nA buffer overflow could be caused when a user loads a maliciously crafted project file.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-16232 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nParity Dynamics reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nYokogawa has prepared revision R4.04 to address this vulnerability and recommends that users switch to this revision.\nFor more information about this vulnerability and the associated mitigations, please see Yokogawa\u2019s security advisory report YSAR-20-0002\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\u00a0\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\u00a0\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\u00a0\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
