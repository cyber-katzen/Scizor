An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform remote code execution on an unprotected system.\u00a0\nAccording to Microsoft, an attacker can send specially crafted packets to one of these operating systems that has RDP enabled.[1] After successfully sending the packets, the attacker would have the ability to perform a number of actions: adding accounts with full user rights; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or installing programs. This exploit, which requires no user interaction, must occur before authentication to be successful.\nBlueKeep is considered \u201cwormable\u201d because malware exploiting this vulnerability on a system could propagate to other vulnerable systems; thus, a BlueKeep exploit would be capable of rapidly spreading in a fashion similar to the WannaCry malware attacks of 2017.[2]\nCISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA encourages users and administrators review the Microsoft Security Advisory [3] and the Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708 [4] and apply the appropriate mitigation measures as soon as possible:\n\nInstall available patches. Microsoft has released security updates to patch this vulnerability. Microsoft has also released patches for a number of OSs that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. As always, CISA encourages users and administrators to test patches before installation.\n\nFor OSs that do not have patches or systems that cannot be patched, other mitigation steps can be used to help protect against BlueKeep:\n\nUpgrade end-of-life (EOL) OSs. Consider upgrading any EOL OSs no longer supported by Microsoft to a newer, supported OS, such as Windows 10.\nDisable unnecessary services. Disable services not being used by the OS. This best practice limits exposure to vulnerabilities. \u00a0\nEnable Network Level Authentication. Enable Network Level Authentication in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Doing so forces a session request to be authenticated and effectively mitigates against BlueKeep, as exploit of the vulnerability requires an unauthenticated session.\nBlock Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall. Because port 3389 is used to initiate an RDP session, blocking it prevents an attacker from exploiting BlueKeep from outside the user\u2019s network. However, this will block legitimate RDP sessions and may not prevent unauthenticated sessions from being initiated inside a network.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE-2019-0708\n[2] White House Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea\n[3] Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE-2019-0708\n[4] Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708\n\nRevisions\n\nJune 17, 2019: Initial version|June 17, 2019: Revised technical details section.\n",
