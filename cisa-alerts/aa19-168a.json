An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform remote code execution on an unprotected system.\n \n\n\n\n According to Microsoft, an attacker can send specially crafted packets to one of these operating systems that has RDP enabled.\n [\\[1]](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708) \n After successfully sending the packets, the attacker would have the ability to perform a number of actions: adding accounts with full user rights; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or installing programs. This exploit, which requires no user interaction, must occur before authentication to be successful.\n \n\n\n\n BlueKeep is considered \u201cwormable\u201d because malware exploiting this vulnerability on a system could propagate to other vulnerable systems; thus, a BlueKeep exploit would be capable of rapidly spreading in a fashion similar to the WannaCry malware attacks of 2017\\.\n [\\[2]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-on-the-attribution-of-the-wannacry-malware-attack-to-north-korea-121917/) \n\n\n\n\n CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.\n \n\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\n\n\n CISA encourages users and administrators review the Microsoft Security Advisory\n [\\[3]](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708) \n and the Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE\\-2019\\-0708\n [\\[4]](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708) \n and apply the appropriate mitigation measures as soon as possible:\n \n\n\n* **Install available patches.** \n Microsoft has released security updates to patch this vulnerability. Microsoft has also released patches for a number of OSs that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003\\. As always, CISA encourages users and administrators to test patches before installation.\n\n\n\n For OSs that do not have patches or systems that cannot be patched, other mitigation steps can be used to help protect against BlueKeep:\n \n\n\n* **Upgrade end\\-of\\-life (EOL) OSs.** \n Consider upgrading any EOL OSs no longer supported by Microsoft to a newer, supported OS, such as Windows 10\\.\n* **Disable unnecessary services.** \n Disable services not being used by the OS. This best practice limits exposure to vulnerabilities.\n* **Enable Network Level Authentication.** \n Enable Network Level Authentication in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2\\. Doing so forces a session request to be authenticated and effectively mitigates against BlueKeep, as exploit of the vulnerability requires an unauthenticated session.\n* **Block Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.** \n Because port 3389 is used to initiate an RDP session, blocking it prevents an attacker from exploiting BlueKeep from outside the user\u2019s network. However, this will block legitimate RDP sessions and may not prevent unauthenticated sessions from being initiated inside a network.\n\n\n\n### References\n\n\n\n\n[\\[1] Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE\\-2019\\-0708](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708) \n\n\n[\\[2] White House Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-on-the-attribution-of-the-wannacry-malware-attack-to-north-korea-121917) \n\n\n[\\[3] Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE\\-2019\\-0708](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708) \n\n\n[\\[4] Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE\\-2019\\-0708](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708) \n\n\n### Revisions\n\n\n\n\n June 17, 2019: Initial version\\|June 17, 2019: Revised technical details section.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa19-168a) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-193A\n \n\n### [CISA Red Team\u2019s Operations Against a Federal Civilian Executive Branch Organization Highlights the Necessity of Defense\\-in\\-Depth](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-193a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 08, 2024\n \n\n\n Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-190A\n \n\n### [People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Ministry of State Security APT40 Tradecraft in Action](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-190a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 10, 2024\n \n\n\n Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-131A\n \n\n### [\\#StopRansomware: Black Basta](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-131a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apr 18, 2024\n \n\n\n Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-109A\n \n\n### [\\#StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-109a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2019-0708"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "aa19-168a", "title": "Microsoft Operating Systems BlueKeep Vulnerability | CISA", "source": "cybersecurity-advisories", "id": "1ba96bcff42fd3b2598cae0b1a504b0783b90d3529f591d2f97de30fc3b666e9"}
