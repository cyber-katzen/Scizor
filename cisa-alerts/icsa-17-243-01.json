Siemens recommends users protect network access with appropriate mechanisms such as firewalls, segmentation, and VPNs. Siemens also advises that users configure the operational environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security:[https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational\\-guidelines\\-industrial\\-security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA\\-535640 at the following location:<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories> The OPC Foundation also published a security bulletin for this vulnerability:[https://opcfoundation\\-onlineapplications.org/faq/SecurityBulletins/OPC\\_Foundation\\_Security\\_Bulletin\\_CVE\\-2017\\-12069\\.pdf](https://opcfoundation-onlineapplications.org/faq/SecurityBulletins/OPC_Foundation_Security_Bulletin_CVE-2017-12069.pdf)  NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE ('XXE') CWE\\-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By sending specially crafted packets to the OPC Discovery Server at Port 4840/TCP, an attacker might cause the system to access various resources chosen by the attacker.[CVE\\-2017\\-12069](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-12069)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
