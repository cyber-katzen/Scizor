EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.5\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: JT Utilities\nVulnerabilities: Function Call with Incorrect Variable or Reference as Argument, NULL Pointer Dereference\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service condition.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Siemens JT Utilities are affected:\n\nAll versions prior to v13.0.2.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0FUNCTION CALL WITH INCORRECT VARIABLE OR REFERENCE AS ARGUMENT CWE-688\nWhen parsing specially crafted JT files, a hash function is called with an incorrect argument leading the application to crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the application.\nCVE-2021-33713 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nWhen parsing specially crafted JT files, a missing check for the validity of an iterator leads to NULL pointer dereference condition, causing the application to crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the application.\nCVE-2021-33714 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476\nWhen parsing specially crafted JT files, a race condition could cause an object to be released before being operated on, leading to NULL pointer dereference condition and causing the application to crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition in the application.\nCVE-2021-33715 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has identified the following specific mitigations and workarounds users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nUpdate to v13.0.2.0 or later version (login required)\nAvoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in JT Utilities\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, and follow the recommendations in the product manual.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information about this issue, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-209268.\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
