MITIGATIONS--------------- AT\\&T Labs have stated this software is longer supported and recommends vendors to move away from using it. Schneider Electric has released the following version updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities:* EcoStruxure Control Expert [V15\\.1 HF001 or later](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/ControlExpert_V151_HF001/)  .* EcoStruxure Process Expert [V2021 or later](https://www.se.com/myschneider/documentsDownloadCenterDetail/in/en/EPE2021Release)  .* SCADAPack RemoteConnect for [R2\\.7\\.3 or later](https://shop.exchange.se.com/en-US/apps/58663)  (Users no longer need to update the RemoteConnect application when a Control Expert update is present.) Schneider Electric also recommends users take specific measures:* Securely store the project files and restrict access to trusted users.* Use secure communication channels when exchanging files over the network,.* Only open project files received from trusted sources.* Compute a hash of the project files and regularly check the consistency of this hash to verify integrity before usage.* Harden the workstation running EcoStruxure Control Expert or Unity Pro.* Users using Unity Pro should consider migrating to EcoStruxure Control Expert.* Harden the workstation running EcoStruxure Process Expert.* Harden the workstation running SCADAPackRemoteConnect for x70 See the [Schneider Electric Security Notification, number SEVD\\-2021\\-222\\-02](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2021-222-02/)  for more information. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
