MITIGATIONS\nAT&T Labs have stated this software is longer supported and recommends vendors to move away from using it.\u00a0\nSchneider Electric has released the following version updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities:\u00a0\n\nEcoStruxure Control Expert V15.1 HF001 or later.\u00a0\nEcoStruxure Process Expert V2021 or later.\u00a0\nSCADAPack RemoteConnect for R2.7.3 or later (Users no longer need to update the RemoteConnect application when a Control Expert update is present.)\u00a0\n\nSchneider Electric also recommends users take specific measures:\u00a0\n\nSecurely store the project files and restrict access to trusted users.\u00a0\nUse secure communication channels when exchanging files over the network,.\u00a0\nOnly open project files received from trusted sources.\u00a0\nCompute a hash of the project files and regularly check the consistency of this hash to verify integrity before usage.\u00a0\nHarden the workstation running EcoStruxure Control Expert or Unity Pro.\u00a0\nUsers using Unity Pro should consider migrating to EcoStruxure Control Expert.\u00a0\nHarden the workstation running EcoStruxure Process Expert.\u00a0\nHarden the workstation running SCADAPackRemoteConnect for x70\u00a0\n\nSee the Schneider Electric Security Notification, number SEVD-2021-222-02 for more information.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
