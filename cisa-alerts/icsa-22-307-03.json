EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 8.1\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Delta Industrial Automation\u00a0\nEquipment: DIALink\u00a0\nVulnerability: Path traversal\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to place malicious code on the target device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nDelta Industrial Automation reports this vulnerability affects the following DIALink products:\u00a0\n\nDIALink versions prior to v1.5.0.0 Beta 4\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\nThe software uses an external input to construct a pathname intended to identify a file or directory located underneath a restricted parent directory. However, the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname, which can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.\nCVE-2022-2969 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nY4er, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDelta Industrial Automation has created v1.5.0.0 Beta 4 to address this vulnerability. Delta Industrial Automation will not make this update an official release; users may obtain this updated version via Delta field application engineering (FAEs) or contacting Delta Industrial Automation directly.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely. This vulnerability has a low attack complexity.\n",
