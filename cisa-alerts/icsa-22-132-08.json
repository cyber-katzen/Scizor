UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-22\\-132\\-08 Siemens Industrial Products with OPC UA that was published May 12, 2022, on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ICS.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could crash the device by sending uncertain status code in a response message.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Siemens industrial products are affected:* SIMATIC NET PC Software v14: All versions prior to 14 SP1 Update 14* SIMATIC NET PC Software v15: All versions* SIMATIC NET PC Software v16: All versions prior to 16 Update 6* SIMATIC NET PC Software v17: All versions prior to 17 SP1* SITOP Manager: All versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update C Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels 7\u201d and 15\u201d (including SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to 17 Update 5* SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels 4\u201d to 22\u201d (including SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to 17 Update 5* SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F: All versions prior to 17 Update 5**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update C Part 1 of 3 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** ### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE\\-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html) The OPC UA ANSIC stack (also called Legacy C\\-stack) was reported to crash when an unexpected OPC UA response message status code was accessed via the synchronous Client API. The vulnerability was found in generated code of the OPC Foundation C\\-stack. An unexpected status code in response messages will result in null pointer dereference, leading to a ping\\-of\\-death crash. This affects a client, but it might also affect a server when it uses OpcUa\\_ClientApi\\_RegisterServer (e.g., register at Local Discovery Server). A specially crafted UA server or machine\\-in\\-the\\-middle attacker can cause the OPC UA application to crash by sending uncertain status code in response messages.[CVE\\-2021\\-45117](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-45117)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.5\\.
