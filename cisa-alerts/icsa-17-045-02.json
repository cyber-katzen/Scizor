Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nAUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE-288\n\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified. The existing file system architecture could allow attackers to bypass the access control that may allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2017-5174 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\nIMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND CWE-78\n\nAn improper neutralization of special elements vulnerability has been identified. If special elements are not properly neutralized, an attacker can call multiple parameters that can allow access to the root level operating system which could allow remote code execution.\nCVE-2017-5173 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nFlorent Montel and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cikala discovered the authentication bypass vulnerability, and Davy\u00a0Douhine of RandoriSec discovered the improper access control vulnerability.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Europe, United States, Australia\nCompany Headquarters Location: Windhagen, Germany\n",
