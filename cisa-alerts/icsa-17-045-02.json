[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryGeutebr\u00fcck IP Cameras===================== Last Revised February 14, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-045\\-02### **CVSS v3 9\\.8****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit**Vendor:**  Geutebr\u00fcck**Equipment:**  IP Cameras**Vulnerabilities:**  Authentication Bypass and Improper Neutralization of Special ElementsAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Geutebr\u00fcck G\\-Cam IP camera version is affected:* G\\-Cam/EFD\\-2250 Version 1\\.11\\.0\\.12IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and obtain remote anonymous access to the device; these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.MITIGATION---------- Geutebr\u00fcck recommends customers download and update with the newest patch from this location by registering for a new web club account or logging into an existing account.<http://www.geutebrueck.com/en_EN/login.html> NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[AUTHENTICATION BYPASS USING AN ALTERNATE PATH OR CHANNEL CWE\\-288](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified. The existing file system architecture could allow attackers to bypass the access control that may allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2017\\-5174](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5174)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).[IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An improper neutralization of special elements vulnerability has been identified. If special elements are not properly neutralized, an attacker can call multiple parameters that can allow access to the root level operating system which could allow remote code execution.[CVE\\-2017\\-5173](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5173)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
