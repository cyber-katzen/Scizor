Summary      Description     This CISA submission included one unique file. This file is a malicious loader that contains an embedded executable. This embedded executable is a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that provides a vast array of Command and Control (C2\\) capabilities. These C2 capabilities include the ability to remotely monitor a system's desktop, gain reverse shell access, exfiltrate data, and upload and execute additional payloads. The malware can also function as a proxy, allowing a remote operator to pivot to other systems.

Static analysis of this application reveals it is a RAT that provides a vast array of C2 capabilities to a remote operator, including the ability to log keystrokes, upload and execute additional payloads, function as a proxy, and have graphical user interface (GUI) access over a target Windows system's desktop. During runtime, the malware connects out to its hard coded C2 server 192\\[.]95\\[.]20\\[.]8 on port 443\\. After establishing this connection, the malware sits and waits for data to be sent back to it from the remote C2 server. Static analysis indicates the malware will receive a block of data that contains command data, and a 16\\-byte key. The 16\\-byte key will be extracted from this received data, and utilized to decrypt the command portion. The decrypted command portion of the C2 data will be checked to ensure that its first four bytes are equal to the value 0x0E03882Ah. If the values match, the malware will attempt to process the received decrypted data as a command. If the values do not match, the C2 session will be terminated and the malware will attempt to reinitiate a connection to the C2 server.       The executable is very similar in design and functionality to the file \"f7\\_dump\\_64\\.exe\" (88a5e4b24747648a4e3f0a2d5282b51683260f9208b06788fc858c44559da1e8\\), described in report MAR\\-10382580\\.     Screenshots        **Figure 1 \\-**   This screenshot illustrates the cryptographic algorithm the malware utilizes to secure its inbound and outbound communications with its hard\\-coded C2\\. Communications between this malware and its C2, if collected, may be decrypted by following this algorithm.         **Figure 2 \\-**   This screenshot illustrates the code structure the malware utilizes to decrypt inbound data from the remote C2, and then compare its first four bytes to the value 0x0E03882Ah. The inbound data must contain this value as its first four bytes, after decryption, in order for the C2 session to continue. The 16\\-byte key will be included in the inbound payload from the remote C2\\.         **Figure 3 \\-**   The screenshot illustrates the malware's hard\\-coded C2 server, 192\\[.]95\\[.]20\\[.]8\\.        192\\.95\\.20\\.8     Tags     command\\-and\\-control     Ports   * 443 TCP     Whois     Queried whois.ovh.com with \"ip\\-192\\-95\\-20\\.net\"...

Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
