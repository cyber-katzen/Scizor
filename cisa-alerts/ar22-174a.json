This file is a malicious loader that contains an embedded executable. This embedded executable is a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that provides a vast array of Command and Control (C2) capabilities. These C2 capabilities include the ability to remotely monitor a system's desktop, gain reverse shell access, exfiltrate data, and upload and execute additional payloads. The malware can also function as a proxy, allowing a remote operator to pivot to other systems.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: MAR-10382254-1.v1.stix\nSubmitted Files (2)\n6589a687e69a182e075f11805a755ac1fabbddae1636c6fea8e80e7414521349 (hmsvc.exe)\n6e3840f11aa02f391edd7e3e65b214f1af128fa207b4feb7f69e438014a2206d (658_dump_64.exe)\nIPs (1)\n192.95.20.8\n\nFindings\n\n6589a687e69a182e075f11805a755ac1fabbddae1636c6fea8e80e7414521349\nTags\ntrojan\nDetails\n\n\n\nName\nhmsvc.exe\n\n\nSize\n720384 bytes\n\n\nType\nPE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n\nMD5\ndf81145680b4deab198d9bba091d86e9\n\n\nSHA1\n4235d9a934d26ec688c21e3fc2e470178b7b3c21\n\n\nSHA256\n6589a687e69a182e075f11805a755ac1fabbddae1636c6fea8e80e7414521349\n\n\nSHA512\nde5e8164f58120e624e0546518b5c0c5df864baa9b389162f1be75547e6f684ee94f9df5738cdcf5065dd7bfcd6481c6ea45f4c1ff154edb4e0ad48ea5260d42\n\n\nssdeep\n12288:g5eggD3QpKCvO5yPPGtjLFanfI2YAMinlQZUub+RdYhawaGFbhwydP76N5:ceHD3eKU+tVafVgKlQZUlRdYVdP76N5\n\n\nEntropy\n7.623341\n\n\n\nAntivirus\n\n\n\nAdaware\nGen:Variant.Ulise.345018\n\n\nAhnLab\nTrojan/Win.Generic\n\n\nAvira\nHEUR/AGEN.1248665\n\n\nBitdefender\nGen:Variant.Ulise.345018\n\n\nESET\na variant of Win64/Injector.HA.gen trojan\n\n\nEmsisoft\nGen:Variant.Ulise.345018 (B)\n\n\nIKARUS\nTrojan.Win64.Injector\n\n\n\nYARA Rules\n\nrule CISA_10382580_03 : loader\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meta:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Author = \"CISA Code & Media Analysis\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incident = \"10382580\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date = \"2022-05-02\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last_Modified = \"20220602_1200\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actor = \"n/a\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Category = \"Loader\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Family = \"n/a\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description = \"Detects loader samples\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_1 = \"3764a0f1762a294f662f3bf86bac776f\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_1 = \"f7f7b059b6a7dbd75b30b685b148025a0d4ceceab405e553ca28cacdeae43fab\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_2 = \"21fa1a043460c14709ef425ce24da4fd\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_2 = \"66966ceae7e3a8aace6c27183067d861f9d7267aed30473a95168c3fe19f2c16\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_3 = \"e9c2b8bd1583baf3493824bf7b3ec51e\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_3 = \"7ea294d30903c0ab690bc02b64b20af0cfe66a168d4622e55dee4d6233783751\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_4 = \"de0d57bdc10fee1e1e16e225788bb8de\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_4 = \"33b89b8915aaa59a3c9db23343e8c249b2db260b9b10e88593b6ff2fb5f71d2b\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_5 = \"9b071311ecd1a72bfd715e34dbd1bd77\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_5 = \"3c2c835042a05f8d974d9b35b994bcf8d5a0ce19128ebb362804c2d0f3eb42c0\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MD5_6 = \"05d38bc82d362dd57190e3cb397f807d\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SHA256_6 = \"4cd7efdb1a7ac8c4387c515a7b1925931beb212b95c4f9d8b716dbe18f54624f\"\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0strings:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s0 = { B8 01 00 00 00 48 6B C0 00 C6 44 04 20 A8 B8 01 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s1 = { 00 00 48 6B C0 01 C6 44 04 20 9A B8 01 00 00 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s2 = { 48 6B C0 02 C6 44 04 20 93 B8 01 00 00 00 48 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$s3 = { C0 03 C6 44 04 20 9B B8 01 00 00 00 48 6B C0 }\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0condition:\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all of them\n\t\t\t\t}\n\nssdeep Matches\nNo matches found.\nPE Metadata\n\n\n\nCompile Date\n2016-06-12 12:53:34-04:00\n\n\nImport Hash\n4f2b9ad89041fedc43298c09c8e7b948\n\n\nCompany Name\nSysinternals - www.sysinternals.com\n\n\nFile Description\nLists logon session information\n\n\nInternal Name\nLogonSessions\n\n\nLegal Copyright\nCopyright (C) 2004-2016 Mark Russinovich\n\n\nOriginal Filename\nlogonsessions.exe\n\n\nProduct Name\nSysinternals LogonSessions\n\n\nProduct Version\n1.4\n\n\n\nPE Sections\n\n\n\nMD5\nName\nRaw Size\nEntropy\n\n\ne16f93c6b1a062a1dc2156fc770594a6\nheader\n1024\n2.888609\n\n\nc4466c75f41681629fc2ead156f8de84\n.text\n89088\n6.366960\n\n\n4d9a0bcd9467b5aaee5d4d762219821b\n.rdata\n65536\n4.425938\n\n\nf80417eeab656641c6a5206454b398d3\n.data\n6656\n3.054858\n\n\ne0d2510e666231c532ff97edf51abd10\n.pdata\n5120\n4.855993\n\n\nfff7f8f7be38486e0a6d01bc0472a6f2\n.rsrc\n550912\n7.914631\n\n\nbca539afcd691a4a238b78fc830dc55a\n.reloc\n2048\n4.939573\n\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\n6589a687e6...\nConnected_To\n192.95.20.8\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis malware is a 64-bit Windows loader that contains an encrypted malicious executable.

Static analysis of this application reveals it is a RAT that provides a vast array of C2 capabilities to a remote operator, including the ability to log keystrokes, upload and execute additional payloads, function as a proxy, and have graphical user interface (GUI) access over a target Windows system's desktop. During runtime, the malware connects out to its hard coded C2 server 192[.]95[.]20[.]8 on port 443. After establishing this connection, the malware sits and waits for data to be sent back to it from the remote C2 server. Static analysis indicates the malware will receive a block of data that contains command data, and a 16-byte key. The 16-byte key will be extracted from this received data, and utilized to decrypt the command portion. The decrypted command portion of the C2 data will be checked to ensure that its first four bytes are equal to the value 0x0E03882Ah. If the values match, the malware will attempt to process the received decrypted data as a command. If the values do not match, the C2 session will be terminated and the malware will attempt to reinitiate a connection to the C2 server.\n\n\t\t\tThe executable is very similar in design and functionality to the file \"f7_dump_64.exe\" (88a5e4b24747648a4e3f0a2d5282b51683260f9208b06788fc858c44559da1e8), described in report MAR-10382580.\nScreenshots\n \n\nFigure 1 - This screenshot illustrates the cryptographic algorithm the malware utilizes to secure its inbound and outbound communications with its hard-coded C2. Communications between this malware and its C2, if collected, may be decrypted by following this algorithm.\n\n \n\nFigure 2 - This screenshot illustrates the code structure the malware utilizes to decrypt inbound data from the remote C2, and then compare its first four bytes to the value 0x0E03882Ah. The inbound data must contain this value as its first four bytes, after decryption, in order for the C2 session to continue. The 16-byte key will be included in the inbound payload from the remote C2.\n\n \n\nFigure 3 - The screenshot illustrates the malware's hard-coded C2 server, 192[.]95[.]20[.]8.\n\n\n\n192.95.20.8\nTags\ncommand-and-control\nPorts\n\n443 TCP\n\nWhois\nQueried whois.ovh.com with \"ip-192-95-20.net\"...\n\n\t\t\tDomain Name: ip-192-95-20.net\n\t\t\tRegistry Domain ID: 1765585340_DOMAIN_NET-VRSN\n\t\t\tRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.ovh.com\n\t\t\tRegistrar URL: https://www.ovh.com\n\t\t\tUpdated Date: 2021-12-01T02:56:46.0Z\n\t\t\tCreation Date: 2012-12-11T13:59:05.0Z\n\t\t\tRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2022-12-11T13:59:05.0Z\n\t\t\tRegistrar: OVH, SAS\n\t\t\tRegistrar IANA ID: 433\n\t\t\tRegistrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@ovh.net\n\t\t\tRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +33.972101007\n\t\t\tDomain Status: clientDeleteProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited\n\t\t\tDomain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited\n\t\t\tRegistry Registrant ID:\n\t\t\tRegistrant Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant Organization: Hebergement OVH Inc.\n\t\t\tRegistrant Street: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant City: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant State/Province:\n\t\t\tRegistrant Postal Code: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant Country: CA\n\t\t\tRegistrant Phone: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant Phone Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant Fax: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tRegistrant Fax Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tSend message to contact by visiting https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/lp/request-ovhcloud-registered-domain/\n\t\t\tRegistrant Email: 45oplxny9ljiuizg7k3l@w.o-w-o.info\n\t\t\tRegistry Admin ID:\n\t\t\tAdmin Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Organization: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Street: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin City: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin State/Province: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Postal Code: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Country: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Phone: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Phone Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Fax: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tAdmin Fax Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tSend message to contact by visiting https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/lp/request-ovhcloud-registered-domain/\n\t\t\tAdmin Email: t0xyeloj2uxkh9uyhhjh@y.o-w-o.info\n\t\t\tRegistry Tech ID:\n\t\t\tTech Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Organization: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Street: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech City: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech State/Province: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Postal Code: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Country: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Phone: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Phone Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Fax: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tTech Fax Ext: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\n\t\t\tSend message to contact by visiting https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/lp/request-ovhcloud-registered-domain/\n\t\t\tTech Email: t0xyeloj2uxkh9uyhhjh@y.o-w-o.info\n\t\t\tName Server: dns10.ovh.ca\n\t\t\tName Server: ns10.ovh.ca\n\t\t\tDNSSEC: unsigned\n\t\t\tURL of the ICANN WHOIS Data Problem Reporting System:\nhttp://wdprs.internic.net/\nRelationships\n\n\n\n192.95.20.8\nConnected_From\n6589a687e69a182e075f11805a755ac1fabbddae1636c6fea8e80e7414521349\n\n\n\nDescription\nThe malware attempts to connect to this Internet Protocol (IP) address.\n\nRelationship Summary\n\n\n\n\n6589a687e6...\nConnected_To\n192.95.20.8\n\n\n192.95.20.8\nConnected_From\n6589a687e69a182e075f11805a755ac1fabbddae1636c6fea8e80e7414521349\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
