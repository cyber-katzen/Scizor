This would force the vendor daemon to shut down. The vulnerability could also allow remote code execution. No exploit of this vulnerability has been demonstrated.[CVE\\-2018\\-20033](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-20033)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Flexera recommends all users using affected versions of FlexNet Publisher upgrade to Version 2018 R4 or newer as soon as possible. The updates can be obtained with a customer account at the following location (login required):[https://flexerasoftware.flexnetoperations.com/control/inst/login?nextURL\\=%2Fcontrol%2Finst%2Findex](https://flexerasoftware.flexnetoperations.com/control/inst/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Finst%2Findex)  More information on this issue can be found at the following location on the Flexera site:[https://community.flexera.com/t5/FlexNet\\-Publisher\\-News/FlexNet\\-Publisher\\-2018\\-R4\\-SP1\\-is\\-now\\-available/ba\\-p/95063/jump\\-to/first\\-unread\\-message](https://community.flexera.com/t5/FlexNet-Publisher-News/FlexNet-Publisher-2018-R4-SP1-is-now-available/ba-p/95063/jump-to/first-unread-message)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
