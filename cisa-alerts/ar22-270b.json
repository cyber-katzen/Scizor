When executed, it prompts the attacker to enter the shell command to be executed. It checks whether the command supplied by the attacker through the \"cmd\" parameters contain null values (blank). If it contains null values, the command input stream will be displayed in a JSP page in the format below:\n\n\t\t\t--Begin format--\n\t\t\t\"\"Command: \" + request.getParameter(\"cmd\") + \"<BR>\"\"\n\t\t\t--End format--\n\n\t\t\tIf the system platform is Windows, it executes the user-provided commands via \"cmd.exe /c <commands>\". Otherwise, it will execute the user-provided commands in the shell. The command output will be displayed in a JSP page.\nScreenshots\n \n\nFigure 1 - The contents of the JSP file. It contains a form with input fields that prompts the attacker to enter the command in the input box to execute.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\nContact Information\n\n\n1-888-282-0870\nCISA Central\u00a0(UNCLASS)\nCISA SIPR (SIPRNET)\nCISA IC (JWICS)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.

A Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) is intended to provide organizations with malware analysis in a timely manner. In most instances this report will provide initial indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\nWhat is a MAR? A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is intended to provide organizations with more detailed malware analysis acquired via manual reverse engineering. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\nCan I edit this document? This document is not to be edited in any way by recipients. All comments or questions related to this document should be directed to the CISA at 1-888-282-0870 or CISA Central.\nCan I submit malware to CISA? Malware samples can be submitted via three methods:\n\nWeb: https://malware.us-cert.gov\nE-Mail: submit@malware.us-cert.gov\nFTP: ftp.malware.us-cert.gov (anonymous)\n\nCISA encourages you to report any suspicious activity, including cybersecurity incidents, possible malicious code, software vulnerabilities, and phishing-related scams.
