This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR and is configurable with the \\-\\-prefix / \\-\\-openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1\\.1\\.0 and 1\\.1\\.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix\\-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such find themselves looking at sub\\-directories of 'C:/usr/local'; these may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1\\.0\\.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1\\.0\\.2 encourage users to specify their own \\-\\-prefix. OpenSSL versions 1\\.1\\.1, 1\\.1\\.0 and 1\\.0\\.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments, this has been assessed as low severity; therefore, Siemens is not creating new releases at this time.

Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or man\\-in\\-the\\-middle attacker) could overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory.

MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens released updates for the affected product and recommends updating to the latest version:* [Update to V3\\.2\\.7 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109814809/)  . Siemens identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations customers can apply to reduce the risk:* Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only.* Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' [operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following the recommendations in the product manuals. Siemens provides [additional information on industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  .

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .
