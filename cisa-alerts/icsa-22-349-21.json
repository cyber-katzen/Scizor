A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).\u00a0\n3.2.78\u00a0INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732\u00a0\nThe process_open function in sftp-server.c in OpenSSH before 7.6 does not properly prevent write operations in readonly mode, which could allow attackers to create zero-length files.\u00a0\nCVE-2017-15906 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.79\u00a0INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863\u00a0\nIn OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client could allow remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename, modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.\u00a0\nCVE-2018-20685 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.80\u00a0IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295\u00a0\nOpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file and certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local'; these may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage users to specify their own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments, this has been assessed as low severity; therefore, Siemens is not creating new releases at this time. This vulnerability is fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c), OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k), and OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).\u00a0\nCVE-2019-1552 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.81\u00a0IMPROPER ENCODING OR ESCAPING OF OUTPUT CWE-116\u00a0\nAn issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or man-in-the-middle attacker) could employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.\u00a0\nCVE-2019-6109 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.82\u00a0INAPPROPRIATE ENCODING FOR OUTPUT CONTEXT CWE-838\u00a0\nIn OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or man-in-the-middle attacker) could manipulate the client output (for example, to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred).\u00a0\nCVE-2019-6110 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.83\u00a0IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22\u00a0\nAn issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or man-in-the-middle attacker) could overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\u00a0\nCVE-2019-6111 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA\u00a0\n4.
