This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR and is configurable with the \\-\\-prefix / \\-\\-openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1\\.1\\.0 and 1\\.1\\.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix\\-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such find themselves looking at sub\\-directories of 'C:/usr/local'; these may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1\\.0\\.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1\\.0\\.2 encourage users to specify their own \\-\\-prefix. OpenSSL versions 1\\.1\\.1, 1\\.1\\.0 and 1\\.0\\.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments, this has been assessed as low severity; therefore, Siemens is not creating new releases at this time.
