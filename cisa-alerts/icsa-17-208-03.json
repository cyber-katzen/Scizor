Public exploits are available\n \n\n\n\n**Vendor:** \n PDQ Manufacturing, Inc.\n \n\n\n\n**Equipment:** \n LaserWash, Laser Jet and ProTouch\n \n\n\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** \n Improper Authentication, Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following versions of LaserWash, Laser Jet, and ProTouch, in\\-bay automatic car wash systems are affected:\n \n\n\n* LaserWash G5 and G5 S Series all versions,\n* LaserWash M5, all versions,\n* LaserWash 360 and 360 Plus, all versions,\n* LaserWash AutoXpress and AutoExpress Plus, all versions,\n* LaserJet, all versions,\n* ProTouch Tandem, all versions,\n* ProTouch ICON, all versions, and\n* ProTouch AutoGloss, all versions.\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected system and to issue unexpected commands to impact the intended operation of the system.\n \n\n\nMITIGATION\n----------\n\n\n\n PDQ Manufacturing, Inc. (\u201cPDQ\u201d) has validated the vulnerabilities and is developing product fixes for the affected systems. In the interim, PDQ. has identified compensating controls to limit the exploitability of the affected systems.\n \n\n\n\n PDQ recommends that users apply the following controls:\n \n\n\n* Always make sure any PDQ equipment is not accessible from the Internet; it should be behind a secure firewall.\n* Whenever a machine or router is received and installed, always change the default password from the factory settings to a new password unique to the machine. If an existing site is still using the factory default passwords on a machine or router, immediately change the default password to a new, unique, strong password.\n* Always set up the system network (router or Wi\\-Fi) with its security features enabled such that they require a username and password to be able to access the machine network.\n* Do not set up the site router with \u201cport forwarding\u201d enabled. This can effectively expose the system to the Internet and may permit an unauthorized person to reach the machine login screen.\n* Do not share passwords or write them down in an accessible place where unauthorized users may find them.\n\n\n\n NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n \n\n\n* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\n* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n \n\n\n\n ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n----------------------\n\n\n\n[IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n Affected web\\-server does not properly verify that provided authentication information is correct.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-9630](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-9630) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
