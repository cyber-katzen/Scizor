EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Siemens* **Equipment**  : Teamcenter Visualization, JT2Go* **Vulnerability**  : Out\\-of\\-bounds Read2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products of Siemens, are affected:* Siemens JT2Go: Versions prior to v14\\.3\\.0\\.8* Siemens Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.1: Versions prior to v14\\.1\\.0\\.14* Siemens Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.2: Versions prior to v14\\.2\\.0\\.10* Siemens Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.3: Versions prior to v14\\.3\\.0\\.8* Siemens Teamcenter Visualization V2312: Versions prior to v2312\\.0002### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview#### **3\\.2\\.1** [**OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-7066](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-7066)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER MoyunSec reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Siemens recommends users update the follow products to the latest versions:* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.1: Update to [V14\\.1\\.0\\.14 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.2: Update to [V14\\.2\\.0\\.10 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* JT2Go: Update to [V14\\.3\\.0\\.8 or later version](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/plmcomponents/jt/jt2go/)* Teamcenter Visualization V14\\.3: Update to [V14\\.3\\.0\\.8 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)* Teamcenter Visualization V2312: Update to [V2312\\.0002 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/) Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:* All affected products: Do not open untrusted PDF files in affected applications. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security)  and following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)  For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA\\-722010 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-722010.html)  and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-722010.json)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.5\\.
