EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: Teamcenter Visualization, JT2Go\nVulnerability: Out-of-bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of Siemens, are affected:\n\nSiemens JT2Go: Versions prior to v14.3.0.8\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V14.1: Versions prior to v14.1.0.14\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V14.2: Versions prior to v14.2.0.10\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V14.3: Versions prior to v14.3.0.8\nSiemens Teamcenter Visualization V2312: Versions prior to v2312.0002\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-7066 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMoyunSec reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update the follow products to the latest versions:\n\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.1: Update to V14.1.0.14 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.2: Update to V14.2.0.10 or later version\nJT2Go: Update to V14.3.0.8 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V14.3: Update to V14.3.0.8 or later version\nTeamcenter Visualization V2312: Update to V2312.0002 or later version\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:\n\nAll affected products: Do not open untrusted PDF files in affected applications.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage\nFor more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-722010 in HTML and CSAF.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJuly 11, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
