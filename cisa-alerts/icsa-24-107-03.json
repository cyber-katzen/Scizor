EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 9.2\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: ControlLogix 5580, GuardLogix 5580, CompactLogix 5380, 1756-EN4TR\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF) resulting in the product to become unavailable.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and GuardLogix, programmable logic controllers, are affected:\n\nControlLogix 5580: Version V35.011\nGuardLogix 5580: Version V35.011\nCompactLogix 5380: Version V35.011\n1756-EN4TR: Version V5.001\nCompact GuardLogix 5380: V35.011\nControlLogix 5580 Process: V35.011\nCompactLogix 5380 Process: V35.011\nCompactLogix 5480: V35.011\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA specific malformed fragmented packet type (fragmented packets may be generated automatically by devices that send large amounts of data) can cause a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF). If exploited, the affected product will become unavailable and require a manual restart to recover it. Additionally, an MNRF could result in a loss of view and/or control of connected devices.\nCVE-2024-3493 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3493 . A base score of 9.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released product updates addressing this vulnerability:\n\nControlLogix 5580: Update to version V35.013 or V36.011\nGuardLogix 5580: Update to version V35.013 or V36.011\nCompactLogix 5380: Update to version V35.013 or V36.011\n1756-EN4TR: Update to version V6.001\nCompact GuardLogix 5380: Update to version V35.013, V36.011 and later\nControlLogix 5580 Process: Update to version V35.013, V36.011 and later\nCompactLogix 5380 Process: Update to version V35.013, V36.011 and later\nCompactLogix 5480: Update to version V35.013, V36.011 and later\n\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation's security advisory (Login required).\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
