EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Sielco\nEquipment: Analog FM Transmitters and Radio Link\nVulnerabilities: Improper Access Control, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Privilege Defined with Unsafe Actions\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to escalate privileges, access restricted pages, or hijack sessions.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Sielco devices are affected:\n\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.12 (EXC5000GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.12 (EXC120GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.11 (EXC300GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.10 (EXC1600GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.10 (EXC2000GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.08 (EXC1600GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.08 (EXC1000GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.07 (EXC3000GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 2.06 (EXC5000GX)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.7.7 (EXC30GT)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.7.4 (EXC300GT)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.7.4 (EXC100GT)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.7.4 (EXC5000GT)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.6.3 (EXC1000GT)\nAnalog FM transmitter: 1.5.4 (EXC120GT)\nRadio Link: 2.06 (RTX19)\nRadio Link: 2.05 (RTX19)\nRadio Link: 2.00 (EXC19)\nRadio Link: 1.60 (RTX19)\nRadio Link: 1.59 (RTX19)\nRadio Link: 1.55 (EXC19)\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Improper Access Control CWE-284\nThe cookie session ID is of insufficient length and can be exploited by brute force, which may allow a remote attacker to obtain a valid session, bypass authentication, and manipulate the transmitter.\nCVE-2023-42769\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0Cross-Site Request Forgery CWE-352\nThe application interface allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform certain actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious web site.\nCVE-2023-45317\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0Improper Access Control CWE-284\nThe application suffers from improper access control when editing users. A user with read permissions can manipulate users, passwords, and permissions by sending a single HTTP POST request with modified parameters.\nCVE-2023-45228\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions CWE-267\nThe application suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability. A user with read permissions can elevate privileges by sending a HTTP POST to set a parameter.\nCVE-2023-41966\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0Italy\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCISA discovered public proof of concept of these vulnerabilities as authored by Gjoko Krstic of ZeroScience.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSielco has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of affected versions of Sielco PolyEco FM Transmitter are invited to contact Sielco\u00a0customer support\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nExercise principles of least privilege.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\n5.
