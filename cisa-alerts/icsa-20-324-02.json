EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Paradox* **Equipment:**  IP150* **Vulnerabilities:**  Stack\\-based Buffer Overflow, Classic Buffer Overflow2\\. UPDATE INFORMATION---------------------- This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSMA\\-20\\-324\\-02 Paradox IP150 that was published November 17, 2021, to the ICS webpage at www.cisa.gov/uscert.3\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code, which may result in the termination of the physical security system.4\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 4\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Paradox IP150 are affected:**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Paradox IP150: All firmware versions**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** * Paradox IP150 firmware Version 5\\.02\\.09### 4\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 4\\.2\\.1 [STACK\\-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE\\-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.htmlhttps:/cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html) The affected product is vulnerable to three stack\\-based buffer overflows, which may allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2020\\-25189](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25189)  has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 4\\.2\\.2 [BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE\\-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.htmlhttps:/cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html) The affected product is vulnerable to five post\\-authentication buffer overflows, which may allow a logged in user to remotely execute arbitrary code.[CVE\\-2020\\-25185](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25185)  has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 4\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple Sectors* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 4\\.4 RESEARCHER Omri Ben\\-Bassat of Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.5\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Contact Paradox support for mitigation details via email at [support@paradox.com](mailto:support@paradox.com)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Ensure the least\\-privilege user principle is followed.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
