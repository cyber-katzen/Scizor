These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are releasing this joint CSA to provide information on the \u201cDaixin Team,\u201d a cybercrime group that is actively targeting U.S. businesses, predominantly in the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector, with ransomware and data extortion operations.\nThis joint CSA provides TTPs and IOCs of Daixin actors obtained from FBI threat response activities and third-party reporting.\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n\nStopransomware Daixin Team\n(PDF,       560.58 KB\n  )\n\n\nDownload the IOCs:\u00a0\n\n\nAA22-294A STIX\n(XML,       23.22 KB\n  )\n\n\nTechnical Details\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae for Enterprise framework, version 11. See MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.\nCybercrime actors routinely target HPH Sector organizations with ransomware:\n\nAs of October 2022, per FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) data, specifically victim reports across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the HPH Sector accounts for 25 percent of ransomware complaints.\nAccording to an IC3 annual report in 2021, 649 ransomware reports were made across 14 critical infrastructure sectors; the HPH Sector accounted for the most reports at 148.\n\nThe Daixin Team is a ransomware and data extortion group that has targeted the HPH Sector with ransomware and data extortion operations since at least June 2022. Since then, Daixin Team cybercrime actors have caused ransomware incidents at multiple HPH Sector organizations where they have:\n\nDeployed ransomware to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services\u2014including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services, and/or\nExfiltrated personal identifiable information (PII) and patient health information (PHI) and threatened to release the information if a ransom is not paid.\n\nDaixin actors gain initial access to victims through virtual private network (VPN) servers. In one confirmed compromise, the actors likely exploited an unpatched vulnerability in the organization\u2019s VPN server [T1190]. In another confirmed compromise, the actors used previously compromised credentials to access a legacy VPN server [T1078] that did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. The actors are believed to have acquired the VPN credentials through the use of a phishing email with a malicious attachment [T1598.002].\nAfter obtaining access to the victim\u2019s VPN server, Daixin actors move laterally via Secure Shell (SSH) [T1563.001] and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1563.002]. Daixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through credential dumping [T1003] and pass the hash [T1550.002]. The actors have leveraged privileged accounts to gain access to VMware vCenter Server and reset account passwords [T1098] for ESXi servers in the environment. The actors have then used SSH to connect to accessible ESXi servers and deploy ransomware [T1486] on those servers.\u00a0\nAccording to third-party reporting, the Daixin Team\u2019s ransomware is based on leaked Babuk Locker source code. This third-party reporting as well as FBI analysis show that the ransomware targets ESXi servers and encrypts files located in /vmfs/volumes/ with the following extensions: .vmdk, .vmem, .vswp, .vmsd, .vmx, and .vmsn. A ransom note is also written to /vmfs/volumes/. See Figure 1 for targeted file system path and Figure 2 for targeted file extensions list. Figure 3 and Figure 4 include examples of ransom notes. Note that in the Figure 3 ransom note, Daixin actors misspell \u201cDaixin\u201d as \u201cDaxin.\u201d\n\nFigure 1: Daixin Team \u2013 Ransomware Targeted File Path\n\nFigure 2: Daixin Team \u2013 Ransomware Targeted File Extensions\n\nFigure 3: Example 1 of Daixin Team Ransomware Note\n\nFigure 4: Example 2 of Daixin Team Ransomware Note\nIn addition to deploying ransomware, Daixin actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] from victim systems. In one confirmed compromise, the actors used Rclone\u2014an open-source program to manage files on cloud storage\u2014to exfiltrate data to a dedicated virtual private server (VPS). In another compromise, the actors used Ngrok\u2014a reverse proxy tool for proxying an internal service out onto an Ngrok domain\u2014for data exfiltration [T1567].\nMITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES\nSee Table 1 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques included in this advisory.\nTable 1: Daixin Actors\u2019 ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise\n\n\n\n\nReconnaissance\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nPhishing for Information: Spearphishing Attachment\n\n\nT1598.002\n\n\nDaixin actors have acquired the VPN credentials (later used for initial access) by a phishing email with a malicious attachment.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Access\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application\n\n\nT1190\n\n\nDaixin actors exploited an unpatched vulnerability in a VPN server to gain initial access to a network.\n\n\n\n\nValid Accounts\n\n\nT1078\n\n\nDaixin actors use previously compromised credentials to access servers on the target network.\n\n\n\n\nPersistence\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nAccount Manipulation\n\n\nT1098\n\n\nDaixin actors have leveraged privileged accounts to reset account passwords for VMware ESXi servers in the compromised environment.\n\n\n\n\nCredential Access\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nOS Credential Dumping\n\n\nT1003\n\n\nDaixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through credential dumping.\n\n\n\n\nLateral Movement\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nRemote Service Session Hijacking: SSH Hijacking\n\n\nT1563.001\n\n\nDaixin actors use SSH and RDP to move laterally across a network.\n\n\n\n\nRemote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking\n\n\nT1563.002\n\n\nDaixin actors use RDP to move laterally across a network.\n\n\n\n\nUse Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash\n\n\nT1550.002\n\n\nDaixin actors have sought to gain privileged account access through pass the hash.\n\n\n\n\nExfiltration\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nExfiltration Over Web Service\n\n\nT1567\n\n\nDaixin Team members have used Ngrok for data exfiltration over web servers.\n\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\n\nID\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\nData Encrypted for Impact\n\n\nT1486\n\n\nDaixin actors have encrypted data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.\n\n\n\n\nINDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\nSee Table 2 for IOCs obtained from third-party reporting.\nTable 2: Daixin Team IOCs \u2013 Rclone Associated SHA256 Hashes\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nSHA256\n\n\n\n\nrclone-v1.59.2-windows-amd64\\git-log.txt\n\n\n9E42E07073E03BDEA4CD978D9E7B44A9574972818593306BE1F3DCFDEE722238\n\n\n\n\nrclone-v1.59.2-windows-amd64\\rclone.1\n\n\n19ED36F063221E161D740651E6578D50E0D3CACEE89D27A6EBED4AB4272585BD\n\n\n\n\nrclone-v1.59.2-windows-amd64\\rclone.exe\n\n\n54E3B5A2521A84741DC15810E6FED9D739EB8083CB1FE097CB98B345AF24E939\n\n\n\n\nrclone-v1.59.2-windows-amd64\\README.html\n\n\nEC16E2DE3A55772F5DFAC8BF8F5A365600FAD40A244A574CBAB987515AA40CBF\n\n\n\n\nrclone-v1.59.2-windows-amd64\\README.txt\n\n\n475D6E80CF4EF70926A65DF5551F59E35B71A0E92F0FE4DD28559A9DEBA60C28\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigations\n\nFBI, CISA, and HHS urge HPH Sector organizations to implement the following to protect against Daixin and related malicious activity:\n\nInstall updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are released. Prioritize patching VPN servers, remote access software, virtual machine software, and known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite the process.\nRequire phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible\u2014particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.\nIf you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure and monitor it.\n\nLimit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private network (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.\nEnsure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable ports and protocols that are not being used for business purposes (e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\n\n\nTurn off SSH and other network device management interfaces such as Telnet, Winbox, and HTTP for wide area networks (WANs) and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled.\nImplement and enforce multi-layer network segmentation with the most critical communications and data resting on the most secure and reliable layer.\nLimit access to data by deploying public key infrastructure and digital certificates to authenticate connections with the network, Internet of Things (IoT) medical devices, and the electronic health record system, as well as to ensure data packages are not manipulated while in transit from man-in-the-middle attacks.\nUse standard user accounts on internal systems instead of\u202fadministrative\u202faccounts, which allow for overarching administrative system privileges and do not ensure least privilege.\nSecure PII/PHI at collection points and encrypt the data at rest and in transit by using technologies such as Transport Layer Security (TPS). Only store personal patient data on internal systems that are protected by firewalls, and ensure extensive backups are available if data is ever compromised.\nProtect stored data by masking the permanent account number (PAN) when it is displayed and rendering it unreadable when it is stored\u2014through cryptography, for example.\nSecure the collection, storage, and processing practices for PII and PHI, per regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Implementing HIPAA security measures can prevent the introduction of malware on the system.\nUse monitoring tools to observe whether IoT devices are behaving erratically due to a compromise.\nCreate and regularly review internal policies that regulate the collection, storage, access, and monitoring of PII/PHI.\nIn addition, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations, including HPH Sector organizations, to apply the following recommendations to prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents.\n\nPreparing for Ransomware\n\nMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration. These practices safeguard an organization\u2019s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident and protect against data losses.\n\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization\u2019s data infrastructure.\n\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated communications plan that includes response procedures for a ransomware incident.\n\nOrganizations should also ensure their incident response and communications plans include response and notification procedures for data breach incidents. Ensure the notification procedures adhere to applicable state laws.\n\nRefer to applicable state data breach laws and consult legal counsel when necessary.\nFor breaches involving electronic health information, you may need to notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Department of Health and Human Services, and\u2014in some cases\u2014the media. Refer to the FTC\u2019s Health Breach Notification Rule and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Breach Notification Rule for more information.\n\n\nSee CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide and CISA Fact Sheet, Protecting Sensitive and Personal Information from Ransomware-Caused Data Breaches, for information on creating a ransomware response checklist and planning and responding to ransomware-caused data breaches.\n\n\n\nMitigating and Preventing Ransomware\n\nRestrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to execute known and permitted programs.\nOpen document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from running.\nImplement user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spearphishing emails.\nUse strong passwords and avoid reusing passwords for multiple accounts. See CISA Tip Choosing and Protecting Passwords and the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines for more information.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\nAudit user accounts with administrative or elevated privileges and configure access controls with least privilege in mind.\nInstall and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software on all hosts.\nOnly use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a VPN.\nConsider adding an email banner to messages coming from outside your organizations.\nDisable hyperlinks in received emails.\n\nResponding to Ransomware Incidents\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:\n\nFollow your organization\u2019s Ransomware Response Checklist (see Preparing for Ransomware section).\nScan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing backups to potential compromise.\nFollow the notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response plan.\nReport incidents to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office, CISA at cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) at a USSS Field Office.\nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nNote: FBI, CISA, and HHS strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.\nREFERENCES\n\nStopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for ransomware resources and alerts.\nResource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nNo-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment.\nOngoing Threat Alerts and Sector alerts are produced by the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) and can be found at hhs.gov/HC3.\nFor additional best practices for Healthcare cybersecurity issues see the HHS 405(d) Aligning Health Care Industry Security Approaches at 405d.hhs.gov\u00a0\n\nREPORTING\nThe FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Daixin Group actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or CISA at cisa.gov/report.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFBI, CISA, and HHS would like to thank CrowdStrike and the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC) for their contributions to this CSA.\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided \u201cas is\u201d for informational purposes only.
