EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Baker Hughes - Bently Nevada\nEquipment: Bently Nevada 3500 System\nVulnerabilities: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information and gain access to the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of the Bently Nevada 3500 System, a real-time monitoring solution, are affected:\n\nBently Nevada 3500 Rack (TDI Firmware): version 5.05\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nBaker Hughes \u2013 Bently Nevada 3500 System TDI Firmware version 5.05 has a vulnerability in their password retrieval functionality which could be used by an attacker to access passwords stored on the device.\nCVE-2023-34437\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nBaker Hughes \u2013 Bently Nevada 3500 System TDI Firmware version 5.05 authentication secrets, used with the Connect Password, are passed in cleartext with every request to the device. An attacker could steal the authentication secret from communication traffic to the device and reuse it for arbitrary requests.\nCVE-2023-34441\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).\n3.2.3\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY CAPTURE-REPLAY CWE-294\nBaker Hughes \u2013 Bently Nevada 3500 System TDI Firmware version 5.05 accepts out-of-sequence messages from older communications. This could allow an attacker to replay older captured packets of traffic to the device to gain access.\nCVE-2023-36857\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nDiego Zaffaroni of Nozomi Networks reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nBaker Hughes \u2013 Bently Nevada recommends that users follow their hardening guidelines to reduce the risk of exploitation. Customers who have registered for access to Baker Hughes DAM may directly access the hardening guideline at\u00a0https://dam.bakerhughes.com/media/?mediaId=32F7FC2F-9F22-4C69-BB847565B7834D08.\nFor customers that do not have access to Baker Hughes DAM may send an email to\u00a0bentlysupport@bakerhughes.com\u00a0to request document 106M9733.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
