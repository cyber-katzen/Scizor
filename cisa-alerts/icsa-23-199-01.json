EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\u00a0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\u00a0\u00a0\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\u00a0\nEquipment: Kinetix 5700\u00a0\nVulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of Rockwell Automation Kinetix 5700 DC Bus Power Supply is affected:\n\n\n\u00a0Kinetix 5700: V13.001\n\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400\nThe Kinetix 5700 DC Bus Power Supply Series A is vulnerable to CIP fuzzing. The new ENIP connections cannot be established if impacted by this vulnerability, which prohibits operational capabilities of the device resulting in a denial-of-service attack.\nCVE-2023-2263 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nRockwell Automation has released the following mitigations and workarounds. Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations below, if possible.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUpgrade to V13.003 or later which has been patched to mitigate these issues.\nFor information on how to mitigate security risks on industrial automation control systems (IACS) networks see the following publications:\n\nSystem Security Design Guidelines Reference Manual publication, SECURE-RM001\nConfigure System Security Features User Manual, SECURE-UM001\n\n\nRockwell Automation encourages users to implement their suggested security best practices to minimize risk of the vulnerability.\n\nFor more information, see Rockwell Automation\u2019s Security Advisory.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
