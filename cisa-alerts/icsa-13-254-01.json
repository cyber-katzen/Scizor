Researcher Eireann Leverett of IOActive coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability with Siemens. Siemens has produced a firmware update that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:\n\nSCALANCE X-200 switch family with firmware version prior to V5.0.0.\n\nAlternatively, the affected products may be identified by using their Machine-Readable Product Designation (MLFB). Products with the following MLFBs are affected:\n\n6GK5224-0BA00-2AA3\n6GK5216-0BA00-2AA3\n6GK5212-2BB00-2AA3\n6GK5212-2BC00-2AA3\n6GK5208-0BA10-2AA3\n6GK5206-1BB10-2AA3\n6GK5206-1BC10-2AA3\n6GK5204-2BB10-2AA3\n6GK5204-2BC10-2AA3\n6GK5208-0HA10-2AA6\n6GK5204-0BA00-2AF2\n6GK5208-0BA00-2AF2\n6GK5206-1BC00-2AF2\n6GK5204-2BC00-2AF2\n6GK5204-2BB10-2CA2.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow attackers to hijack Web sessions over the network without authentication.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors.\nThe affected products, SCALANCE X-200 switches, are used to connect industrial components such as PLCs or HMIs. These switches use a Web-based interface that enables administrators to change device configuration using an Internet browser.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nINSUFFICIENT ENTROPYCWE-331: Insufficient Entropy, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331.html, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013.\n\nThe authentication of the integrated Web server of SCALANCE X-200 switches might allow attackers to hijack Web sessions over the network without authentication because of insufficient entropy in its random number generator.\n\n\nCVE-2013-5709NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-5709 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013.\n\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens has produced a new version of SCALANCE X-200 firmware, V5.0.0. This new version fixes the Web hijack vulnerability. Users may obtain a copy of V5.0.0 at the following location on the Siemens Web site:\nhttp://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/de/78458674\nSiemens security advisory is located here:http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-850708.pdf\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,\u00a0that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nIn addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not click Web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013.\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013.\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n",
