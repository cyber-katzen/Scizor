[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySiemens SCALANCE X\\-200 Web Hijack Vulnerability================================================ Last Revised August 29, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-254\\-01OVERVIEW-------- Siemens has identified a Web hijack vulnerability in the SCALANCE X\\-200 switch product family. Researcher Eireann Leverett of IOActive coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability with Siemens. Siemens has produced a firmware update that mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:* SCALANCE X\\-200 switch family with firmware version prior to V5\\.0\\.0\\. Alternatively, the affected products may be identified by using their Machine\\-Readable Product Designation (MLFB). Products with the following MLFBs are affected:* 6GK5224\\-0BA00\\-2AA3* 6GK5216\\-0BA00\\-2AA3* 6GK5212\\-2BB00\\-2AA3* 6GK5212\\-2BC00\\-2AA3* 6GK5208\\-0BA10\\-2AA3* 6GK5206\\-1BB10\\-2AA3* 6GK5206\\-1BC10\\-2AA3* 6GK5204\\-2BB10\\-2AA3* 6GK5204\\-2BC10\\-2AA3* 6GK5208\\-0HA10\\-2AA6* 6GK5204\\-0BA00\\-2AF2* 6GK5208\\-0BA00\\-2AF2* 6GK5206\\-1BC00\\-2AF2* 6GK5204\\-2BC00\\-2AF2* 6GK5204\\-2BB10\\-2CA2\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow attackers to hijack Web sessions over the network without authentication. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Siemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany. Siemens develops products mainly in the energy, transportation, and healthcare sectors. The affected products, SCALANCE X\\-200 switches, are used to connect industrial components such as PLCs or HMIs. These switches use a Web\\-based interface that enables administrators to change device configuration using an Internet browser.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### INSUFFICIENT ENTROPYCWE\\-331: Insufficient Entropy, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/331\\.html, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013\\. The authentication of the integrated Web server of SCALANCE X\\-200 switches might allow attackers to hijack Web sessions over the network without authentication because of insufficient entropy in its random number generator. CVE\\-2013\\-5709NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2013\\-5709 , NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8\\.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version\\=2\\&vector\\=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013\\.### VULNERABILITY DETAILS#### EXPLOITABILITY This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.#### DIFFICULTY An attacker with a medium skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.MITIGATION---------- Siemens has produced a new version of SCALANCE X\\-200 firmware, V5\\.0\\.0\\. This new version fixes the Web hijack vulnerability. Users may obtain a copy of V5\\.0\\.0 at the following location on the Siemens Web site:<http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/de/78458674> Siemens security advisory is located here:[http://www.siemens.com/corporate\\-technology/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens\\_security\\_advisory\\_ssa\\-850708\\.pdf](http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/pool/de/forschungsfelder/siemens_security_advisory_ssa-850708.pdf)  ICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems. Critical devices and/or systems\u00a0should not directly face the Internet.* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  .\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  ,\u00a0that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT Web page ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ). Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. In addition, ICS\u2011CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not click Web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages. 2\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us\\-cert.gov/reading\\_room/emailscams\\_0905\\.pdf, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013\\.\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams. 3\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04\\-014, http://www.us\\-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04\\-014\\.html, Web site last accessed September 11, 2013\\.\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.
