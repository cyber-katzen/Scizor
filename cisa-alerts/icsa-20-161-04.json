This could allow a local unauthorized user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2020-7580 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n--------- End Update K Part 2 of 2 ---------\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nAnder Martinez of Titanium Industrial Security and INCIBE reported this vulnerability to Siemens.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released updates for the following affected products and is working on further updates.
