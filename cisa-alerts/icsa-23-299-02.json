EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits are available\nVendor: Centralite\nEquipment: Pearl Thermostat\nVulnerability: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service on the affected product.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions Centralite Pearl Thermostat are affected:\n\nPearl Thermostat: version 0x04075010\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE-770\nA vulnerability in Centralite Pearl Thermostat 0x04075010 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via a crafted Zigbee message.\nCVE-2023-24678\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities, Communications\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nXiaoyue Ma (xma9@gmu.edu), Lannan \"Lisa\" Luo (lluo4@gmu.edu) and Qiang Zeng (zeng@gmu.edu) of George Mason University reported this vulnerability.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nCentralite has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate this vulnerability. Users of affected versions of Centralite Pearl Thermostat are invited to contact Centralite\u00a0customer support\u00a0for additional information.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n5.
