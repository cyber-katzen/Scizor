EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.4*** **ATTENTION**  : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Emerson* **Equipment**  : ROC800\\-Series RTU; including ROC800, ROC800L, and DL8000 Preset Controllers* **Vulnerability**  : Authentication Bypass2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition or gain unauthorized access to data or control of the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following products are affected:* ROC809 \\& ROC827\u2014 All firmware versions, all hardware series* ROC809L \\& ROC827L\u2014 All firmware versions* DL8000\u2014 All firmware versions, all hardware series The Series 1 ROC800 and DL8000 became obsolete in 2008 when the Series 2 was introduced.### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [Authentication Bypass By Primary Weakness CWE\\-305](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html)** ROC800\\-Series RTU devices are vulnerable to an authentication bypass, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to data or control of the device and cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition.[CVE\\-2023\\-1935](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-1935)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:**  Multiple Sectors* **Countries/Areas Deployed:**  Worldwide* **Company Headquarters Location:**  USA### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Emerson reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Emerson ROC800\\-Series RTU firmware updates can be applied to patch the authentication vulnerability:* ROC800 Series 2\u20143\\.91 firmware or later at [SupportNet Portal](https://www3.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/v3/main.html)  (login required)* ROC800 Series 1\u2014Update hardware to Series 2 with 3\\.91 firmware or later* ROC800L Series 2\u20141\\.71 firmware or later at [SupportNet Portal](https://www3.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/v3/main.html)  (login required)* DL8000 Series 2\u20142\\.60 firmware or later at [SupportNet Portal](https://www3.emersonprocess.com/remote/support/v3/main.html)  (login required)* DL8000 Series 1\u2014Update hardware to Series 2 with 2\\.60 firmware or later Before installing firmware into the RTU, validate the MD5/SHA256 Hashes published by Emerson on SupportNet match the firmware image confirming it is genuine and unmodified. Emerson recommends users follow guidance in the ROC800\\-Series Remote Operations Controller Instruction Manual under section 1\\.11 Secure Gateway D301766X012\\. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
