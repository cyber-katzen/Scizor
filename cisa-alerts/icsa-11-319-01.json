This information was reported to Zero Day Initiative by independent security researcher Luigi Auriemma.\nThese vulnerabilities exploit unauthenticated remote code execution within the CEServer Operation and the CEServer.exe directories.\nZero Day Initiative has coordinated with InduSoft, who has produced a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities.\nAffected Products\nAccording to InduSoft, these vulnerabilities affect the following products:\n\nInduSoft Web Studio Versions 6.1 and 7.0.\n\nImpact\nAn attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities can execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBackground\nAccording to InduSoft, Web Studio is a collection of automation tools used to develop human-machine interfaces, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and embedded instrumentation solutions. Web Studio is a software product sold worldwide in industries dealing with system automation.\nVulnerability Characterization\nVulnerability Overview\nUnauthenticated Remote Code Execution\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of InduSoft Web Studio. The vulnerability exists within the remote agent component (CEServer.exe) that listens by default on Port 4322/TCP. When handling incoming requests, the process fails to perform any type of authentication.\nCVE-2011-4051 has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nRemote Code Execution\nThis vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of InduSoft Web Studio. This vulnerability exists within the CEServer component, which is used as a runtime dependency for deployed applications that use InduSoft Web Studio. When handling the remove file operation (0x15), the process blindly copies user-supplied data to a fixed-length buffer on the stack.\nCVE-2011-4052 has been assigned to this vulnerability.\nVulnerability Details\nExploitability\nThese vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.\nExistence of Exploit\nNo known public exploits exist that target these vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nAn attacker with a moderate skill level could exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMitigation\nInduSoft recommends that customers of InduSoft Web Studio software upgrade to the latest version and install the latest patch.\nIn addition to installing the latest version and patch of InduSoft Web Studio, ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nThe Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n\n",
