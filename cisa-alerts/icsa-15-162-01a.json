RLE has been unresponsive in validating or addressing the alleged vulnerability. ICS-CERT is releasing this advisory to warn and protect critical asset owners of this serious issue.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following RLE International GmbH product is affected:\n\nNova-Wind Turbine HMI\n\nIMPACT\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------\nPlain text credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the device. This means that a malicious party could perform any action on the device including change or modify configurations and settings.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ----------\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation\nBACKGROUND\nRLE International GmbH is a Germany-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, Sweden, and India.\nThe affected product, Nova-Wind Turbine HMI, is a human-machine interface (HMI) for a wind turbine. This product is used in the Energy Sector.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------\n\nPLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORDCWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html, web site last accessed June 11, 2015.\n\nThe Nova-Wind Turbine HMI stores credentials in a plaintext file. If a malicious user recovers this file, then they could use the credentials to authenticate with the HMI and make changes to the configuration.\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ----------\nCVE-2015-3951NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3951, web site last accessed June 15, 2015. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed June 11, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nICS-CERT has attempted on multiple occasions to contact the vendor regarding this serious flaw and have according to our vulnerability disclosure policy now produced this advisory. Insecure credential vulnerabilities create a serious risk to asset owners. ICS-CERT strongly recommends ensuring that the impacted product is not connected to the Internet or any network as this vulnerability is remotely exploitable.\nICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
