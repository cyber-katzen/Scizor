For the most up\\-to\\-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services \\| Services \\| Siemens Global).](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications) 1\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.9*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  SINEC INS* **Vulnerabilities:**  OS Command Injection, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Out\\-of\\-bounds Write, HTTP Request Smuggling, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, Path Traversal, Command Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read and write arbitrary files from the file system of the affected component and to ultimately execute arbitrary code on the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS Siemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following network services application:* SINEC INS: versions prior to V1\\.0 SP2 Update 1### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)** In addition to the c\\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE\\-2022\\-1292, code review found further circumstances where the c\\_rehash script does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. When CVE\\-2022\\-1292 was fixed, code review did not discover other places in the script where the file names of hashed certificates were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.[CVE\\-2022\\-2068](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2068)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE\\-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)** An OS command injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions \\<14\\.20\\.0, \\<16\\.16\\.0, \\<18\\.5\\.0 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that could easily be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS requests allowing rebinding attacks.[CVE\\-2022\\-32212](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32212)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)** AES OCB mode for 32\\-bit x86 platforms using the AES\\-NI assembly optimized implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of unwritten data preexisting in the memory. \u201cIn place\" encryption could reveal sixteen bytes of the plaintext. Because OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.[CVE\\-2022\\-2097](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2097)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [CVSS:3\\.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** The OpenSSL 3\\.0\\.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue leads to incorrect RSA implementation with 2048\\-bit private keys on such machines, and memory corruption will happen during the computation. Due to memory corruption, an attacker could trigger remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. This issue affects SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048\\-bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\\_64 architecture.[CVE\\-2022\\-2274](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2274)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
