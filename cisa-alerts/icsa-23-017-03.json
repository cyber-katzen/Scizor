For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.9\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity \u00a0\nVendor: Siemens\u00a0\nEquipment: SINEC INS\u00a0\nVulnerabilities: OS Command Injection, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Out-of-bounds Write, HTTP Request Smuggling, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, Path Traversal, Command Injection\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read and write arbitrary files from the file system of the affected component and to ultimately execute arbitrary code on the device.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports these vulnerabilities affect the following network services application:\u00a0\n\nSINEC INS: versions prior to V1.0 SP2 Update 1\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1 OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nIn addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, code review found further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. When CVE-2022-1292 was fixed, code review did not discover other places in the script where the file names of hashed certificates were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2068 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78\u00a0\nAn OS command injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.20.0, <16.16.0, <18.5.0 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that could easily be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS requests allowing rebinding attacks.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32212 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.3\u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\u00a0\nAES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimized implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of unwritten data preexisting in the memory. \u201cIn place\" encryption could reveal sixteen bytes of the plaintext. Because OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2097 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.4\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\u00a0\nThe OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue leads to incorrect RSA implementation with 2048-bit private keys on such machines, and memory corruption will happen during the computation. Due to memory corruption, an attacker could trigger remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. This issue affects SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048-bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-2274 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.5\u00a0HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING CWE-444\nThe llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1, and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js do not correctly parse and validate transfer-encoding headers and could lead to HTTP request smuggling (HRS).\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32213 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.6\u00a0HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING CWE-444\u00a0\nThe llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1, and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js do not correctly handle multi-line transfer-encoding headers. This could lead to HTTP request smuggling (HRS).\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32215 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.7\u00a0INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326\u00a0\nA cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on Linux in versions 18.x prior to 18.40.0, which allows a default path for openssl.cnf that could be accessible by a non-admin user under some circumstances, instead of /etc/ssl, as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-32222 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.8\u00a0USE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE-330\u00a0\nNode.js makes calls to EntropySource() in SecretKeyGenTraits::DoKeyGen() in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc. However, it does not check the return value; it assumes EntropySource() always succeeds, but it can (and sometimes will) fail.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-35255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.9\u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY SPOOFING CWE-290\u00a0\nThe llhttp parser in the http module in Node.js v18.7.0 does not correctly handle header fields that are not terminated with CLRF. This could result in HRS.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-35256 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.10\u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\u00a0\nAn authenticated remote attacker with access to the affected product\u2019s web-based management (443/TCP) could potentially read and write arbitrary files to and from the device's file system. An attacker could leverage this to trigger remote code execution on the affected component.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-45092 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.11\u00a0PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-22\u00a0\nAn authenticated remote attacker with access to the web-based management (443/TCP) of the affected product, as well as with access to the secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) server of the affected product (22/TCP), could potentially read and write arbitrary files to and from the device's file system. An attacker could leverage this to trigger remote code execution on the affected component.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-45093 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.2.12\u00a0COMMAND INJECTION CWE-77\u00a0\nAn authenticated remote attacker with access to the affected product\u2019s web-based management (443/TCP) could potentially inject commands into the affected product\u2019s DHCPD configuration. An attacker could leverage this to trigger remote code execution on the affected component.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-45094 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\u00a0\n4.
