Summary      Description     This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the North Korean government. This malware variant has been identified as CROWDEDFLOUNDER. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https\\[:]//www\\[.]us\\-cert.gov/hiddencobra.       DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.       This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.       This report analyzes a Themida packed 32\\-bit Windows executable, which is designed to unpack and execute a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) binary in memory. This application is designed to accept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments. It is designed to listen as a proxy for incoming connections containing commands or can connect to a remote server to receive commands.

This application is designed to accept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments. When executed, the application is designed to open the Windows Firewall on the victim\u2019s machine to allow for incoming and outgoing connections from the victim system. The firewall is modified using a \"netsh firewall add portopening\" command (Figure 2\\). Static analysis indicates this malware may be utilized to listen as a proxy for incoming connections containing commands or can connect to a remote server to receive commands. The following command line arguments are utilized to control the RAT functionality:       \\-\\-Begin RAT command line arguments\\-\\-       \\-p: You can use the \\-p command line argument to force the malware to listen on a specific port. Example: malware.exe \\-p 8888       \\-h: You can use the \\-h CLI to force the malware to connect to a remote host and port. Example: malware.exe \\-h \\<url\\_string\\>:8888       Note: \\<url\\_string\\> can be either a fully qualified domain name or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.       \\-\\-End RAT command line arguments\\-\\-       The RAT uses a rotating exclusive or (XOR) cryptographic algorithm to secure its data transfers and command\\-and\\-control (C2\\) sessions (Figure 1\\). The malware is designed to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions:       \\-\\-Begin functions performed by the malware\\-\\-     Download and upload files     Execute secondary payloads     Execute shell commands     Terminate running processes     Delete files     Search files     Set file attributes     Collect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type)     List running processes information     Collect and send information about the victim's system     Securely download malicious DLLs and inject them into remote processes     \\-\\-End functions performed by the malware\\-\\-       The \\-h argument is utilized to force the RAT to connect to a C2 server and the CURL library (Version 7\\.49\\.1\\) will be used for data transfers. Note: A rotating XOR cipher will be used to secure all C2 traffic sent and received from the external C2 server. Although the malware appears to expect a numeric IP address with the \\-h argument, it will also accept a string Uniform Resource Locator (URL) value. If a URL string is provided (i.e. domain.com) the malware will then query this address using the Win32 API getaddrinfo(). If this call succeeds, an IP address will be returned and the malware will attempt to connect to that IP address. If the call to getaddrinfo() fails the malware will hash this domain using the MD5 hashing algorithm, resulting in a 16 byte hash value. The malware will then take bytes 4 through 8 of this hash value and XOR them with a four byte value. The resultant four byte value will then be treated as a numeric IP address. The malware will then attempt to connect to this newly generated IP address. Note: all of the command line executables referenced within this product generate and connect to an IP address generated from the provided URL string if the call to getaddrinfo() against the provided URL fails.     Screenshots         Figure 1 \\- XOR based cipher utilized by RAT to secure traffic between itself and the operator/C2 server.

Recommendations      CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up\\-to\\-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up\\-to\\-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e\\-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e\\-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
