EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: FATEK Automation\nEquipment: WinProladder\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds Write, Out-of-bounds Read, Unexpected Sign Extension, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use After Free\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow arbitrary code execution, remote code execution, heap corruption, and unauthorized information disclosure.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of FATEK Automation WinProladder, a PLC programming software are affected:\n\nWinProladder: Versions 3.30 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nA use after free vulnerability may be exploited when a valid user opens a malformed project file, which may allow arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2021-38438 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, which could result in an out-of-bounds write. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-38426 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNEXPECTED SIGN EXTENSION CWE-194\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, which could result in an unexpected sign extension. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-38434 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, which could result in a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-38430 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, which could result in a memory-corruption condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38436 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nThe affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, which could result in a heap-corruption condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2021-38442 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may allow an attacker to read unauthorized information.\nCVE-2021-38440 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Taiwan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nxina1i and Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson), working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFATEK Automation has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Users of these affected products are invited to contact FATEK customer support for additional information.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
