In 2022, CISA conducted a red team assessment (RTA) at the request of a large critical infrastructure organization with multiple geographically separated sites. The team gained persistent access to the organization\u2019s network, moved laterally across the organization\u2019s multiple geographically separated sites, and eventually gained access to systems adjacent to the organization\u2019s sensitive business systems (SBSs). Multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts prevented the team from achieving access to one SBS, and the team was unable to complete its viable plan to compromise a second SBSs within the assessment period. Despite having a mature cyber posture, the organization did not detect the red team\u2019s activity throughout the assessment, including when the team attempted to trigger a security response. CISA is releasing this CSA detailing the red team\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and key findings to provide network defenders of critical infrastructure organizations proactive steps to reduce the threat of similar activity from malicious cyber actors. This CSA highlights the importance of collecting and monitoring logs for unusual activity as well as continuous testing and exercises to ensure your organization\u2019s environment is not vulnerable to compromise, regardless of the maturity of its cyber posture. CISA encourages critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA\u2014including conduct regular testing within their security operations center\u2014to ensure security processes and procedures are up to date, effective, and enable timely detection and mitigation of malicious activity.

See the appendix for a table of the red team\u2019s activity mapped to MITRE ATT\\&CK tactics and techniques.##### **Introduction** CISA has authority to, upon request, provide analyses, expertise, and other technical assistance to critical infrastructure owners and operators and provide operational and timely technical assistance to Federal and non\\-Federal entities with respect to cybersecurity risks. (See generally 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 652\\[c]\\[5], 659\\[c]\\[6].) After receiving a request for a red team assessment (RTA) from an organization and coordinating some high\\-level details of the engagement with certain personnel at the organization, CISA conducted the RTA over a three\\-month period in 2022\\. During RTAs, a CISA red team emulates cyber threat actors to assess an organization\u2019s cyber detection and response capabilities. During Phase I, the red team attempts to gain and maintain persistent access to an organization\u2019s enterprise network while avoiding detection and evading defenses. During Phase II, the red team attempts to trigger a security response from the organization\u2019s people, processes, or technology. The \u201cvictim\u201d for this assessment was a large organization with multiple geographically separated sites throughout the United States. For this assessment, the red team\u2019s goal during Phase I was to gain access to certain sensitive business systems (SBSs).##### **Phase I: Red Team Cyber Threat Activity**##### *Overview* The organization\u2019s network was segmented with both logical and geographical boundaries. CISA\u2019s red team gained initial access to two organization workstations at separate sites via spearphishing emails. After gaining access and leveraging Active Directory (AD) data, the team gained persistent access to a third host via spearphishing emails. From that host, the team moved laterally to a misconfigured server, from which they compromised the domain controller (DC). They then used forged credentials to move to multiple hosts across different sites in the environment and eventually gained root access to all workstations connected to the organization\u2019s mobile device management (MDM) server. The team used this root access to move laterally to SBS\\-connected workstations. However, a multifactor authentication (MFA) prompt prevented the team from achieving access to one SBS, and Phase I ended before the team could implement a seemingly viable plan to achieve access to a second SBS.##### *Initial Access and Active Directory Discovery* The CISA red team gained initial access \\[ [TA0001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/tactics/TA0001/ \"Initial Access\")  ] to two workstations at geographically separated sites (Site 1 and Site 2\\) via spearphishing emails. The team first conducted open\\-source research\u00a0\\[ [TA0043](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/tactics/TA0043/ \"Reconnaissance\")  ] to identify potential targets for spearphishing. Specifically, the team looked for email addresses \\[ [T1589\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1589/002/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses\")  ] as well as names \\[ [T1589\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1589/003/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Employee Names\")  ] that could be used to derive email addresses based on the team\u2019s identification of the email naming scheme. The red team sent tailored spearphishing emails to seven targets using commercially available email platforms \\[ [T1585\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1585/002/ \"Establish Accounts: Email Accounts\")  ]. The team used the logging and tracking features of one of the platforms to analyze the organization\u2019s email filtering defenses and confirm the emails had reached the target\u2019s inbox. The team built a rapport with some targeted individuals through emails, eventually leading these individuals to accept a virtual meeting invite. The meeting invite took them to a red team\\-controlled domain\u00a0\\[ [T1566\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/002/ \"Phishing: Spearphishing Link\")  ] with a button, which, when clicked, downloaded a \u201cmalicious\u201d ISO file \\[ [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1204/ \"User Execution\")  ]. After the download, another button appeared, which, when clicked, executed the file. Two of the seven targets responded to the phishing attempt, giving the red team access to a workstation at Site 1 (Workstation 1\\) and a workstation at Site 2\\. On Workstation 1, the team leveraged a modified SharpHound collector, `ldapsearch`  , and command\\-line tool, `dsquery`  , to query and scrape AD information, including AD users \\[ [T1087\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1087/002/ \"Account Discovery: Domain Account\")  ], computers \\[ [T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1018 \"Remote System Discovery\")  ], groups \\[ [T1069\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1069/002/ \"Permission Groups Discovery: Domain Groups\")  ], access control lists (ACLs), organizational units (OU), and group policy objects (GPOs) \\[ [T1615](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1615/ \"Group Policy Discovery\")  ]. **Note:**  SharpHound is a [BloodHound](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0521/ \"BloodHound\")  collector, an open\\-source AD reconnaissance tool. Bloodhound has multiple collectors that assist with information querying. There were 52 hosts in the AD that had `Unconstrained Delegation`  enabled and a `lastlogon`  timestamp within 30 days of the query. Hosts with `Unconstrained Delegation`  enabled store Kerberos ticket\\-granting tickets (TGTs) of all users that have authenticated to that host. Many of these hosts, including a Site 1 SharePoint server, were Windows Server 2012R2\\. The default configuration of Windows Server 2012R2 allows unprivileged users to query group membership of local administrator groups. The red team queried parsed Bloodhound data for members of the SharePoint admin group and identified several standard user accounts with administrative access. The team initiated a second spearphishing campaign, similar to the first, to target these users. One user triggered the red team\u2019s payload, which led to installation of a persistent beacon on the user\u2019s workstation (Workstation 2\\), giving the team persistent access to Workstation 2\\.##### *Lateral Movement, Credential Access, and Persistence* The red team moved laterally \\[ [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/tactics/TA0008/ \"Lateral Movement\")  ] from Workstation 2 to the Site 1 SharePoint server and had `SYSTEM`  level access to the Site 1 SharePoint server, which had `Unconstrained Delegation`  enabled. They used this access to obtain the cached credentials of all logged\\-in users\u2014including the New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM) hash for the SharePoint server account. To obtain the credentials, the team took a snapshot of `lsass.exe`  \\[ [T1003\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1003/001 \"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\")  ] with a tool called `nanodump`  , exported the output, and processed the output offline with `Mimikatz`  . The team then exploited the `Unconstrained Delegation`  misconfiguration to steal the DC\u2019s TGT. They ran the [DFSCoerce](https://github.com/Wh04m1001/DFSCoerce \"Wh04m1001 / DFSCoerce\")  python script ( `DFSCoerce.py`  ), which prompted DC authentication to the SharePoint server using the server\u2019s NTLM hash. The team then deployed [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus)  to capture the incoming DC TGT \\[ [T1550\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash\")  ], \\[ [T1557\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1557/001/ \"Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\")  ]. (DFSCoerce abuses Microsoft's Distributed File System \\[MS\\-DFSNM] protocol to relay authentication against an arbitrary server.\\[ [1](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-dfscoerce-ntlm-relay-attack-allows-windows-domain-takeover/ \"New DFSCoerce NTLM Relay attack allows Windows domain takeover\")  ]) The team then used the TGT to harvest advanced encryption standard (AES)\\-256 hashes via `DCSync`  \\[ [T1003\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1003/006/ \"OS Credential Dumping: DCSync\")  ] for the `krbtgt`  account and several privileged accounts\u2014including domain admins, workstation admins, and a system center configuration management (SCCM) service account (SCCM Account 1\\). The team used the `krbtgt`  account hash throughout the rest of their assessment to perform golden ticket attacks \\[ [T1558\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1558/001/ \"Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Golden Ticket\")  ] in which they forged legitimate TGTs. The team also used the `asktgt`  command to impersonate accounts they had credentials for by requesting account TGTs \\[ [T1550\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1550/003/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket\")  ]. The team first impersonated the SCCM Account 1 and moved laterally to a Site 1 SCCM distribution point (DP) server (SCCM Server 1\\) that had direct network access to Workstation 2\\. The team then moved from SCCM Server 1 to a central SCCM server (SCCM Server 2\\) at a third site (Site 3\\). Specifically, the team:1. Queried the AD using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for information about the network's sites and subnets \\[ [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\")  ]. This query revealed all organization sites and subnets broken down by classless inter\\-domain routing (CIDR) subnet and description.2. Used LDAP queries and domain name system (DNS) requests to identify recently active hosts.3. Listed existing network connections \\[ [T1049](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1049/ \"System Network Connections Discovery\")  ] on SCCM Server 1, which revealed an active Server Message Block (SMB) connection from SCCM Server 2\\.4. Attempted to move laterally to the SCCM Server 2 via `AppDomain`  hijacking, but the HTTPS beacon failed to call back.5. Attempted to move laterally with an SMB beacon \\[ [T1021\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1021/002/ \"Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\")  ], which was successful. The team also moved from SCCM Server 1 to a Site 1 workstation (Workstation 3\\) that housed an active server administrator. The team impersonated an administrative service account via a golden ticket attack (from SCCM Server 1\\); the account had administrative privileges on Workstation 3\\. The user employed a KeePass password manager that the team was able to use to obtain passwords for other internal websites, a kernel\\-based virtual machine (KVM) server, virtual private network (VPN) endpoints, firewalls, and another KeePass database with credentials. The server administrator relied on a password manager, which stored credentials in a database file. The red team pulled the decryption key from memory using [KeeThief](https://github.com/GhostPack/KeeThief \"KeeThief\")  and used it to unlock the database \\[ [T1555\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1555/005/ \"Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers\")  ]. At the organization\u2019s request, the red team confirmed that SCCM Server 2 provided access to the organization\u2019s sites because firewall rules allowed SMB traffic to SCCM servers at all other sites. The team moved laterally from SCCM Server 2 to an SCCM DP server at Site 5 and from the SCCM Server 1 to hosts at two other sites (Sites 4 and 6\\). The team installed persistent beacons at each of these sites. Site 5 was broken into a private and a public subnet and only DCs were able to cross that boundary. To move between the subnets, the team moved through DCs. Specifically, the team moved from the Site 5 SCCM DP server to a public DC; and then they moved from the public DC to the private DC. The team was then able to move from the private DC to workstations in the private subnet. The team leveraged access available from SCCM 2 to move around the organization\u2019s network for post\\-exploitation activities (See Post\\-Exploitation Activity section). See Figure 1 for a timeline of the red team\u2019s initial access and lateral movement showing key access points.![Figure 1: Red Team Cyber Threat Activity: Initial Access and Lateral Movement](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2023-03/figure_1.jpg?itok=hNji0eU-)*Figure 1: Red Team Cyber Threat Activity: Initial Access and Lateral Movement*  While traversing the network, the team varied their lateral movement techniques to evade detection and because the organization had non\\-uniform firewalls between the sites and within the sites (within the sites, firewalls were configured by subnet). The team\u2019s primary methods to move between sites were `AppDomainManager`  hijacking and dynamic\\-link library (DLL) hijacking \\[ [T1574\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1574/001/)  ]. In some instances, they used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event Subscriptions \\[ [T1546\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1546/003/)  ]. The team impersonated several accounts to evade detection while moving. When possible, the team remotely enumerated the local administrators group on target hosts to find a valid user account. This technique relies on anonymous SMB pipe binds \\[ [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1071/)  ], which are disabled by default starting with Windows Server 2016\\. In other cases, the team attempted to determine valid accounts based on group name and purpose. If the team had previously acquired the credentials, they used `asktgt`  to impersonate the account. If the team did not have the credentials, they used the golden ticket attack to forge the account.##### *Post\\-Exploitation Activity: Gaining Access to SBSs* With persistent, deep access established across the organization\u2019s networks and subnetworks, the red team began post\\-exploitation activities and attempted to access SBSs. Trusted agents of the organization tasked the team with gaining access to two specialized servers (SBS 1 and SBS 2\\). The team achieved root access to three SBS\\-adjacent workstations but was unable to move laterally to the SBS servers:* Phase I ended before the team could implement a plan to move to SBS 1\\.* An MFA prompt blocked the team from moving to SBS 2, and Phase I ended before they could implement potential workarounds. However, the team assesses that by using Secure Shell (SSH) session socket files (see below), they could have accessed any hosts available to the users whose workstations were compromised.##### *Plan for Potential Access to SBS 1* Conducting open\\-source research \\[ [1591\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1591/001/ \"Gather Victim Org Information: Determine Physical Locations\")  ], the team identified that SBS 1 and 2 assets and associated management/upkeep staff were located at Sites 5 and 6, respectively. Adding previously collected AD data to this discovery, the team was able to identify a specific SBS 1 admin account. The team planned to use the organization\u2019s mobile device management (MDM) software to move laterally to the SBS 1 administrator\u2019s workstation and, from there, pivot to SBS 1 assets. The team identified the organization\u2019s MDM vendor using open\\-source and AD information \\[ [T1590\\.006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1590/006/ \"Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances\")  ] and moved laterally to an MDM distribution point server at Site 5 (MDM DP 1\\). This server contained backups of the MDM MySQL database on its `D:`  drive in the `Backup`  directory. The backups included the encryption key needed to decrypt any encrypted values, such as SSH passwords \\[ [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1552/ \"Unsecured Credentials\")  ]. The database backup identified both the user of the SBS 1 administrator account (USER 2\\) and the user\u2019s workstation (Workstation 4\\), which the MDM software remotely administered. The team moved laterally to an MDM server (MDM 1\\) at Site 3, searched files on the server, and found plaintext credentials \\[ [T1552\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1552/001/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\")  ] to an application programming interface (API) user account stored in PowerShell scripts. The team attempted to leverage these credentials to browse to the web login page of the MDM vendor but were unable to do so because the website directed to an organization\\-controlled single\\-sign on (SSO) authentication page. The team gained root access to workstations connected to MDM 1\u2014specifically, the team accessed Workstation 4\u2014by:1. Selecting an MDM user from the plaintext credentials in PowerShell scripts on MDM 1\\.2. While in the MDM MySQL database,\t* Elevating the selected MDM user\u2019s account privileges to administrator privileges, and\t* Modifying the user\u2019s account by adding\t `Create Policy` \t and\t `Delete Policy` \t permissions \\[\t [T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1098 \"Account Manipulation\") \t ], \\[\t [T1548](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1548/ \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\") \t ].3. Creating a policy via the MDM API \\[T1106], which instructed Workstation 4 to download and execute a payload to give the team interactive access as root to the workstation.4. Verifying their interactive access.5. Resetting permissions back to their original state by removing the policy via the MDM API and removing `Create Policy`  and `Delete Policy`  and administrator permissions and from the MDM user\u2019s account. While interacting with Workstation 4, the team found an open SSH socket file and a corresponding `netstat`  connection to a host that the team identified as a bastion host from architecture documentation found on Workstation 4\\. The team planned to move from Workstation 4 to the bastion host to SBS 1\\. **Note:**  A SSH socket file allows a user to open multiple SSH sessions through a single, already authenticated SSH connection without additional authentication. The team could not take advantage of the open SSH socket. Instead, they searched through SBS 1 architecture diagrams and documentation on Workstation 4\\. They found a security operations (SecOps) network diagram detailing the network boundaries between Site 5 SecOps on\\-premises systems, Site 5 non\\-SecOps on\\-premises systems, and Site 5 SecOps cloud infrastructure. The documentation listed the SecOps cloud infrastructure IP ranges \\[ [T1580](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1580/ \"Cloud Infrastructure Discovery\")  ]. These \u201ctrusted\u201d IP addresses were a public `/16`  subnet; the team was able to request a public IP in that range from the same cloud provider, and Workstation 4 made successful outbound SSH connections to this cloud infrastructure. The team intended to use that connection to reverse tunnel traffic back to the workstation and then access the bastion host via the open SSH socket file. However, Phase 1 ended before they were able to implement this plan.##### *Attempts to Access SBS 2* Conducting open\\-source research, the team identified an organizational branch \\[ [T1591](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1591/ \"Gather Victim Org Information\")  ] that likely had access to SBS 2\\. The team queried the AD to identify the branch\u2019s users and administrators. The team gathered a list of potential accounts, from which they identified administrators, such as `SYSTEMS ADMIN`  or `DATA SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR`  , with technical roles. Using their access to the MDM MySQL database, the team queried potential targets to (1\\) determine the target\u2019s last contact time with the MDM and (2\\) ensure any policy targeting the target\u2019s workstation would run relatively quickly \\[ [T1596\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1596/005/ \"Search Open Technical Databases: Scan Databases\")  ]. Using the same methodology as described by the steps in the Plan for Potential Access to SBS 1 section above, the team gained interactive root access to two Site 6 SBS 2\\-connected workstations: a software engineering workstation (Workstation 5\\) and a user administrator workstation (Workstation 6\\). The Workstation 5 user had bash history files with what appeared to be SSH passwords mistyped into the bash prompt and saved in bash history \\[ [T1552\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1552/003/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Bash History\")  ]. The team then attempted to authenticate to SBS 2 using a similar tunnel setup as described in the Access to SBS 1 section above and the potential credentials from the user\u2019s bash history file. However, this attempt was unsuccessful for unknown reasons. On Workstation 6, the team found a `.txt`  file containing plaintext credentials for the user. Using the pattern discovered in these credentials, the team was able to crack the user\u2019s workstation account password \\[ [T1110\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1110/002/ \"Brute Force: Password Cracking\")  ]. The team also discovered potential passwords and SSH connection commands in the user\u2019s bash history. Using a similar tunnel setup described above, the team attempted to log into SBS 2\\. However, a prompt for an MFA passcode blocked this attempt. See figure 2 for a timeline of the team\u2019s post exploitation activity that includes key points of access.![Figure 2: Red Team Cyber Threat Activity: Post Exploitation](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2023-03/figure_2.jpg?itok=weNTd6WE)*Figure 2: Red Team Cyber Threat Activity: Post Exploitation* ##### *Command and Control* The team used third\\-party owned and operated infrastructure and services \\[ [T1583](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1583/)  ] throughout their assessment, including in certain cases for command and control (C2\\) \\[ [TA0011](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/tactics/TA0011/)  ]. These included:* [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0154/ \"Cobalt Strike\")  and Merlin payloads for C2 throughout the assessment. **Note:**  Merlin is a post\\-exploit tool that leverages HTTP protocols for C2 traffic.\t+ The team maintained multiple Cobalt Strike servers hosted by a cloud vendor. They configured each server with a different domain and used the servers for communication with compromised hosts. These servers retained all assessment data.* Two commercially available cloud\\-computing platforms.\t+ The team used these platforms to create flexible and dynamic redirect servers to send traffic to the team\u2019s Cobalt Strike servers \\[\t [T1090\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1090/002/) \t ]. Redirecting servers make it difficult for defenders to attribute assessment activities to the backend team servers. The redirectors used HTTPS reverse proxies to redirect C2 traffic between the target organization\u2019s network and the Cobalt Strike team servers \\[\t [T1071\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1071/002/) \t ]. The team encrypted all data in transit \\[\t [T1573](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1573/) \t ] using encryption keys stored on team\u2019s Cobalt Strike servers.* A cloud service to rapidly change the IP address of the team\u2019s redirecting servers in the event of detection and eradication.* Content delivery network (CDN) services to further obfuscate some of the team\u2019s C2 traffic.\t+ This technique leverages CDNs associated with high\\-reputation domains so that the malicious traffic appears to be directed towards a reputation domain but is actually redirected to the red team\\-controlled Cobalt Strike servers.\t+ The team used domain fronting \\[\t [T1090\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1090/004/) \t ] to disguise outbound traffic in order to diversify the domains with which the persistent beacons were communicating. This technique, which also leverages CDNs, allows the beacon to appear to connect to third\\-party domains, such as nytimes.com, when it is actually connecting to the team\u2019s redirect server.##### Phase II: Red Team Measurable Events Activity The red team executed 13 measurable events designed to provoke a response from the people, processes, and technology defending the organization\u2019s network.

These findings contributed to the team\u2019s ability to gain persistent, undetected access across the organization\u2019s sites. See the Mitigations section for recommendations on how to mitigate these issues.* **Insufficient host and network monitoring.**  Most of the red team\u2019s Phase II actions failed to provoke a response from the people, processes, and technology defending the organization\u2019s network. The organization failed to detect lateral movement, persistence, and C2 activity via their intrusion detection or prevention systems, endpoint protection platform, web proxy logs, and Windows event logs. Additionally, throughout Phase I, the team received no deconflictions or confirmation that the organization caught their activity. Below is a list of some of the higher risk activities conducted by the team that were opportunities for detection:\t+ Phishing\t+ Lateral movement reuse\t+ Generation and use of the golden ticket\t+ Anomalous LDAP traffic\t+ Anomalous internal share enumeration\t+ `Unconstrained Delegation` \t server compromise\t+ `DCSync`\t+ Anomalous account usage during lateral movement\t+ Anomalous outbound network traffic\t+ Anomalous outbound SSH connections to the team\u2019s cloud servers from workstations* **Lack of monitoring on endpoint management systems.**  The team used the organization\u2019s MDM system to gain root access to machines across the organization\u2019s network without being detected. Endpoint management systems provide elevated access to thousands of hosts and should be treated as high value assets (HVAs) with additional restrictions and monitoring.* **KRBTGT never changed.**  The Site 1 `krbtgt`  account password had not been updated for over a decade. The `krbtgt`  account is a domain default account that acts as a service account for the key distribution center (KDC) service used to encrypt and sign all Kerberos tickets for the domain. Compromise of the `krbtgt`  account could provide adversaries with the ability to sign their own TGTs, facilitating domain access years after the date of compromise. The red team was able to use the `krbtgt`  account to forge TGTs for multiple accounts throughout Phase I.* **Excessive permissions to standard users.**  The team discovered several standard user accounts that have local administrator access to critical servers. This misconfiguration allowed the team to use the low\\-level access of a phished user to move laterally to an `Unconstrained Delegation`  host and compromise the entire domain.* **Hosts with** `Unconstrained Delegation`**enabled unnecessarily.**  Hosts with `Unconstrained Delegation`  enabled store the Kerberos TGTs of all users that authenticate to that host, enabling actors to steal service tickets or compromise `krbtgt`  accounts and perform golden ticket or [\u201csilver ticket\u201d attacks](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1558/002/ \"Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Silver Ticket\")  . The team performed an NTLM\\-relay attack to obtain the DC\u2019s TGT, followed by a golden ticket attack on a SharePoint server with Unconstrained Delegation to gain the ability to impersonate any Site 1 AD account.* **Use of non\\-secure default configurations.**  The organization used default configurations for hosts with Windows Server 2012 R2\\. The default configuration allows unprivileged users to query group membership of local administrator groups. The red team used and identified several standard user accounts with administrative access from a Windows Server 2012 R2 SharePoint server.##### *Additional Issues* The team noted the following additional issues.* **Ineffective separation of privileged accounts.**  Some workstations allowed unprivileged accounts to have local administrator access; for example, the red team discovered an ordinary user account in the local admin group for the SharePoint server. If a user with administrative access is compromised, an actor can access servers without needing to elevate privileges. Administrative and user accounts should be separated, and designated admin accounts should be exclusively used for admin purposes.* **Lack of server egress control.**  Most servers, including domain controllers, allowed unrestricted egress traffic to the internet.* **Inconsistent host configuration.**  The team observed inconsistencies on servers and workstations within the domain, including inconsistent membership in the local administrator group among different servers or workstations. For example, some workstations had \u201cServer Admins\u201d or \u201cDomain Admins\u201d as local administrators, and other workstations had neither.* **Potentially unwanted programs.**  The team noticed potentially unusual software, including music software, installed on both workstations and servers. These extraneous software installations indicate inconsistent host configuration (see above) and increase the attack surfaces for malicious actors to gain initial access or escalate privileges once in the network.* **Mandatory password changes enabled.**  During the assessment, the team keylogged a user during a mandatory password change and noticed that only the final character of their password was modified. This is potentially due to domain passwords being required to be changed every 60 days.* **Smart card use was inconsistent across the domain.**  While the technology was deployed, it was not applied uniformly, and there was a significant portion of users without smartcard protections enabled. The team used these unprotected accounts throughout their assessment to move laterally through the domain and gain persistence.##### *Noted Strengths* The red team noted the following technical controls or defensive measures that prevented or hampered offensive actions:* **The organization conducts regular, proactive penetration tests and adversarial assessments**  and invests in hardening their network based on findings.\t+ The team was unable to discover any easily exploitable services, ports, or web interfaces from more than three million external in\\-scope IPs. This forced the team to resort to phishing to gain initial access to the environment.\t+ Service account passwords were strong. The team was unable to crack any of the hashes obtained from the 610 service accounts pulled. This is a critical strength because it slowed the team from moving around the network in the initial parts of the Phase I.\t+ The team did not discover any useful credentials on open file shares or file servers. This slowed the progress of the team from moving around the network.* **MFA was used for some SBSs.**  The team was blocked from moving to SBS 2 by an MFA prompt.* **There were strong security controls and segmentation for SBS systems.**  Direct access to SBS were located in separate networks, and admins of SBS used workstations protected by local firewalls.#### **MITIGATIONS** CISA recommends organizations implement the recommendations in Table 2 to mitigate the issues listed in the Findings section of this advisory. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. See CISA\u2019s [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\")  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.*Table 2: Recommendations to Mitigate Identified Issues* | **Issue** | **Recommendation** || --- | --- || Insufficient host and network monitoring | * **Establish a security baseline of normal network traffic and tune network appliances**   to detect anomalous behavior \\[  [CPG 3\\.1](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ]. Tune host\\-based products to detect anomalous binaries, lateral movement, and persistence techniques. * Create alerts for Windows event log authentication codes, especially for the domain controllers. This could help detect some of the pass\\-the\\-ticket, DCSync, and other techniques described in this report. * From a detection standpoint, focus on identity and access management (IAM) rather than just network traffic or static host alerts. * Consider who is accessing what (what resource), from where (what internal host or external location), and when (what day and time the access occurs). * Look for access behavior that deviates from expected or is indicative of AD abuse. * **Reduce the attack surface by limiting the use of legitimate administrative pathways and tools**   such as PowerShell, PSExec, and WMI, which are often used by malicious actors. CISA recommends selecting one tool to administer the network, ensuring logging is turned on \\[  [CPG 3\\.1](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ], and disabling the others. * **Consider using \u201choneypot\u201d service principal names (SPNs)**   to detect attempts to crack account hashes \\[  [CPG 1\\.1](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ]. * **Conduct regular assessments**   to ensure processes and procedures are up to date and can be followed by security staff and end users. * Consider using red team tools, such as SharpHound, for AD enumeration to identify users with excessive privileges and misconfigured hosts (e.g., with  `Unconstrained Delegation`   enabled). * **Ensure all commercial tools deployed in your environment are regularly tuned**   to pick up on relevant activity in your environment. || Lack of monitoring on endpoint management systems | * **Treat endpoint management systems as HVAs**   with additional restrictions and monitoring because they provide elevated access to thousands of hosts. || KRBTGT never changed | * **Change the**  `krbtgt` **account password on a regular schedule**   such as every 6 to 12 months or if it becomes compromised. Note that this password change must be carefully performed to effectively change the credential without breaking AD functionality. The password must be changed twice to effectively invalidate the old credentials. However, the required waiting period between resets must be greater than the maximum lifetime period of Kerberos tickets, which is 10 hours by default. See Microsoft\u2019s  [KRBTGT account maintenance considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn745899(v=ws.11)#krbtgt-account-maintenance-considerations)   guidance for more information. || Excessive permissions to standard users and ineffective separation of privileged accounts | * Implement the principle of least privilege: * **Grant standard user rights for standard user tasks**   such as email, web browsing, and using line\\-of\\-business (LOB) applications. * **Periodically audit standard accounts**   and minimize where they have privileged access. * **Periodically Audit AD permissions**   to ensure users do not have excessive permissions and have not been added to admin groups. * **Evaluate which administrative groups should administer which servers/workstations**   . Ensure group members administrative accounts instead of standard accounts. * **Separate administrator accounts from user accounts**   \\[  [CPG 1\\.5](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ]. Only allow designated admin accounts to be used for admin purposes. If an individual user needs administrative rights over their workstation, use a separate account that does not have administrative access to other hosts, such as servers. * **Consider using a privileged access management (PAM) solution**   to manage access to privileged accounts and resources    \\[   [CPG 3\\.4](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)   ]. PAM solutions can also log and alert usage to detect any unusual activity and may have helped stop the red team from accessing resources with admin accounts.  **Note:**   password vaults associated with PAM solutions should be treated as HVAs with additional restrictions and monitoring (see below). * **Configure time\\-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher**   . For example, the just\\-in\\-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege, as well as the Zero Trust model. This is a process in which a network\\-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable administrator accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. When individual users need the account, they submit their requests through an automated process that enables access to a system but only for a set timeframe to support task completion. || Hosts with  `Unconstrained Delegation`   enabled | * **Remove**  `Unconstrained Delegation` **from all servers**   . If  `Unconstrained Delegation`   functionality is required, upgrade operating systems and applications to leverage other approaches (e.g.,  `constrained delegation`   ) or explore whether systems can be retired or further isolated from the enterprise. CISA recommends Windows Server 2019 or greater. * **Consider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication**   if possible, including using their use as criteria for prioritizing updates to legacy systems or for segmenting the network. Instead use more modern federation protocols (SAML, OIDC) or Kerberos for authentication with AES\\-256 bit encryption    \\[   [CPG 3\\.4](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ]. * If NTLM must be enabled,  **enable Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA)**   to prevent some NTLM\\-relay  **attacks, and implement SMB signing**   to prevent certain adversary\\-in\\-the\\-middle and pass\\-the\\-hash attacks  [CPG 3\\.4](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf \"CPG Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2022\")   ].

CISA encourages organizational IT leadership to ask their executive leadership the question: Can the organization accept the business risk of NOT implementing critical security controls such as MFA? Risks of that nature should typically be acknowledged and prioritized at the most senior levels of an organization.#### **VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS** In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT\\&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT\\&CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started:1. Select an ATT\\&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 3\\).2. Align your security technologies against the technique.3. Test your technologies against the technique.4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies\u2019 performance.5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. CISA recommends continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques identified in this advisory.#### **RESOURCES** See CISA\u2019s [RedEye tool on CISA\u2019s GitHub page](https://github.com/cisagov/RedEye/ \"cisagov / RedEye\")  .
