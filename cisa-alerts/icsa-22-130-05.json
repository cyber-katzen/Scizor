EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.4\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: AVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere and AVEVA Plant SCADA Access Anywhere\nVulnerability: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated user to escape from the context of the streamed application into the OS and launch arbitrary OS commands.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAVEVA reports this vulnerability affects the following HMI products:\u00a0\n\nAVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere: All versions\u00a0\nAVEVA Plant SCADA Access Anywhere (formerly known as AVEVA Citect Anywhere and Schneider Electric Citect Anywhere): All versions\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF RESOURCE TO WRONG SPHERE CWE-668\nWindows OS can be configured to overlay a \u201clanguage bar\u201d on top of any application. When this OS functionality is enabled, the OS language bar UI will be viewable in the browser alongside the InTouch Access Anywhere and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere applications. It is possible to manipulate the Windows OS language bar to launch an OS command prompt, resulting in a context-escape from application into OS.\nCVE-2022-1467 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nGiovanni Delvecchio from Aceaspa reported this vulnerability to AVEVA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA recommends the following mitigations:\u00a0\n\nDisable the Windows language bar on the server machine hosting InTouch Access Anywhere and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere applications unless it is required.\nCreate unique user accounts with minimal privileges dedicated only to remote access of InTouch Access Anywhere and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere applications.\nUtilize OS group policy objects (GPOs) to further restrict what those unique user accounts are allowed to do.\nRestrict access based on Microsoft\u2019s recommended block list.\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, including security updates, please see security bulletin AVEVA-2022-001\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nEnsure the least-privilege user principle is followed.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\n",
