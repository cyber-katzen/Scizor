EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 9.3\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: LenelS2\nEquipment: NetBox\nVulnerabilities: Use of Hard-coded Password, OS Command Injection, Argument Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and execute malicious commands with elevated permissions\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following products of LenelS2, a Carrier Brand, are affected:\n\nNetBox: All versions prior to 5.6.2\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259\nLenelS2 NetBox access control and event monitoring system was discovered to contain hard-coded credentials in versions prior to and including 5.6.1, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication requirements.\nCVE-2024-2420 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-2420. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78\nLenelS2 NetBox access control and event monitoring system was discovered to contain an unauthenticated remote code execution in versions prior to and including 5.6.1, which allows an attacker to execute malicious commands with elevated permissions.\nCVE-2024-2421 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-2421. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L).\n3.2.3 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88\nLenelS2 NetBox access control and event monitoring system was discovered to contain an authenticated remote code execution in versions prior to and including 5.6.1, which allows an attacker to execute malicious commands.\nCVE-2024-2422 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-2422. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nNoam Moshe of Claroty Team82 reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThese vulnerabilities have been mitigated in NetBox release 5.6.2. It is strongly recommended that users upgrade to NetBox release 5.6.2 by contacting their authorized installer.Users should follow recommended deployment guidelines found in the NetBox hardening guide found in the NetBox built-in help menu.\nFor more information, see Carrier's security bulletin for LenelS2.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
