SUMMARY\n-----------\n\n\n\n This advisory identifies vulnerabilities affecting versions of the Dominion Voting Systems Democracy Suite ImageCast X, which is an in\\-person voting system used to allow voters to mark their ballot. The ImageCast X can be configured to allow a voter to produce a paper record or to record votes electronically. While these vulnerabilities present risks that should be mitigated as soon as possible, CISA has no evidence that these vulnerabilities have been exploited in any elections.\n \n\n\n\n Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would require physical access to individual ImageCast X devices, access to the Election Management System (EMS), or the ability to modify files before they are uploaded to ImageCast X devices. Jurisdictions can prevent and/or detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities by diligently applying the mitigations recommended in this advisory, including technical, physical, and operational controls that limit unauthorized access or manipulation of voting systems. Many of these mitigations are already typically standard practice in jurisdictions where these devices are in use and can be enhanced to further guard against exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n2\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n---------------------\n\n\n### 2\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n\n\n\n The following versions of the Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X software are known to be affected (other versions were not able to be tested):\n \n\n\n* ImageCast X firmware based on Android 5\\.1, as used in Dominion Democracy Suite Voting System Version 5\\.5\\-A\n* ImageCast X application Versions 5\\.5\\.10\\.30 and 5\\.5\\.10\\.32, as used in Dominion Democracy Suite Voting System Version 5\\.5\\-A\n\t+ **NOTE:** \n\t After following the vendor\u2019s procedure to upgrade the ImageCast X from Version 5\\.5\\.10\\.30 to 5\\.5\\.10\\.32, or after performing other Android administrative actions, the ImageCast X may be left in a configuration that could allow an attacker who can attach an external input device to escalate privileges and/or install malicious code. Instructions to check for and mitigate this condition are available from Dominion Voting Systems.\n\n\n\n Any jurisdictions running ImageCast X are encouraged to contact Dominion Voting Systems to understand the vulnerability status of their specific implementation.\n \n\n\n### 2\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n**NOTE:** \n Mitigations to reduce the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities can be found in Section 3 of this document.\n \n\n\n#### 2\\.2\\.1\n [IMPROPER VERIFICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE CWE\\-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)\n\n\n\n The tested version of ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate.

Alex Halderman, University of Michigan, and Drew Springall, Auburn University, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n \n\n\n3\\. MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n CISA recommends election officials continue to take and further enhance defensive measures to reduce the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, for each election, election officials should:\n \n\n\n* Contact Dominion Voting Systems to determine which software and/or firmware updates need to be applied. Dominion Voting Systems reports to CISA that the above vulnerabilities have been addressed in subsequent software versions.\n* Ensure all affected devices are physically protected before, during, and after voting.\n* Ensure compliance with chain of custody procedures throughout the election cycle.\n* Ensure that ImageCast X and the Election Management System (EMS) are not connected to any external (i.e., Internet accessible) networks.\n* Ensure carefully selected protective and detective physical security measures (for example, locks and tamper\\-evident seals) are implemented on all affected devices, including on connected devices such as printers and connecting cables.\n* Close any background application windows on each ImageCast X device.\n* Use read\\-only media to update software or install files onto ImageCast X devices.\n* Use separate, unique passcodes for each poll worker card.\n* Ensure all ImageCast X devices are subjected to rigorous pre\\- and post\\-election testing.\n* Disable the \u201cUnify Tabulator Security Keys\u201d feature on the election management system and ensure new cryptographic keys are used for each election.\n* As recommended by Dominion Voting Systems, use the supplemental method to validate hashes on applications, audit log exports, and application exports.\n* Encourage voters to verify the human\\-readable votes on printout.\n* Conduct rigorous post\\-election tabulation audits of the human\\-readable portions of physical ballots and paper records, to include reviewing ballot chain of custody and conducting voter/ballot reconciliation procedures. These activities are especially crucial to detect attacks where the listed vulnerabilities are exploited such that a barcode is manipulated to be tabulated inconsistently with the human\\-readable portion of the paper ballot. (\n **NOTE:** \n If states and jurisdictions so choose, the ImageCast X provides the configuration option to produce ballots that do not print barcodes for tabulation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This product is provided subject to this\n [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\") \n and this\n [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\") \n policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n------\n\n\n\n* Dominion Voting Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease share your thoughts\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n We recently updated our anonymous\n [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-22-154-01) \n ; we\u2019d welcome your feedback.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Advisories\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-01\n \n\n### [Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT MaiLab](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 18, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-200\\-02\n \n\n### [Subnet Solutions PowerSYSTEM Center](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-200-02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 16, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-198\\-01\n \n\n### [Rockwell Automation Pavilion 8](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-198-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jul 11, 2024\n \n\n\n ICS Advisory \\| ICSA\\-24\\-193\\-01\n \n\n### [Siemens Remote Connect Server](/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-193-01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Return to top](#) \n\n\n\n\n* [Topics](/topics)\n* [Spotlight](/spotlight)\n* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)\n* [News \\& Events](/news-events)\n* [Careers](/careers)\n* [About](/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")\n\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CISA)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CISAgov)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cisagov)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cisagov)\n* [RSS](/subscribe-updates-cisa)\n\n\n\n\n CISA Central\n \n[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) \n[SayCISA@cisa.gov](mailto:SayCISA@cisa.gov) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DHS Seal\n \n\n\n CISA.gov\n \n\n An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n \n\n\n* [About CISA](/about \"About CISA\")\n* [Budget and Performance](https://www.dhs.gov/performance-financial-reports \"Budget and Performance\")\n* [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov \"Department of Homeland Security\")\n* [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")\n* [FOIA Requests](https://www.dhs.gov/foia \"FOIA Requests\")\n* [No FEAR Act](/no-fear-act \"No FEAR Act Reporting\")\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ \"Office of Inspector General\")\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy \"Privacy Policy\")\n* [Subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCISA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSCISA_138 \"Subscribe to Email Updates\")\n* [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \"The White House\")\n* [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/ \"USA.gov\")\n* [Website Feedback](/forms/feedback \"Website Feedback\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "cves": ["CVE-2022-1740", "CVE-2022-1747", "CVE-2022-1743", "CVE-2022-1744", "CVE-2022-1746", "CVE-2022-1739", "CVE-2022-1745", "CVE-2022-1742", "CVE-2022-1741"], "techniques": [], "advisory": "icsa-22-154-01", "title": "Vulnerabilities Affecting Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X | CISA", "source": "ics-advisories", "id": "1aa9fe323ab7f5489cb09a788dbdc31c7adc50845d2945d65eb51734e688bd05"}
