EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 6\\.1*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Siemens* **Equipment:**  LOGO!* **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate a firmware update and flash the modified update to the device.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of LOGO!, a programmable logic controller, are affected:* LOGO! 8 BM (including SIPLUS variants): All versions prior to 8\\.3### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE\\-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html) All LOGO! 8 BM (including SIPLUS variants) versions prior to 8\\.3 load firmware updates without checking their authenticity; the integrity of the unencrypted firmware is only verified by a non\\-cryptographic method. This could allow an attacker to manipulate a firmware update and flash the modified update to the device.[CVE\\-2022\\-36360](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-36360)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6\\.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Transportation Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Germany### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Cyber Research Group from Raytheon UK reported this vulnerability to Siemens.4\\.
