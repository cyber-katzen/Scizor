EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Davolink\nEquipment: DVW-3200N\nVulnerability: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a remote attacker obtaining the password to the device.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DVW-3200N, a networking switch, are affected:\n\nDVW-3200N all version prior to Version 1.00.06\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF PASSWORD HASH WITH INSUFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT CWE-916\nThe device generates a weak password hash that is easily cracked, allowing a remote attacker to obtain the password for the device.\nCVE-2018-10618 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Information Technology\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Asia and Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: South Korea\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAnkit Anubhav of NewSky Security reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nDavolink has produced a new firmware version for the device that can be downloaded from:\nhttp://www.davolink.co.kr/sys/bbs/board.php?bo_table=0403&wr_id=50\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
