MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi ABB Power Grids has published an [advisory for eSOMS](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107991A8942&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)  and recommends users to update affected products as soon as possible. The following mitigations were developed to address the vulnerability:* eSOMS version 6\\.0\\.4\\.2\\.2* eSOMS version 6\\.1\\.4* eSOMS version 6\\.3 For additional information and support, contact a product provider or Hitachi ABB Power Grids service organization. For contact information, see [Hitachi ABB Power Grids contact\\-centers](https://www.hitachiabb-powergrids.com/contact-us/)  . Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect an organization network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include ensuring critical systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that must be evaluated case by case. Critical systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e\\-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  .
