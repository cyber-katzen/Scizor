Ensure logging is turned on for application, access, and security logs and store logs in a central system.\n4. Plan \u201cend of life\u201d for technology beyond manufacturer\u2019s supported lifecycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **SUMMARY**\n\n\n\n The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) state\\-sponsored cyber actors are seeking to pre\\-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.\n \n\n\n\n CISA, NSA, FBI and the following partners are releasing this advisory to warn critical infrastructure organizations about this assessment, which is based on observations from the U.S. authoring agencies\u2019 incident response activities at critical infrastructure organizations compromised by the PRC state\\-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon (also known as Vanguard Panda, BRONZE SILHOUETTE, Dev\\-0391, UNC3236, Voltzite, and Insidious Taurus):\n \n\n\n* U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n* U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n* U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA)\n* Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s (ASD\u2019s) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\n* Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)\n* United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC\\-UK)\n* New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC\\-NZ)\n\n\n\n The U.S. authoring agencies have confirmed that Volt Typhoon has compromised the IT environments of multiple critical infrastructure organizations\u2014primarily in\n [Communications](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/communications-sector \"Communications Sector\") \n ,\n [Energy](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/energy-sector \"Energy Sector\") \n ,\n [Transportation Systems](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/transportation-systems-sector \"Transportation Systems Sector\") \n , and\n [Water and Wastewater Systems](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/water-and-wastewater-sector \"Water and Wastewater Systems\") \n Sectors\u2014in the continental and non\\-continental United States and its territories, including Guam. Volt Typhoon\u2019s choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre\\-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions. The U.S. authoring agencies are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts. CCCS assesses that the direct threat to Canada\u2019s critical infrastructure from PRC state\\-sponsored actors is likely lower than that to U.S. infrastructure, but should U.S. infrastructure be disrupted, Canada would likely be affected as well, due to cross\\-border integration. ASD\u2019s ACSC and NCSC\\-NZ assess Australian and New Zealand critical infrastructure, respectively, could be vulnerable to similar activity from PRC state\\-sponsored actors.\n \n\n\n\n As the authoring agencies have\n [previously highlighted](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a \"People's Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection\") \n , the use of living off the land (LOTL) techniques is a hallmark of Volt Typhoon actors\u2019 malicious cyber activity when targeting critical infrastructure. The group also relies on valid accounts and leverage strong operational security, which combined, allows for long\\-term undiscovered persistence. In fact, the U.S. authoring agencies have recently observed indications of Volt Typhoon actors maintaining access and footholds within some victim IT environments for at least five years. Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre\\-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim\u2019s environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise.\n \n\n\n\n The authoring agencies urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the mitigations in this advisory and to hunt for similar malicious activity using the guidance herein provided, along with the recommendations found in joint guide\n [Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques \"Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques\") \n . These mitigations are primarily intended for IT and OT administrators in critical infrastructure organizations. Following the mitigations for prevention of or in response to an incident will help disrupt Volt Typhoon\u2019s accesses and reduce the threat to critical infrastructure entities.\n \n\n\n\n If activity is identified, the authoring agencies strongly recommend that critical infrastructure organizations apply the incident response recommendations in this advisory and report the incident to the relevant agency (see Contact Information section).\n \n\n\n\n For additional information, see joint advisory\n [People\u2019s Republic of China State\\-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a \"People\u2019s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection\") \n and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release\n [U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People\u2019s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical \"U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People\u2019s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure\") \n .

Since then, CISA, NSA, and FBI have determined that this activity is part of a broader campaign in which Volt Typhoon actors have successfully infiltrated the networks of critical infrastructure organizations in the continental and non\\-continental United States and its territories, including Guam.\n \n\n\n\n The U.S. authoring agencies have primarily observed compromises linked to Volt Typhoon in\n [Communications](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/communications-sector \"Communications Sector\") \n ,\n [Energy](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/energy-sector \"Energy Sector\") \n ,\n [Transportation Systems](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/transportation-systems-sector \"Transportation Systems Sector\") \n , and\n [Water and Wastewater Systems](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/water-and-wastewater-sector \"Water and Wastewater Systems\") \n sector organizations\u2019 IT networks. Some victims are smaller organizations with limited cybersecurity capabilities that provide critical services to larger organizations or key geographic locations.\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors tailor their TTPs to the victim environment; however, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed the actors typically following the same pattern of behavior across identified intrusions. Their choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre\\-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable the disruption of OT functions across multiple critical infrastructure sectors (see Figure 1\\).\n \n\n\n1. **Volt Typhoon conducts extensive pre\\-compromise reconnaissance to learn about the target organization\u2019s network architecture and operational protocols.** \n This reconnaissance includes identifying network topologies, security measures, typical user behaviors, and key network and IT staff. The intelligence gathered by Volt Typhoon actors is likely leveraged to enhance their operational security. For example, in some instances, Volt Typhoon actors may have abstained from using compromised credentials outside of normal working hours to avoid triggering security alerts on abnormal account activities.\n2. **Volt Typhoon typically gains initial access to the IT network by exploiting known or zero\\-day vulnerabilities in public\\-facing network** \n appliances (e.g., routers, virtual private networks \\[VPNs], and firewalls) and then connects to the victim\u2019s network via VPN for follow\\-on activities.\n3. **Volt Typhoon aims to obtain administrator credentials within the network, often by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the operating system or network services.** \n In some cases, Volt Typhoon has obtained credentials insecurely stored on a public\\-facing network appliance.\n4. **Volt Typhoon uses valid administrator credentials to move laterally to the domain controller (DC) and other devices** \n via remote access services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\n5. **Volt Typhoon conducts discovery in the victim\u2019s network, leveraging LOTL binaries for stealth** \n . A key tactic includes using PowerShell to perform targeted queries on Windows event logs, focusing on specific users and periods. These queries facilitate the discreet extraction of security event logs into\n `.dat` \n files, allowing Volt Typhoon actors to gather critical information while minimizing detection. This strategy, blending in\\-depth pre\\-compromise reconnaissance with meticulous post\\-exploitation intelligence collection, underscores their sophisticated and strategic approach to cyber operations.\n6. **Volt Typhoon achieves full domain compromise by extracting the Active Directory database (** \n`NTDS.dit` \n**) from the DC.** \n Volt Typhoon frequently employs the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) using command\\-line utilities such as\n `vssadmin` \n to access\n `NTDS.dit` \n . The\n `NTDS.dit` \n file is a centralized repository that contains critical Active Directory data, including user accounts, passwords (in hashed form), and other sensitive data, which can be leveraged for further exploitation. This method entails the creation of a shadow copy\u2014a point\\-in\\-time snapshot\u2014of the volume hosting the\n `NTDS.dit` \n file. By leveraging this snapshot, Volt Typhoon actors effectively bypass the file locking mechanisms inherent in a live Windows environment, which typically prevent direct access to the\n `NTDS.dit` \n file while the domain controller is operational.\n7. **Volt Typhoon likely uses offline password cracking techniques to decipher these hashes.** \n This process involves extracting the hashes from the\n `NTDS.dit` \n file and then applying various password cracking methods, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or more sophisticated techniques like rainbow tables to uncover the plaintext passwords. The successful decryption of these passwords allows Volt Typhoon actors to obtain elevated access and further infiltrate and manipulate the network.\n8. **Volt Typhoon uses elevated credentials for strategic network infiltration and additional discovery, often focusing on gaining capabilities to access OT assets.** \n Volt Typhoon actors have been observed testing access to domain\\-joint OT assets using default OT vendor credentials, and in certain instances, they have possessed the capability to access OT systems whose credentials were compromised via\n `NTDS.dit` \n theft. This access enables potential disruptions, such as manipulating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in server rooms or disrupting critical energy and water controls, leading to significant infrastructure failures (in some cases, Volt Typhoon actors had the capability to access camera surveillance systems at critical infrastructure facilities). In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors moved laterally to a control system and were positioned to move to a second control system.\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 1: Typical Volt Typhoon Activity](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2024-02/Figure%201%20-%20Typical%20Volt%20Typhoon%20Activity.png?itok=bELDFw9R)\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 1: Typical Volt Typhoon Activity* \n\n\n\n\n\n After successfully gaining access to legitimate accounts, Volt Typhoon actors exhibit minimal activity within the compromised environment (except discovery as noted above), suggesting their objective is to maintain persistence rather than immediate exploitation. This assessment is supported by observed patterns where Volt Typhoon methodically re\\-targets the same organizations over extended periods, often spanning several years, to continuously validate and potentially enhance their unauthorized accesses. Evidence of their meticulous approach is seen in instances where they repeatedly exfiltrate domain credentials, ensuring access to current and valid accounts. For example, in one compromise, Volt Typhoon likely extracted\n `NTDS.dit` \n from three domain controllers in a four\\-year period. In another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors extracted\n `NTDS.dit` \n two times from a victim in a nine\\-month period.\n \n\n\n\n Industry reporting\u2014identifying that Volt Typhoon actors are silent on the network following credential dumping and perform discovery to learn about the environment, but do not exfiltrate data\u2014is consistent with the U.S. authoring agencies\u2019 observations. This indicates their aim is to achieve and maintain persistence on the network. In one confirmed compromise, an industry partner observed Volt Typhoon actors dumping credentials at regular intervals.\n \n\n\n\n In addition to leveraging stolen account credentials, the actors use LOTL techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts. Their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long\\-term, undiscovered persistence. Further, Volt Typhoon\u2019s operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment.\n \n\n\n\n See the below sections for Volt Typhoon TTPs observed by the U.S. authoring agencies from multiple confirmed Volt Typhoon compromises.\n \n\n\n#### **Observed TTPs**\n\n\n##### ***Reconnaissance***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre\\-compromise reconnaissance \\[\n [TA0043](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0043/ \"Reconnaissance\") \n ] to learn about the target organization \\[\n [T1591](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1591/ \"Gather Victim Org Information\") \n ], its network \\[\n [T1590](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1590/ \"Gather Victim Network Information\") \n ], and its staff \\[\n [T1589](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information\") \n ].

According to industry reporting, Volt Typhoon actors use FOFA\\[\n [1](https://fofa.info/ \"FOFA Search Engine\") \n ], Shodan, and Censys for querying or searching for exposed infrastructure. In some instances, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon actors targeting the personal emails of key network and IT staff \\[\n [T1589\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/002/ \"Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses\") \n ] post compromise.\n \n\n\n##### ***Resource Development***\n\n\n\n Historically, Volt Typhoon actors use multi\\-hop proxies for command and control (C2\\) infrastructure \\[\n [T1090\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1090/003/ \"Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy\") \n ]. The proxy is typically composed of virtual private servers (VPSs) \\[\n [T1583\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1583/005/ \"Acquire Infrastructure: Botnet\") \n ] or small office/home office (SOHO) routers. Recently, Volt Typhoon actors used Cisco and NETGEAR end\\-of\\-life SOHO routers implanted with KV Botnet malware to support their operations \\[\n [T1584\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1584/005/ \"Compromise Infrastructure: Botnet\") \n ].

They often use publicly available exploit code for known vulnerabilities \\[\n [T1588\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1588/005/ \"Obtain Capabilities: Exploits\") \n ] but are also adept at discovering and exploiting zero\\-day vulnerabilities \\[\n [T1587\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1587/004/ \"Develop Capabilities: Exploits\") \n ].\n \n\n\n* In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors likely obtained initial access by exploiting\n [CVE\\-2022\\-42475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42475 \"CVE-2022-42475\") \n in a network perimeter FortiGate 300D firewall that was not patched. There is evidence of a buffer overflow attack identified within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\\-VPN crash logs.\n\n\n\n Once initial access is achieved, Volt Typhoon actors typically shift to establishing persistent access \\[\n [TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0003/ \"Persistence\") \n ]. They often use VPN sessions to securely connect to victim environments \\[\n [T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1133/ \"External Remote Services\") \n ], enabling discreet follow\\-on intrusion activities. This tactic not only provides a stable foothold in the network but also allows them to blend in with regular traffic, significantly reducing their chances of detection.\n \n\n\n##### ***Execution***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors rarely use malware for post\\-compromise execution. Instead, once Volt Typhoon actors gain access to target environments, they use hands\\-on\\-keyboard activity via the command\\-line \\[\n [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\") \n ] and other native tools and processes on systems \\[\n [T1218](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1218/ \"System Binary Proxy Execution\") \n ] (often referred to as \u201cLOLBins\u201d), known as LOTL, to maintain and expand access to the victim networks. According to industry reporting, some \u201ccommands appear to be exploratory or experimental, as the operators \\[i.e., malicious actors] adjust and repeat them multiple times.\u201d\\[\n [2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/ \"Volt Typhoon targets US critical infrastructure with living-off-the-land techniques\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n For more details on LOTL activity, see the Credential Access and Discovery sections and Appendix A: Volt Typhoon LOTL Activity.\n \n\n\n\n Similar to LOTL, Volt Typhoon actors also use legitimate but outdated versions of network admin tools. For example, in one confirmed compromise, actors downloaded \\[\n [T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1105/ \"Ingress Tool Transfer\") \n ] an outdated version of\n `comsvcs.dll` \n on the DC in a non\\-standard folder.\n `comsvcs.dll` \n is a legitimate Microsoft Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file normally found in the\n `System32` \n folder. The actors used this DLL with\n `MiniDump` \n and the process ID of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to dump the LSASS process memory \\[\n [T1003\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/001/ \"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\") \n ] and obtain credentials (LSASS process memory space contains hashes for the current user\u2019s operating system (OS) credentials).\n \n\n\n\n The actors also use legitimate non\\-native network admin and forensic tools. For example, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using Magnet RAM Capture (MRC) version 1\\.20 on domain controllers. MRC is a free imaging tool that captures the physical memory of a computer, and Volt Typhoon actors likely used it to analyze in\\-memory data for sensitive information (such as credentials) and in\\-transit data not typically accessible on disk. Volt Typhoon actors have also been observed implanting Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control.\\[\n [3](https://github.com/fatedier/frp \"fatedier / frp\") \n ] (See the Command and Control section).\n \n\n\n##### ***Persistence***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon primarily relies on valid credentials for persistence \\[\n [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/ \"Valid Accounts\") \n ].\n \n\n\n##### ***Defense Evasion***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon has strong operational security. Their actors primarily use LOTL for defense evasion \\[\n [TA0005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0005/ \"Defense Evasion\") \n ], which allows them to camouflage their malicious activity with typical system and network behavior, potentially circumventing simplistic endpoint security capabilities. For more information, see joint guide\n [Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques \"Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors also obfuscate their malware. In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon obfuscated FRP client files (\n `BrightmetricAgent.exe` \n and\n `SMSvcService.exe` \n ) and the command\\-line port scanning utility ScanLine by packing the files with Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) \\[\n [T1027\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1027/002/ \"Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\") \n ]. FRP client applications support encryption, compression, and easy token authentication and work across multiple protocols\u2014including transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). The FRP client applications use the Kuai connection protocol (KCP) for error\\-checked and anonymous data stream delivery over UDP, with packet\\-level encryption support. See Appendix C and CISA Malware Analysis Report\n [(MAR)\\-10448362\\-1\\.v1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar24-038a \"MAR-10448362-1.v1 Volt Typhoon\") \n for more information.\n \n\n\n\n In addition to LOTL and obfuscation techniques, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed selectively clearing Windows Event Logs \\[\n [T1070\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\") \n ], system logs, and other technical artifacts to remove evidence \\[\n [T1070\\.009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/009/ \"Indicator Removal: Clear Persistence\") \n ] of their intrusion activity and masquerading file names \\[\n [T1036\\.005](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1036/005/ \"Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location\") \n ].\n \n\n\n##### ***Credential Access***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors first obtain credentials from public\\-facing appliances after gaining initial access by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities \\[\n [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1068/ \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\") \n ] in the operating system or network services.\n \n In some cases, they have obtained credentials insecurely stored on the appliance \\[\n [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/ \"Unsecured Credentials\") \n ]. In one instance, where Volt Typhoon likely exploited CVE\\-2022\\-42475 in an unpatched Fortinet device, Volt Typhoon actors compromised a domain admin account stored inappropriately on the device.\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon also consistently obtains valid credentials by extracting the Active Directory database file (\n `NTDS.dit` \n )\u2014in some cases multiple times from the same victim over long periods \\[\n [T1003\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/003/ \"OS Credential Dumping: NTDS\") \n ].\n `NTDS.dit` \n contains usernames, hashed passwords, and group memberships for all domain accounts, essentially allowing for full domain compromise if the hashes can be cracked offline.\n \n\n\n\n To obtain\n `NTDS.dit` \n , the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon:\n \n\n\n1. Move laterally \\[\n [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0008/ \"Lateral Movement\") \n ] to the domain controller via an interactive RDP session using a compromised account with domain administrator privileges \\[\n [T1021\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/001/ \"Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\") \n ];\n2. Execute the Windows\\-native\n `vssadmin` \n \\[\n [T1006](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1006/ \"Direct Volume Access\") \n ] command to create a volume shadow copy;\n3. Use Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC) commands \\[\n [T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1047/ \"Windows Management Instrumentation\") \n ] to execute\n `ntdsutil` \n (a LOTL utility) to copy\n `NTDS.dit` \n and\n `SYSTEM` \n registry hive from the volume shadow copy; and\n4. Exfiltrate \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ]\n `NTDS.dit` \n and\n `SYSTEM` \n registry hive to crack passwords offline) \\[\n [T1110\\.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1110/002/ \"Brute Force: Password Cracking\") \n ]. (For more details, including specific commands used, see Appendix A: Volt Typhoon LOTL Activity.)\n   \n\n**Note:** \n A volume shadow copy contains a copy of all the files and folders that exist on the specified volume. Each volume shadow copy created on a DC includes its\n `NTDS.dit` \n and the\n `SYSTEM` \n registry hive, which provides keys to decrypt the\n `NTDS.dit` \n file.\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors have also been observed interacting with a PuTTY application by enumerating existing stored sessions \\[\n [T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1012/ \"Query Registry\") \n ]. Given this interaction and the exposure of cleartext\\-stored proxy passwords used in remote administration, Volt Typhoon actors potentially had access to PuTTY profiles that allow access to critical systems (see the Lateral Movement section).\n \n\n\n\n According to industry reporting, Volt Typhoon actors attempted to dump credentials through LSASS (see Appendix B for commands used).\\[\n [2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/ \"Volt Typhoon targets US critical infrastructure with living-off-the-land techniques\") \n ]\n \n\n\n\n The U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon actors leveraging\n [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0002/ \"Mimikatz\") \n to harvest credentials, and industry partners have observed Volt Typhoon leveraging\n [Impacket](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0357/ \"Impacket\") \n\n .\n \n \\[\n [2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/ \"Volt Typhoon targets US critical infrastructure with living-off-the-land techniques\") \n ]\n \n\n\n* Mimikatz is a credential dumping tool and Volt Typhoon actors use it to obtain credentials. In one confirmed compromise, the Volt Typhoon used RDP to connect to a server and run Mimikatz after leveraging a compromised administrator account to deploy it.\n* Impacket is an open source Python toolkit for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains tools for Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks\u2014as well as remote service execution.\n\n\n##### ***Discovery***\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using commercial tools, LOTL utilities, and appliances already present on the system for system information \\[\n [T1082](http://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1082/ \"System Information Discovery\") \n ], network service \\[\n [T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1046/ \"Network Service Discovery\") \n ], group \\[\n [T1069](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/ \"Permission Groups Discovery\") \n ] and user \\[\n [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1033/ \"System Owner/User Discovery\") \n ] discovery.\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon uses at least the following LOTL tools and commands for system information, network service, group, and user discovery techniques:\n \n\n\n\n\n| * cmd * certutil * dnscmd * ldifde * makecab * net user/group/use * netsh | * nltest * netstat * ntdsutil * ping * PowerShell * quser * reg query/reg save | * systeminfo * tasklist * wevtutil * whoami * wmic * xcopy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n\n\n Some observed specific examples of discovery include:\n \n\n\n* Capturing successful logon events \\[\n [T1654](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1654/ \"Log Enumeration\") \n ].\n\t+ Specifically, in one incident, analysis of the PowerShell console history of a domain controller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file named\n\t `user.dat` \n\t , as evidenced by the executed command\n\t `Get-EventLog security -instanceid 4624 -after [year-month-date] | fl * | Out-File 'C:\\users\\public\\documents\\user.dat'` \n\t . This indicates the group's specific interest in capturing successful logon events (event ID\n\t `4624` \n\t ) to analyze user authentication patterns within the network. Additionally, file system analysis, specifically of the Master File Table (MFT), uncovered evidence of a separate file,\n\t `systeminfo.dat` \n\t , which was created in\n\t `C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents` \n\t but subsequently deleted \\[\n\t [T1070\\.004](https:/attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/004/ \"Indicator Removal: File Deletion\") \n\t ]. The presence of these activities suggests a methodical approach by Volt Typhoon actors in collecting and then possibly removing traces of sensitive log information from the compromised system.\n* Executing\n `tasklist /v` \n to gather a detailed process listing \\[\n [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1057/ \"Process Discovery\") \n ], followed by executing\n `taskkill /f /im rdpservice.exe` \n (the function of this executable is not known).\n* Executing\n `net user` \n and\n `quser` \n for user account information \\[\n [T1087\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1087/001/) \n ].\n* Creating and accessing a file named\n `rult3uil.log` \n on a domain controller in\n `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` \n . The\n `rult3uil.log` \n file contained user activities on a compromised system, showcasing a combination of window title information \\[\n [T1010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1010/ \"Application Window Discovery\") \n ] and focus shifts, keypresses, and command executions across Google Chrome and Windows PowerShell, with corresponding timestamps.\n* Employing\n `ping` \n with various IP addresses to check network connectivity \\[\n [T1016\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/001/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery: Internet Connection Discovery\") \n ] and\n `net start` \n to list running services \\[\n [T1007](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1007/ \"System Service Discovery\") \n ].\n\n\n\n See Appendix A for additional LOTL examples.\n \n\n\n\n In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors attempted to use Advanced IP Scanner, which was on the network for admin use, to scan the network.\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors have been observed strategically targeting network administrator web browser data\u2014focusing on both browsing history and stored credentials \\[\n [T1555\\.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1555/003/ \"Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers\") \n ]\u2014to facilitate targeting of personal email addresses (see the Reconnaissance section) for further discovery and possible network modifications that may impact the threat actor\u2019s persistence within victim networks.\n \n\n\n\n In one confirmed compromise:\n \n\n\n* Volt Typhoon actors obtained the history file from the\n `User Data` \n directory of a network administrator user\u2019s Chrome browser. To obtain the history file, Volt Typhoon actors first executed an RDP session to the user\u2019s workstation where they initially attempted, and failed, to obtain the\n `C$ File Name: users\\{redacted}\\appdata\\local\\Google\\Chrome\\UserData\\default\\History` \n file, as evidenced by the accompanying\n `1016` \n (reopen failed) SMB error listed in the application event log. The threat actors then disconnected the RDP session to the workstation and accessed the file\n `C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\Downloads\\History.zip` \n . This file presumably contained data from the User Data directory of the user\u2019s Chrome browser, which the actors likely saved in the Downloads directory for exfiltration \\[\n [T1074](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1074/ \"Data Staged\") \n ]. Shortly after accessing the\n `history.zip` \n file, the actors terminated RDP sessions.\n* About four months later, Volt Typhoon actors accessed the same user\u2019s Chrome data\n `C$ File Name: Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local State` \n and\n `$ File Name: Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data` \n via SMB. The Local State file contains the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption key \\[\n [T1552\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/004/ \"Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys\") \n ] used to encrypt the passwords stored in the Chrome browser, which would enable the actors to obtain plaintext passwords stored in the Login Data file in the Chrome browser.\n\n\n\n In another confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors accessed directories containing Chrome and Edge user data on multiple systems. Directory interaction was observed over the network to paths such as\n `C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\` \n and\n `C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\` \n . They also enumerated several directories, including directories containing vulnerability testing and cyber related content and facilities data, such as construction drawings \\[\n [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1083/ \"File and Directory Discovery\") \n ].\n \n\n\n##### ***Lateral Movement***\n\n\n\n For lateral movement, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed predominantly employing RDP with compromised valid administrator credentials.\n **Note:** \n With a full on\\-premises Microsoft Active Directory identity compromise (see the Credential Access section), the group may be capable of using other methods such as Pass the Hash or Pass the Ticket for lateral movement \\[\n [T1550](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1550/ \"Use Alternate Authentication Material\") \n ].\n \n\n\n\n In one confirmed compromise of a Water and Wastewater Systems Sector entity, after obtaining initial access, Volt Typhoon actors connected to the network via a VPN with administrator credentials they obtained and opened an RDP session with the same credentials to move laterally. Over a nine\\-month period, they moved laterally to a file server, a domain controller, an Oracle Management Server (OMS), and a VMware vCenter server. The actors obtained domain credentials from the domain controller and performed discovery, collection, and exfiltration on the file server (see the Discovery and Collection and Exfiltration sections).\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon\u2019s movement to the vCenter server was likely strategic for pre\\-positioning to OT assets. The vCenter server was adjacent to OT assets, and Volt Typhoon actors were observed interacting with the PuTTY application on the server by enumerating existing stored sessions. With this information, Volt Typhoon potentially had access to a range of critical PuTTY profiles, including those for water treatment plants, water wells, an electrical substation, OT systems, and network security devices. This would enable them to access these critical systems \\[\n [T1563](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1563/ \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\") \n ]. See Figure 2\\.\n \n\n\n\n\n![Figure 2: Volt Typhoon Lateral Movement Path File Server, DC, and OT-Adjacent Assets](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2024-02/Figure%202%20-%20Volt%20Typhoon%20Lateral%20Movement%20Path%20File%20Server%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20OT-Adjacent%20Assets.png?itok=RmbI_O55)\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 2: Volt Typhoon Lateral Movement Path File Server, DC, and OT\\-Adjacent Assets* \n\n\n\n\n\n Additionally, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using PSExec to execute remote processes, including the automated acceptance of the end\\-user license agreement (EULA) through an administrative account, signified by the\n `accepteula` \n command flag.\n \n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors may have attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment in one victim\u2019s network but direct attribution to the Volt Typhoon group was inconclusive. During the period of the their known network presence, there were anomalous login attempts to an Azure tenant \\[\n [T1021\\.007](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/007/ \"Remote Services: Cloud Services\") \n ] potentially using credentials \\[\n [T1078\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/004/ \"Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts\") \n ] previously compromised from theft of\n `NTDS.dit` \n . These attempts, coupled with misconfigured virtual machines with open RDP ports, suggested a potential for cloud\\-based lateral movement. However, subsequent investigations, including password changes and multifactor authentication (MFA) implementations, revealed authentication failures from non\\-associated IP addresses, with no definitive link to Volt Typhoon.\n \n\n\n##### ***Collection and Exfiltration***\n\n\n\n The U.S. authoring agencies assess Volt Typhoon primarily collects information that would facilitate follow\\-on actions with physical impacts. For example, in one confirmed compromise, they collected \\[\n [TA0009](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0009/ \"Collection\") \n ] sensitive information obtained from a file server in multiple zipped files \\[\n [T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/ \"Archive Collected Data\") \n ] and likely exfiltrated \\[\n [TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/ \"Exfiltration\") \n ] the files via Server Message Block (SMB) \\[\n [T1048](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1048/ \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\") \n ] (see Figure 3\\). Collected information included diagrams and documentation related to OT equipment, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, relays, and switchgear. This data is crucial for understanding and potentially impacting critical infrastructure systems, indicating a focus on gathering intelligence that could be leveraged in actions targeting physical assets and systems.\n \n\n\n\n\n![Figure 3: Volt Typhoon Attack Path for Exfiltration of Data from File Server](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2024-02/Figure%203%20-%20Volt%20Typhoon%20Attack%20Path%20for%20Exfiltration%20of%20Data%20from%20File%20Server.png?itok=vlIAWkqg)\n\n\n\n\n*Figure 3: Volt Typhoon Attack Path for Exfiltration of Data from File Server* \n\n\n\n\n\n In another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors leveraged WMIC to create and use temporary directories (\n `C:\\Users\\Public\\pro` \n ,\n `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp` \n ,\n `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp\\Active Directory` \n and\n `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp\\registry` \n ) to stage the extracted\n `ntds.dit` \n and\n `SYSTEM` \n registry hives from\n `ntdsutil` \n execution volume shadow copies (see the Credential Access section) obtained from two DCs. They then compressed and archived the extracted\n `ntds.dit` \n and accompanying registry files by executing\n `ronf.exe` \n , which was likely a renamed version of the archive utility\n `rar.exe` \n ) \\[\n [T1560\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/001/ \"Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\") \n ].\n \n\n\n#### **Command and Control**\n\n\n\n Volt Typhoon actors have been observed leveraging compromised SOHO routers and virtual private servers (VPS) to proxy C2 traffic. For more information, see DOJ press release\n [U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People\u2019s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical \"U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People\u2019s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure\") \n ).\n \n\n\n\n They have also been observed setting up FRP clients \\[\n [T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1090/ \"Proxy\") \n ] on a victim\u2019s corporate infrastructure to establish covert communications channels \\[\n [T1573](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1573/ \"Encrypted Channel\") \n ] for command and control. In one instance, Volt Typhoon actors implanted the FRP client with filename\n `SMSvcService.exe` \n on a Shortel Enterprise Contact Center (ECC) server and a second FRP client with filename\n `Brightmetricagent.exe` \n on another server. These clients, when executed via PowerShell \\[\n [T1059\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/001/ \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\") \n ], open reverse proxies between the compromised system and Volt Typhoon C2 servers.\n `Brightmetricagent.exe` \n has additional capabilities. The FRP client can locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through Network Address Translation (NAT) \\[\n [T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/ \"System Network Configuration Discovery\") \n ]. It also contains multiplexer libraries that can bi\\-directionally stream data over NAT networks and contains a command\\-line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh) \\[\n [T1059\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/004 \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell\") \n ]. See Appendix C and\n [MAR\\-10448362\\-1\\.v1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar24-038a \"MAR-10448362-1.v1 Volt Typhoon\") \n for more information.\n \n\n\n\n In the same compromise, Volt Typhoon actors exploited a Paessler Router Traffic Grapher (PRTG) server as an intermediary for their FRP operations. To facilitate this, they used the netsh command, a legitimate Windows command, to create a PortProxy registry modification \\[\n [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1112 \"Modify Registry\") \n ] on the PRTG server \\[\n [T1090\\.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001/ \"Proxy: Internal Proxy\") \n ]. This key alteration redirected specific port traffic to Volt Typhoon\u2019s proxy infrastructure, effectively converting the PRTG\u2019s server into a proxy for their C2 traffic \\[\n [T1584\\.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1584/004/ \"Compromise Infrastructure: Server\") \n ] (see Appendix B for details).\n \n\n\n### **DETECTION/HUNT RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n\n#### **Apply Living off the Land Detection Best Practices**\n\n\n\n**Apply the prioritized detection and hardening best practice recommendations provided in joint guide** \n[**Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques**](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques \"Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques\")\n . Many organizations lack security and network management best practices (such as established baselines) that support detection of malicious LOTL activity\u2014this makes it difficult for network defenders to discern legitimate behavior from malicious behavior and conduct behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting. Conventional IOCs associated with the malicious activity are generally lacking, complicating network defenders\u2019 efforts to identify, track, and categorize this sort of malicious behavior. This advisory provides guidance for a multifaceted cybersecurity strategy that enables behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting, which are part of a comprehensive approach to mitigating cyber threats that employ LOTL techniques.\n \n\n\n\n Review Application, Security, and System Event Logs\n \n\n\n\n**Routinely review application, security, and system event logs, focusing on Windows Extensible Storage Engine Technology (ESENT) Application Logs** \n . Due to Volt Typhoon\u2019s ability for long\\-term undetected persistence, network defenders should assume significant dwell time and review specific application event log IDs, which remain on endpoints for longer periods compared to security event logs and other ephemeral artifacts. Focus on Windows ESENT logs because certain ESENT Application Log event IDs (\n `216` \n ,\n `325` \n ,\n `326` \n , and\n `327` \n ) may indicate actors copying\n `NTDS.dit` \n .\n \n\n\n\n See Table 1 for examples of ESENT and other key log indicators that should be investigated. Please note that incidents may not always have exact matches listed in the Event Detail column due to variations in event logging and TTPs.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n*Table 1: Key Log Indicators for Detecting Volt Typhoon Activity* \n\n| **Event ID (Log)** | **Event Detail** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 216 (Windows ESENT Application Log) | A database location change was detected from 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\NTDS\\\\ntds.dit' to '\\\\\\\\?\\\\GLOBALROOT\\\\Device\\\\{redacted}VolumeShadowCopy1\\\\Windows\\\\NTDS\\\\ntds.dit' | A change in the  `NTDS.dit`   database location is detected.

Developed by Sandia National Labs, gait is a publicly available Zeek\\[\n [5](https://zeek.org/ \"Open Source Network Security Monitoring Tool\") \n ] extension. The\n [gait](https://github.com/sandialabs/gait \"sandialabs / gait\") \n extension can help enrich Zeek\u2019s network connection monitoring and SSL logs by including additional metadata in the logs. Specifically, gait captures unique TCP options and timing data such as a TCP, transport layer security (TLS), and Secure Shell (SSH) layer inferred round trip times (RTT), aiding in the identification of the software used by both endpoints and intermediaries.\n \n\n\n\n While the gait extension for Zeek is an effective tool for enriching network monitoring logs with detailed metadata, it is not specifically designed to detect Volt Typhoon actor activities. The extension\u2019s capabilities extend to general anomaly detection in network traffic, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014proxying activities. Therefore, while gait can be helpful in identifying tactics similar to those used by Volt Typhoon, such as proxy networks and FRP clients for C2 communication, not all proxying activities detected by using this additional metadata are necessarily indicative of Volt Typhoon presence. It serves as a valuable augmentation to current security stacks for a broader spectrum of threat detection.\n \n\n\n\n For more information, see Sandia National Lab\u2019s gait GitHub page\n [sandialabs/gait: Zeek Extension to Collect Metadata for Profiling of Endpoints and Proxies](https://github.com/sandialabs/gait \"sandialabs / gait\") \n .\n \n\n\n#### **Review Logins for Impossible Travel**\n\n\n\n**Examine VPN or other account logon times, frequency, duration, and locations.** \n Logons from two geographically distant locations within a short timeframe from a single user may indicate an account is being used maliciously. Logons of unusual frequency or duration may indicate a threat actor attempting to access a system repeatedly or maintain prolonged sessions for the purpose of data extraction.\n \n\n\n#### **Review Standard Directories for Unusual Files**\n\n\n\n**Review directories, such as** \n`C:\\windows\\temp\\`\n**and** \n`C:\\users\\public\\`\n**, for unexpected or unusual files** \n . Monitor these temporary file storage directories for files typically located in standard system paths, such as the\n `System32` \n directory. For example, Volt Typhoon has been observed downloading\n `comsvcs.dll` \n to a non\\-standard folder (this file is normally found in the\n `System32` \n folder).\n \n\n\n### **INCIDENT RESPONSE**\n\n\n\n If compromise, or potential compromise, is detected,\n **organizations should assume full domain compromise** \n because of Volt Typhoon\u2019s known behavioral pattern of extracting the\n `NTDS.dit` \n from the DCs. Organizations should immediately implement the following immediate, defensive countermeasures:\n \n\n\n1. **Sever the enterprise network from the internet. Note:** \n this step requires the agency to understand its internal and external connections. When making the decision to sever internet access, knowledge of connections must be combined with care to avoid disrupting critical functions.\n\t* If you cannot sever from the internet,\n\t **shutdown all non\\-essential traffic between the affected enterprise network and the internet** \n\t .\n2. **Reset credentials of privileged and non\\-privileged accounts within the trust boundary of each compromised account** \n .\n\t* Reset passwords for all domain users and all local accounts, such as\n\t `Guest` \n\t ,\n\t `HelpAssistant` \n\t ,\n\t `DefaultAccount` \n\t ,\n\t `System` \n\t ,\n\t `Administrator` \n\t , and\n\t `krbtgt` \n\t . The\n\t `krbtgt` \n\t account is responsible for handling Kerberos ticket requests as well as encrypting and signing them. The\n\t `krbtgt` \n\t account should be reset twice because the account has a two\\-password history. The first account reset for the\n\t `krbtgt` \n\t needs to be allowed to replicate prior to the second reset to avoid any issues. See CISA\u2019s\n\t [Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar21-134a \"Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise\") \n\t for more information. Although tailored to FCEB agencies compromised in the\n\t [2020 SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2021/01/07/supply-chain-compromise \"Supply Chain Compromise\") \n\t , the steps are applicable to organizations with Windows AD compromise.\n\t\t+ Review access policies to temporarily revoke privileges/access for affected accounts/devices. If it is necessary to not alert the attacker (e.g., for intelligence purposes), then privileges can be reduced for affected accounts/devices to \u201ccontain\u201d them.\n\t* Reset the relevant account credentials or access keys if the investigation finds the threat actor\u2019s access is limited to non\\-elevated permissions.\n\t\t+ Monitor related accounts, especially administrative accounts, for any further signs of unauthorized access.\n3. **Audit all network appliance and edge device configurations with indicators of malicious activity for signs of unauthorized or malicious configuration changes** \n . Organizations should ensure they audit the current network device running configuration and any local configurations that could be loaded at boot time. If configuration changes are identified:\n\t* Change all credentials being used to manage network devices, to include keys and strings used to secure network device functions (SNMP strings/user credentials, IPsec/IKE preshared keys, routing secrets, TACACS/RADIUS secrets, RSA keys/certificates, etc.).\n\t* Update all firmware and software to the latest version.\n4. **Report the compromise to an authoring agency** \n (see the Contact Information section).\n5. For organizations with cloud or hybrid environments,\n **apply best practices for identity and credential access management.** \n\t* Verify that all accounts with privileged role assignments are cloud native, not synced from Active Directory.\n\t* Audit conditional access policies to ensure Global Administrators and other highly privileged service principals and accounts are not exempted.\n\t* Audit privileged role assignments to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege when assigning privileged roles.\n\t* Leverage just\\-in\\-time and just\\-enough access mechanisms when administrators need to elevate to a privileged role.\n\t* In hybrid environments, ensure federated systems (such as AD FS) are configured and monitored properly.\n\t* Audit Enterprise Applications for recently added applications and examine the API permissions assigned to each.\n6. **Reconnect to the internet.** \n**Note:** \n The decision to reconnect to the internet depends on senior leadership\u2019s confidence in the actions taken. It is possible\u2014depending on the environment\u2014that new information discovered during pre\\-eviction and eviction steps could add additional eviction tasks.\n7. **Minimize and control use of remote access tools and protocols** \n by applying best practices from joint\n [Guide to Securing Remote Access Software](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software \"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\") \n and joint Cybersecurity Information Sheet:\n [Keeping PowerShell: Security Measures to Use and Embrace](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/22/2003021689/-1/-1/0/CSI_KEEPING_POWERSHELL_SECURITY_MEASURES_TO_USE_AND_EMBRACE_20220622.PDF \"Keeping PowerShell: Security Measures to Use and Embrace\") \n .\n8. **Consider sharing technical information with an authoring agency and/or a sector\\-specific information sharing and analysis center.**\n\n\n\n For more information on incident response and remediation, see:\n \n\n\n* Joint advisory\n [Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-245a \"Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity\") \n\n .\n \n This advisory provides incident response best practices.\n* CISA\u2019s\n [Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/federal-government-cybersecurity-incident-and-vulnerability-response-playbooks \"Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks\") \n .

The authoring agencies recommend that software manufactures incorporate secure by design and default principles and tactics into their software development practices to strengthen the security posture for their customers.\n \n\n\n\n For information on secure by design practices that may protect customers against common Volt Typhoon techniques, see joint guide\n [Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques \"Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques\") \n and joint Secure by Design Alert\n [Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-security-design-improvements-soho-device-manufacturers \"Secure by Design Alert: Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n For more information on secure by design, see CISA\u2019s\n [Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign \"Secure by Design\") \n webpage and\n [joint guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design \"Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\") \n .\n \n\n\n\n The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization\u2019s cybersecurity posture on the basis of Volt Typhoon activity. These mitigations align with the Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019s\n [Cross\\-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals \"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals\") \n for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n \n\n\n#### **IT Network Administrators and Defenders**\n\n\n##### ***Harden the Attack Surface***\n\n\n* **Apply patches for internet\\-facing systems within a risk\\-informed span of time** \n \\[\n [CPG 1E](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ].

An organization\u2019s primary attack surface is the combination of the exposure of all its internet\\-facing systems. Decrease the attack surface by not exposing systems or management interfaces to the internet when not necessary.\n* **Plan \u201cend of life\u201d for technology beyond manufacturer supported lifecycle** \n . Inventories of organizational assets should be leveraged in patch and configuration management as noted above. Inventories will also enable identification of technology beyond the manufacturer\u2019s supported lifecycle. Where technology is beyond \u201cend of life\u201d or \u201cend of support,\u201d additional cybersecurity vigilance is necessary, and may warrant one or more of the following:\n\t+ Supplemental support agreements;\n\t+ Additional scanning and testing;\n\t+ Configuration changes;\n\t+ Isolation;\n\t+ Segmentation; and\n\t+ Development of forward\\-looking plans to facilitate replacement.\n\n\n##### ***Secure Credentials***\n\n\n* **Do not store credentials on edge appliances/devices.** \n Ensure edge devices do not contain accounts that could provide domain admin access.\n* **Do not store plaintext credentials on any system** \n \\[\n [CPG 2L](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureSensitiveData2L \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ].

Implement continuous monitoring for changes in group membership, especially in privileged groups, to detect and respond to unauthorized modifications.\n\t+ **Remove accounts from high\\-privilege groups like Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins** \n\t . Temporarily reinstate these privileges only when necessary and under strict auditing to reduce the risk of privilege abuse.\n\t+ **Transition to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)** \n\t where suitable for enhanced management and security of service account credentials. gMSAs provide automated password management and simplified Service Principal Name (SPN) management, enhancing security over traditional service accounts.

This practice can reduce lateral movement exposure within networks.\n* **Conduct comprehensive trust assessments to identify business\\-critical trusts and apply necessary controls** \n to prevent unauthorized cross\\-forest/domain traversal.\n* **Harden federated authentication by enabling Secure Identifier (SID) Filtering and Selective Authentication on AD trust relationships** \n to further restrict unauthorized access across domain boundaries.\n* **Implement network segmentation to isolate federation servers** \n from other systems and limit allowed traffic to systems and protocols that require access in accordance with Zero Trust principles.\n\n\n##### ***Secure Cloud Assets***\n\n\n* **Harden cloud assets** \n in accordance with vendor\\-provided or industry standard hardening guidance.\n\t+ Organizations with Microsoft cloud infrastructure, see CISA\u2019s\n\t [Microsoft 365 Security Configuration Baseline Guides](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20%26%20Google%20Workspace%20Baselines \"Microsoft 365 & Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baselines\") \n\t , which provide minimum viable secure configuration baselines for Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Azure Active Directory (now known as Microsoft Entra ID), Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, Power BI, Power Platform, SharePoint Online, and Teams. For additional guidance, see the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s\n\t [Blueprint for Secure Cloud](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/ \"ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud\") \n\t .\n\t+ Organizations with Google cloud infrastructure, see CISA\u2019s\n\t [Google Workspace Security Configuration Baseline Guides](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20%26%20Google%20Workspace%20Baselines \"Microsoft 365 & Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baselines\") \n\t , which provide minimum viable secure configuration baselines for Groups for Business, GMAIL, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Common Controls, Google Classroom, Google Drive and Docs, Google Meet, and Google Sites.\n* **Revoke unnecessary public access to cloud environment.** \n This involves reviewing and restricting public endpoints and ensuring that services like storage accounts, databases, and virtual machines are not publicly accessible unless absolutely necessary. Disable legacy authentication protocols across all cloud services and platforms. Legacy protocols frequently lack support for advanced security mechanisms such as multifactor authentication, rendering them susceptible to compromises. Instead, enforce the use of modern authentication protocols that support stronger security features like MFA, token\\-based authentication, and adaptive authentication measures.\n\t+ **Enforce this practice through the use of Conditional Access Policies** \n\t . These policies can initially be run in report\\-only mode to identify potential impacts and plan mitigations before fully enforcing them. This approach allows organizations to systematically control access to their cloud resources, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compromise.\n* **Regularly monitor and audit privileged cloud\\-based accounts** \n , including service accounts, which are frequently abused to enable broad cloud resource access and persistence.\n\n\n##### ***Be Prepared***\n\n\n* **Ensure logging is turned on for application, access, and security logs** \n (e.g., intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems, firewall, data loss prevention, and VPNs) \\[\n [CPG 2T](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ]. Given Volt Typhoon\u2019s use of LOTL techniques and their significant dwell time, application event logs may be a valuable resource to hunt for Volt Typhoon activity because these logs typically remain on endpoints for relatively long periods of time.\n\t+ For OT assets where logs are non\\-standard or not available,\n\t **collect network traffic and communications between those assets and other assets** \n\t .\n\t+ Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized changes.\n* **Store logs in a central system** \n , such as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or central database.\n\t+ **Ensure the logs can only be accessed or modified by authorized and authenticated users** \n\t \\[\n\t [CPG 2U](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureLogStorage2U \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n\t ].\n\t+ **Store logs for a period informed by risk or pertinent regulatory guidelines** \n\t .\n\t+ **Tune log alerting to reduce noise while ensuring there are alerts for high\\-risk activities** \n\t .

This way, network defenders can identify potential outliers, which may indicate malicious activity.\n **Note:** \n For information on establishing a baseline, see joint guide\n [Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques \"Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques\") \n .\n* **Document a list of threats and cyber actor TTPs relevant to your organization** \n (e.g., based on industry or sectors), and maintain the ability (such as via rules, alerting, or commercial prevention and detection systems) to detect instances of those key threats \\[\n [CPG 3A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ].\n* **Implement periodic training for all employees and contractors that covers basic security concepts** \n (such as phishing, business email compromise, basic operational security, password security, etc.), as well as fostering an internal culture of security and cyber awareness \\[\n [CPG 2I](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#BasicCybersecurityTraining2I \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ].\n\t+ **Tailor the training to network IT personnel/administrators and other key staff based on relevant organizational cyber threats and TTPs** \n\t , such as Volt Typhoon. For example, communicate that Volt Typhoon actors are known to target personal email accounts of IT staff, and encourage staff to protect their personal email accounts by using strong passwords and implementing MFA.\n\t+ In addition to basic cybersecurity training,\n\t **ensure personnel who maintain or secure OT as part of their regular duties receive OT\\-specific cybersecurity training** \n\t on at least an annual basis \\[\n\t [CPG 2J](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#OTCybersecurityTraining2J \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n\t ].\n\t+ **Educate users about the risks associated with storing unprotected passwords** \n\t .\n\n\n#### **OT Administrators and Defenders**\n\n\n* **Change default passwords** \n \\[\n [CPG 2A](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#ChangingDefaultPasswords2A \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ] and ensure they meet the policy requirements for complexity. If the asset\u2019s password cannot be changed, implement compensating controls for the device; for example, segment the device into separate enclaves and implement increased monitoring and logging.\n* **Require that passwords for all OT password\\-protected assets be at least 15 characters** \n , when technically feasible. In instances where minimum passwords lengths are not technically feasible (for example, assets in remote locations), apply compensating controls, record the controls, and log all login attempts. \\[\n [CPG 2B](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MinimumPasswordStrength2B \"Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\") \n ].\n* **Enforce strict access policies for accessing OT networks** \n .
