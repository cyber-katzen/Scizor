Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT website.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nSTACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\n\nThe FTP server does not limit the length of a command parameter which may cause a buffer overflow condition.\nCVE-2018-7240 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n\nUSE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798\n\nThe FTP servers contain a hard-coded account, which could allow unauthorized access.\nCVE-2018-7241 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n\nUSE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327\n\nThe FTP server does not limit the length of a command parameter, which may cause a buffer overflow condition.\nCVE-2018-7242 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\nRESEARCHER\nNikita Maximov, Alexey Stennikov, and Kirill Chernyshov of Positive Technologies reported the vulnerabilities to Schneider Electric. Meng Leizi and Zhang Daoquan reported the vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector: Critical Manufacturing\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide\nCompany Headquarters Location: France\n",
