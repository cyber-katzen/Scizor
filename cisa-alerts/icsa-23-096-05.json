A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)** A vulnerability exists in the affected SDM600 versions application programmable interface (API) web services authorization validation implementation. An attacker successfully exploiting the vulnerability could read sensitive data directly from an insufficiently protected or restricted data store.[CVE\\-2022\\-3683](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3683)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).**3\\.2\\.3 [IMPROPER RESOURCE SHUTDOWN OR RELEASE CWE\\-404](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/404.html)** A vulnerability exists in an SDM600 endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running multiple parallel requests, causing the SDM600 web services to become busy, rendering the application unresponsive.[CVE\\-2022\\-3684](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3684)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.4 [IMPROPER PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT CWE\\-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)** A vulnerability exists in the affected SDM600 versions software. The software operates at a privilege level higher than the minimum level required. An attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability could escalate privileges.[CVE\\-2022\\-3685](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3685)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.5 [IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE\\-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)** A vulnerability exists in the affected SDM600 versions API permission check mechanism. Successful exploitation could cause an unauthenticated user to gain access to device data, causing confidentiality and integrity issues.[CVE\\-2022\\-3686](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-3686)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Switzerland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Hitachi Energy reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Hitachi Energy recommends applying the following mitigations:* All SDM600 versions prior to v1\\.2 FP3 HF4 (Build Nr. 1\\.2\\.23000\\.291\\): Update to v1\\.3\\.0\\.1339* SDM600 versions prior to v1\\.3\\.0 (Build Nr. 1\\.3\\.0\\.1339\\): Apply workaround detailed below. Hitachi Energy recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to help protect a process control network from attacks originating from outside the network:* Practice principles of least privileges to minimize permissions and accesses to SDM600 related resources.* Follow security practices defined in SDM600 security deployment guidelines.* Physically protect process control systems from unauthorized direct access.* Do not directly connect control systems networks to the internet.* Separate process control systems from other networks using a firewall system with a minimal number of open ports.* Process control systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving emails.* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses prior connection to a control system.
