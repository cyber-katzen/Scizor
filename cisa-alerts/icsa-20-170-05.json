EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.0\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Rockwell Automation\nEquipment: FactoryTalk View SE\nVulnerabilities: Improper Input Validation, Improper Restriction of Operations Within The Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote authenticated attacker to manipulate data of affected devices.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll versions of FactoryTalk View SE are affected.\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nThe affected product does not properly validate input of filenames within a project directory. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute a crafted file on a remote endpoint that may result in remote code execution (RCE).\u00a0\nCVE-2020-12029 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N).\u00a0\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119\nAfter bypassing memory corruption mechanisms found in the operating system, a local, authenticated attacker may corrupt the associated memory space allowing for arbitrary code execution.\nCVE-2020-12031 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264\nA remote, authenticated attacker may be able to utilize certain handlers to interact with the data on the remote endpoint since those handlers do not enforce appropriate permissions.\nCVE-2020-12028 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0EXPOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACTOR CWE-200\nThe affected product discloses the hostnames and file paths for certain files within the system. A remote, authenticated attacker may be able to leverage this information for reconnaissance efforts.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-12027 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Government Facilities, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nRockwell Automation working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4.
