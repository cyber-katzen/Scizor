This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed October 20, 2015.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nIniNet Solutions GmbH has produced a new version of eWebServer, Version 2.02 that mitigates the vulnerability. The new version can be obtained by contacting IniNet Solutions GmbH. IniNet Solutions GmbH\u2019s contact information is available at the following URL:\nhttp://spidercontrol.net/contact/?L=1.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSET OWNERS WITH AFFECTED BAUM\u00dcLLER PRODUCTS\n\nBaum\u00fcller has reported that the three affected products will be retired in December 2015, and no patches are planned for these products. Baum\u00fcller recommends that asset owners contact them to discuss intermediate response options.\nBaum\u00fcller\u2019s contact information is available at the following URL: http://www.baumuller.com/e_contacts_24h.htm.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSET OWNERS WITH AFFECTED BECKHOFF PRODUCTS\n\nAsset owners of an identified Beckhoff product should determine if a vulnerable version of eWebServer is in use. Asset owners using a vulnerable version of eWebServer should contact their supplier or IniNet Solutions GmbH to obtain a new version of eWebServer. Beckhoff has stated that IniNet Solutions GmbH products are not a Beckhoff product. eWebServer is an application software by a third-party vendor developed and sold independent of Beckhoff. Beckhoff asserts that their (standard) products are not affected.\nICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMaintain layered physical and logical security to implement defense-in-depth design practices for ICS environments.\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
