EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Schneider Electric\nEquipment: Floating License Manager\nVulnerabilities: Improper Input Validation, Memory Corruption\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nThese vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to deny the acquisition of a valid license for legal use of the product.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of Floating License Manager are affected:\n\nFloating License Manager Version 2.3.0.0 and earlier\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA denial of service vulnerability related to preemptive item deletion in lmadmin and vendor daemon components allows a remote attacker to send a combination of messages to lmadmin or the vendor daemon, causing the heartbeat between lmadmin and the vendor daemon to stop and the vendor daemon to shut down.\nCVE-2018-20031 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA denial of service vulnerability related to message decoding in lmadmin and vendor daemon components allows a remote attacker to send a combination of messages to lmadmin or the vendor daemon, causing the heartbeat between lmadmin and the vendor daemon to stop and the vendor daemon to shut down.\nCVE-2018-20032 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MEMORY CORRUPTION CWE-119\nA remote code execution vulnerability in lmadmin and vendor daemon components could allow a remote attacker to corrupt the memory by allocating/deallocating memory, loading lmadmin or the vendor daemon and causing the heartbeat between lmadmin and the vendor daemon to stop. This would force the vendor daemon to shut down. No exploit of this vulnerability has been demonstrated.\nCVE-2018-20033 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nA denial of service vulnerability related to adding an item to a list in lmadmin and vendor daemon components allows a remote attacker to send a combination of messages to lmadmin or the vendor daemon, causing the heartbeat between lmadmin and the vendor daemon to stop and the vendor daemon to shut down.\nCVE-2018-20034 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: France\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSchneider Electric reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSchneider Electric has made a fix for these vulnerabilities available for download on its website at the following location:\nSchneider Electric recommends users upgrade to Floating License Manager (FLM) Version 2.3.1.0 as soon as possible.\nDetails are described in the Schneider Electric Security Notification SEVD-2019-134-04.\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
