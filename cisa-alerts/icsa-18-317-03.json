EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 4.3\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC Panels and SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal)\nVulnerability: Code Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with network access to the web server to perform a HTTP header injection attack.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nSiemens reports the vulnerability affects the following versions of SIMATIC Panel software and SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal):\n\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels 4\" - 22\": All versions prior to v14,\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels 7\" and 15\": All versions prior to v14,\nSIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 und KTP900F: All versions prior to v14,\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced: All versions prior to v14,\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: All versions prior to v14,\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal): All versions prior to v14, and\nSIMATIC HMI Classic Devices (TP/MP/OP/MP Mobile Panel): All versions.\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nThe integrated web server (Port 80/TCP and Port 443/TCP) of the affected devices could allow an attacker to inject HTTP headers.An attacker must trick a valid user who is authenticated to the device into clicking on a malicious link to exploit the vulnerability.\nCVE-2018-13814 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Chemical, Energy, Food and Agriculture, and Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has provided updates for the following products to fix the vulnerability. The update can be located here:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109755826\n\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels 4\" - 22\": Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15 Update 4 or newer, and then update panel to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels 7\" & 15\": Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15 Update 4 or newer, and then update panel to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 und KTP900F: Update SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) to v15 Update 4 or newer, and then update panel to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced: Update to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional: Update to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal): Update to v15 Update 4 or newer.\nSIMATIC HMI Classic Devices (TP/MP/OP/MP Mobile Panel): Restrict network access to the integrated web server and deactivate the web server if not required. The web server is disabled by default.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-944083 on their website:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
