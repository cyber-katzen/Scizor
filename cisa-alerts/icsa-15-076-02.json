[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHoneywell XL Web Controller Directory Traversal Vulnerability============================================================= Last Revised August 27, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-15\\-076\\-02OVERVIEW-------- Martin Jartelius of Outpost24 has identified a directory traversal vulnerability in Honeywell\u2019s XL Web Controller. Honeywell has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following XLWeb controller versions are affected:* XL1000C50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 52 I/O,* XL1000C100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 104 I/O,* XL1000C500\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 300 I/O,* XL1000C1000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 600 I/O,* XL1000C50U\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 52 I/O UUKL,* XL1000C100U\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 104 I/O UUKL,* XL1000C500U\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 300 I/O UUKL, and* XL1000C1000U\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EXCEL WEB 600 I/O UUKL.IMPACT------ An attacker may use this vulnerability to generate a valid login for an administrative user on the Honeywell XLWeb controller giving the attacker full administrator access to the system. The XLWEB application effectively becomes an entry point into the network where it is located. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Honeywell is a US\\-based company that maintains offices worldwide. The affected products, XLWeb controllers, are web\\-based SCADA systems. According to Honeywell, XLWeb controllers are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Honeywell estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe and the Middle East.VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW### PATH TRAVERSALCWE\\-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22\\.html, web site last accessed March 17, 2015\\.

Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\\-CERT web page at **:** [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the ICS\\-CERT web site ( [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/](/ics/)  ).
