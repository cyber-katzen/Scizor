EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION**  : Low attack complexity* **Vendor**  : Ashlar\\-Vellum* **Equipment**  : Cobalt, Graphite, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share* **Vulnerabilities**  : Out\\-of\\-Bounds Write, Heap\\-based Buffer Overflow, Out\\-of\\-Bounds Read2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Ashlar\\-Vellum products are affected:* Cobalt: v12 SP0 Build (1204\\.77\\) and prior* Graphite: v13\\.0\\.48 and prior* Xenon: v12 SP0 Build (1204\\.77\\) and prior* Argon: v12 SP0 Build (1204\\.77\\) and prior* Lithium: v12 SP0 Build (1204\\.77\\) and prior### 3\\.2 Vulnerability Overview**3\\.2\\.1 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS WRITE CWE\\-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)** In Ashlar\\-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share v12 SP0 Build (1204\\.77\\), the affected applications lack proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing XE files. This could lead to an out\\-of\\-bounds write. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-39427](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39427)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).**3\\.2\\.2 [OUT\\-OF\\-BOUNDS READ CWE\\-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)** In Ashlar\\-Vellum Graphite v13\\.0\\.48, the affected application lacks proper validation of user\\-supplied data when parsing VC6 files. This could lead to an out\\-of\\-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.[CVE\\-2023\\-39936](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39936)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Ashlar\\-Vellum recommends users apply the following mitigations to help reduce risk:* Install the latest version of [Graphite](https://download.ashlar.com/v13/gr.html)* Cobalt, Xenon, Lithium, and Argon share update [v12](https://download.ashlar.com/v12/)  Build (1204\\.78\\).* Only open files from trusted sources. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.5\\.
