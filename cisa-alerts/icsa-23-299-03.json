EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Ashlar-Vellum\nEquipment: Cobalt, Graphite, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share\nVulnerabilities: Out-of-Bounds Write, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-Bounds Read\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Ashlar-Vellum products are affected:\n\nCobalt: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior\nGraphite: v13.0.48 and prior\nXenon: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior\nArgon: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior\nLithium: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nIn Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share v12 SP0 Build (1204.77), the affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XE files. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-39427\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nIn Ashlar-Vellum Graphite v13.0.48, the affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing VC6 files. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\nCVE-2023-39936\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAshlar-Vellum recommends users apply the following mitigations to help reduce risk:\n\nInstall the latest version of\u00a0Graphite\nCobalt, Xenon, Lithium, and Argon share update\u00a0v12\u00a0Build (1204.78).\nOnly open files from trusted sources.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to\u00a0Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams\u00a0for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to\u00a0Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks\u00a0for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nOctober 26, 2023: Initial Publication\n\n",
