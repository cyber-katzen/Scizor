MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has released an update for the following versions:\n\nJT Utilities, All versions prior to v13.1.1.0: Update to v13.1.1.0 or later versions\nJTTK, All versions prior to v11.1.1.0: Update to v11.1.1.0 or later versions\n\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nAvoid to open untrusted files from unknown sources using JTTK.\nAvoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources in JT Utilities.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for Industrial Security and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\nFor more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-802578\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact Siemens ProductCERT.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of t these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
