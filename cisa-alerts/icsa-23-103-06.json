It is recommended that operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place to minimize the risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability. \u00a0\nSiemens recommends that operators: \u00a0\n\nApply provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. \u00a0\nAutomatically apply security updates across multiple product instances if automation is supported by the product. \u00a0\nValidate any security update before being applied. It is recommended to perform the update process under the supervision of trained staff in the target environment. \u00a0\u00a0\nProtect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN) as a general security measure.\u00a0\n\nIn order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, it is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens\u00a0operational guidelines.\u00a0\nRecommended security guidelines can be found at\u00a0Siemens\u2019 grid security page.\u00a0\nFor more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-322980 in\u00a0HTML\u00a0and\u00a0CSAF.\u00a0\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with\u00a0Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. \u00a0\n",
