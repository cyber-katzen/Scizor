Contact a [Schneider Electric support team](https://www.apc.com/us/en/support/contact-us/)  for upgrades. For the products not listed above, Schneider Electric is in the process of establishing a remediation plan for affected NMC2 and NMC3 offers. This plan will include fixes or mitigations for these vulnerabilities. This document will be updated as remediations become available. Until then, users should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:* NMC users should not trust links provided from sources that have not been verified as authentic.* Ensure the workstation where the browser is being used is secured.* If a debug.tar file is generated via Web or CLI, ensure it is deleted after retrieval. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices.* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
