Against devices that support receiving non\\-SSP A\\-MSDU frames, which is mandatory as part of 802\\.11n, an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.[CVE\\-2020\\-24588](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-24588)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3\\.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE\\-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html) An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7\\.1\\. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi\\-Fi networks to launch denial\\-of\\-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.[CVE\\-2020\\-26139](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26139)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf)  and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA\\-913875](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-913875.pdf)  CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  .
