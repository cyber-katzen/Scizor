EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Honeywell\nEquipment: MAXPRO VMS & NVR\nVulnerabilities: Deserialization of Untrusted Data, SQL Injection\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in elevation of privileges, cause a denial-of-service condition, or allow unauthenticated remote code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of MAXPRO VMS and NVR, video management systems, are affected:\nMAXPRO VMS:\n\nHNMSWVMS prior to Version VMS560 Build 595 T2-Patch\nHNMSWVMSLT prior to Version VMS560 Build 595 T2-Patch\n\nMAXPRO NVR:\n\nMAXPRO NVR XE prior to Version NVR 5.6 Build 595 T2-Patch\nMAXPRO NVR SE prior to Version NVR 5.6 Build 595 T2-Patch\nMAXPRO NVR PE prior to Version NVR 5.6 Build 595 T2-Patch\nMPNVRSWXX prior to Version NVR 5.6 Build 595 T2-Patch\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nThe affected products are vulnerable to an unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker may be able to remotely modify deserialized data without authentication using a specially crafted web request, resulting in remote code execution.\nCVE-2020-6959 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND CWE-89\nA SQL injection vulnerability exists that could give an attacker remote unauthenticated access to the web user interface with administrator-level privileges.\nCVE-2020-6960 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nJoachim Kerschbaumer discovered these vulnerabilities; Honeywell reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nHoneywell recommends users update VMS 560 Build 595 T2-Patch for affected VMS systems, and NVR 5.6 Build 595 T2-Patch for affected NVR systems. The updates can be found at the Honeywell\u2019s MyWebTech site via a user account.\nAdditionally, Honeywell recommends that users:\n\nUpdate MAXPRO VMS and NVR to latest R560 and 5.6 before applying this patch.\nUpdate software patch as recommended in Honeywell security notification (SN 2019-10-25 01).\nAs a best practice, Honeywell recommends users isolate their systems from the Internet or create additional layers of defense by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ; and if remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
