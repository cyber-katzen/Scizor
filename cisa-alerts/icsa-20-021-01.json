EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 9\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit* **Vendor:**  Honeywell* **Equipment:**  MAXPRO VMS \\& NVR* **Vulnerabilities**  : Deserialization of Untrusted Data, SQL Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in elevation of privileges, cause a denial\\-of\\-service condition, or allow unauthenticated remote code execution.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of MAXPRO VMS and NVR, video management systems, are affected: MAXPRO VMS:* HNMSWVMS prior to Version VMS560 Build 595 T2\\-Patch* HNMSWVMSLT prior to Version VMS560 Build 595 T2\\-Patch MAXPRO NVR:* MAXPRO NVR XE prior to Version NVR 5\\.6 Build 595 T2\\-Patch* MAXPRO NVR SE prior to Version NVR 5\\.6 Build 595 T2\\-Patch* MAXPRO NVR PE prior to Version NVR 5\\.6 Build 595 T2\\-Patch* MPNVRSWXX prior to Version NVR 5\\.6 Build 595 T2\\-Patch### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE\\-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) The affected products are vulnerable to an unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker may be able to remotely modify deserialized data without authentication using a specially crafted web request, resulting in remote code execution.[CVE\\-2020\\-6959](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-6959)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND CWE\\-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) A SQL injection vulnerability exists that could give an attacker remote unauthenticated access to the web user interface with administrator\\-level privileges.[CVE\\-2020\\-6960](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-6960)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Joachim Kerschbaumer discovered these vulnerabilities; Honeywell reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Honeywell recommends users update VMS 560 Build 595 T2\\-Patch for affected VMS systems, and NVR 5\\.6 Build 595 T2\\-Patch for affected NVR systems. The updates can be found at the [Honeywell\u2019s MyWebTech site](:%20https:/mywebtech.honeywell.com/Home)  via a user account. Additionally, Honeywell recommends that users:* Update MAXPRO VMS and NVR to latest R560 and 5\\.6 before applying this patch.* Update software patch as recommended in Honeywell security notification [(SN 2019\\-10\\-25 01\\)](https://www.security.honeywell.com/resources/eol-and-security-notices)  .* As a best practice, Honeywell recommends users isolate their systems from the Internet or create additional layers of defense by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ; and if remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
