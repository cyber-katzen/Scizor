EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 5.2\nATTENTION: Public exploits are available, low attack complexity\nVendor: AliveCor\nEquipment: KardiaMobile\nVulnerabilities: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-immutable Data, Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to attackers stealing or faking personal cardiograms or enabling a denial-of-service attack. Attackers must be at close range to carry out these attacks.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of KardiaMobile, a smartphone-based personal electrocardiogram (EKG) device, are affected:\n\nKardia App Android application Version 5.17.1-754993421 and prior (affected only by CVE-2022-40703)\nKardiaMobile IoT device, all versions (affected only by CVE-2022-41627)\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY ASSUMED-IMMUTABLE DATA CWE-302\nThe smartphone application for the affected product is vulnerable to the publicly known \u201cIntent Manipulation\u201d exploit on Android phones. This exploit allows attackers to bypass app authentication and view or alter information in the app.\nCVE-2022-40703 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311\nThe physical IoT device of the affected product has no encryption for its data-over-sound protocols. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read patient electrocardiography (EKG) results or create a denial-of-service condition by emitting sounds at similar frequencies as the device, disrupting the smartphone microphone\u2019s ability to accurately read the data. To carry out this attack, the attacker must be close (less than 5 feet) to pick up and emit sound waves.\nCVE-2022-41627 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: North America and Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCarlos Cilleruelo Rodr\u00edguez and Javier Junquera S\u00e1nchez of the University of Alcal\u00e1 reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nThe Kardia App usage instructions include recommendations for users to use passcode (PIN) or biometric identification for their smartphone devices; such measures greatly reduce the risk of Intent Manipulation.\nAliveCor has acknowledged that the data-over-sound protocol has no encryption and is vulnerable to CVE-2022-41627, but the circumstances necessary for exploitation are \u201cunlikely.\u201d\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nThese vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
