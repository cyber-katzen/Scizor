See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have observed continued targeting through spearphishing campaigns using TrickBot malware\u00a0in North America. A sophisticated group of cybercrime actors is luring victims, via phishing emails, with a traffic infringement phishing scheme to download TrickBot.\nTrickBot\u2014first identified in 2016\u2014is a Trojan developed and operated by a sophisticated group of cybercrime actors. Originally designed as a banking Trojan to steal financial data, TrickBot has evolved into highly modular, multi-stage malware that provides its operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities.\nTo secure against TrickBot, CISA and FBI recommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, which include blocking suspicious Internet Protocol addresses, using antivirus software, and providing social engineering and phishing training to employees.\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nTrickBot is an advanced Trojan that malicious actors spread primarily by spearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments or links, which\u2014if enabled\u2014execute malware (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001], Phishing: Spearphishing Link [T1566.002]). CISA and FBI are aware of recent attacks that use phishing emails, claiming to contain proof of a traffic violation, to steal sensitive information. The phishing emails contain links that redirect to a website hosted on a compromised server that prompts the victim to click on photo proof of their traffic violation. (User Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001], User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]). In clicking the photo, the victim unknowingly downloads a malicious JavaScript file that, when opened, automatically communicates with the malicious actor\u2019s command and control (C2) server to download TrickBot to the victim\u2019s system (Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript [T1059.007]).\nAttackers can use TrickBot to:\n\nDrop other malware, such as Ryuk and Conti ransomware, or\nServe as an Emotet downloader (Ingress Tool Transfer [T1105]).[1]\n\nTrickBot uses person-in-the-browser attacks to steal information, such as login credentials (Man in the Browser [T1185]). Additionally, some of TrickBot\u2019s modules spread the malware laterally across a network by abusing the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. TrickBot operators have a toolset capable of spanning the entirety of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, from actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting (Reconnaissance [TA0043]), to trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data (Impact [TA0040]).\nTrickBot is capable of data exfiltration over a hardcoded C2 server, cryptomining, and host enumeration (e.g., reconnaissance of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or Basic Input/Output System [UEFI/BIOS] firmware) (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041], Resource Hijacking [T1496], System Information Discovery.[2] For host enumeration, operators deliver TrickBot in modules containing a configuration file with specific tasks.\nFigure 1 lays out TrickBot\u2019s use of enterprise techniques.\n\nFigure 1: MITRE ATT&CK enterprise techniques used by TrickBot \n\u00a0\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques\nAccording to MITRE, TrickBot [S0266] uses the ATT&CK techniques listed in table 1.\nTable 1: TrickBot ATT&CK techniques for enterprise\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\n\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing Attachment\nT1566.001\nTrickBot has used an email with an Excel sheet containing a malicious macro to deploy the malware.\n\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing Link\nT1566.002\n\nTrickBot has been delivered via malicious links in phishing emails.\n\n\n\n\nExecution [TA0002]\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\nT1053.005\nTrickBot creates a scheduled task on the system that provides persistence.\n\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\nT1059.003\nTrickBot has used macros in Excel documents to download and deploy the malware on the user\u2019s machine.\n\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript/JScript\nT1059.007\nTrickBot victims unknowingly download a malicious JavaScript file that, when opened, automatically communicates with the malicious actor\u2019s C2 server to download TrickBot to the victim\u2019s system.\n\n\nNative API\nT1106\nTrickBot uses the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) call, CreateProcessW(), to manage execution flow.\n\n\nUser Execution: Malicious Link\nT1204.001\nTrickBot has sent spearphishing emails in an attempt to lure users to click on a malicious link.\n\n\nUser Execution: Malicious File\nT1204.002\nTrickBot has attempted to get users to launch malicious documents to deliver its payload.\n\n\n\nPersistence [TA0003]\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\nT1053.005\nTrickBot creates a scheduled task on the system that provides persistence.\n\n\nCreate or Modify System Process: Windows Service\nT1543.003\nTrickBot establishes persistence by creating an autostart service that allows it to run whenever the machine boots.\n\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation [TA0004]\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\nT1053.005\nTrickBot creates a scheduled task on the system that provides persistence.\n\n\nProcess Injection: Process Hollowing\nT1055.012\nTrickBot injects into the svchost.exe process.\n\n\nCreate or Modify System Process: Windows Service\nT1543.003\nTrickBot establishes persistence by creating an autostart service that allows it to run whenever the machine boots.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Defense Evasion [TA0005]\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nObfuscated Files or Information\nT1027\nTrickBot uses non-descriptive names to hide functionality and uses an AES CBC (256 bits) encryption algorithm for its loader and configuration files.\n\n\nObfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\nT1027.002\nTrickBot leverages a custom packer to obfuscate its functionality.\n\n\nMasquerading\nT1036\nThe TrickBot downloader has used an icon to appear as a Microsoft Word document.\n\n\nProcess Injection: Process Hollowing\nT1055.012\nTrickBot injects into the svchost.exe process.\n\n\nModify Registry\nT1112\nTrickBot can modify registry entries.\n\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information \nT1140\nTrickBot decodes the configuration data and modules.\n\n\nSubvert Trust Controls: Code Signing\nT1553.002\nTrickBot has come with a signed downloader component.\n\n\nImpair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\nT1562.001\nTrickBot can disable Windows Defender.\n\n\n\nCredential Access [TA0006]\n\n\n\nTechnique Title\nID\nUse\n\n\n\n\nInput Capture: Credential API Hooking\nT1056.004\nTrickBot has the ability to capture Remote Desktop Protocol credentials by capturing the CredEnumerateA API.\n\n\nUnsecured Credentials: Credentials in Files\nT1552.001\nTrickBot can obtain passwords stored in files from several applications such as Outlook, Filezilla, OpenSSH, OpenVPN and WinSCP.

System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes prior to implementation to avoid negative impacts.\n\nProvide social engineering and phishing training to employees.\nConsider drafting or updating a policy addressing suspicious emails\u00a0 that specifies users must report all suspicious emails to the security and/or IT departments.\nMark external emails with a banner denoting the email is from an external source to assist users in detecting spoofed emails.\nImplement Group Policy Object and firewall rules.\nImplement an antivirus program and a formalized patch management process.\nImplement filters at the email gateway and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall.\nAdhere to the principle of least privilege.\nImplement a Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance validation system.\nSegment and segregate networks and functions.\nLimit unnecessary lateral communications between network hoses, segments, and devices.\nConsider using application allowlisting technology on all assets to ensure that only authorized software executes, and all unauthorized software is blocked from executing on assets. Ensure that such technology only allows authorized, digitally signed scripts to run on a system.\nEnforce multi-factor authentication.\nEnable a firewall on agency workstations configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nImplement an Intrusion Detection System, if not already used, to detect C2 activity and other potentially malicious network activity\nMonitor web traffic. Restrict user access to suspicious or risky sites.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate access control lists.\nDisable the use of SMBv1 across the network and require at least SMBv2 to harden systems against network propagation modules used by TrickBot.\nVisit the MITRE ATT&CK Techniques pages (linked in table 1 above) for additional mitigation and detection strategies.\nSee CISA\u2019s Alert on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more information on addressing potential incidents and applying best practice incident response procedures.\n\nFor additional information on malware incident prevention and handling, see the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops.\nResources\n\nCISA Fact Sheet: TrickBot Malware\nMS-ISAC White Paper: Security Primer \u2013 TrickBot\nUnited Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre Advisory: Ryuk Ransomware Targeting Organisations Globally\nCISA and MS-ISAC Joint Alert AA20-280A: Emotet Malware\nMITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] FireEye Blog - A Nasty Trick: From Credential Theft Malware to Business Disruption\n[2] Eclypsium Blog - TrickBot Now Offers 'TrickBoot': Persist, Brick, Profit\n\nRevisions\n\nMarch 17, 2021: Initial Version|March 24, 2021: Added MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1592.003 used for reconnaissance|May 20, 2021: Added new MITRE ATT&CKs and updated Table 1\n",
