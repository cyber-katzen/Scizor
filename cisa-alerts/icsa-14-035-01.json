Siemens has produced updates that mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Siemens product is affected:\n\nSIMATIC WinCC OA all versions prior to 3.12 P002\u00a0\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in attackers escalating their privileges, performing remote code execution, traversing through file systems, or causing a denial of service.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\u00a0\nBACKGROUND\nSiemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\nThe affected product, SIMATIC WinCC OA, is a client-server human-machine interface (HMI) system. According to Siemens, SIMATIC WinCC OA is deployed across several sectors including food and beverage, water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nIMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE (\u201cCODE INJECTION\u201d)CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (\u201cCode Injection\u201d), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html, Web site last accessed February 4, 2014.\n\nThe SIMATIC WinCC OA integrated Web server at Port 4999/TCP might allow attackers to perform remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets without authentication.\nCVE-2014-1697NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1697, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, Web site last visited February 4, 2014.\n\nRELATIVE PATH TRAVERSALCWE-23: Relative Path Traversal, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html, Web site last accessed February 4, 2014.\n\nThe SIMATIC WinCC OA integrated Web server at Port 4999/TCP might allow attackers to traverse through the server\u2019s file system based on the application\u2019s Windows user permissions by sending specially crafted packets over the network without authentication.\nCVE-2014-1698NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1698, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, Web site last visited February 4, 2014.\n\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed February 4, 2014.\n\nThe SIMATIC WinCC OA integrated Web server at Port 4999/TCP might allow attackers to perform a denial of service attack on the SIMATIC WinCC OA monitoring service by sending malformed HTTP requests over the network without authentication. Restarting the WinCC OA Console recovers the monitoring service.\nCVE-2014-1699NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1699, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, Web site last visited February 4, 2014.\n\nUSE OF PASSWORD HASH WITH INSUFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL EFFORTCWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html, Web site last accessed February 4, 2014.\n\nThe SIMATIC WinCC OA server application has a weak hashing algorithm for project users\u2019 credentials. By brute force, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the affected WinCC OA server application.\nCVE-2014-1696NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1696, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, Web site last visited February 4, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\u00a0\nEXISITENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\u00a0\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low to moderate skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nSiemens recommends updating to SIMATIC WinCC OA v3.12 and to install patch P002 January.\nSIMATIC WiNCC OA v3.12 can be obtained here (login and password required):\nSIMATIC WiNCC OA v3.12\nThe patch SIMATIC WinCC OA v3.12 P002 January can be obtained here (login and password required):\nSIMATIC WinCC OA v3.12 P002 January\nSiemens security advisory is located here:\nSiemens security advisory SSA-342587\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC/ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS-CERT Web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC/ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
