Siemens has produced updates that mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n \n\n\n\n These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\n \n\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\n-----------------\n\n\n\n The following Siemens product is affected:\n \n\n\n* SIMATIC WinCC OA all versions prior to 3\\.12 P002\n\n\nIMPACT\n------\n\n\n\n Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in attackers escalating their privileges, performing remote code execution, traversing through file systems, or causing a denial of service.\n \n\n\n\n Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\n \n\n\n\n The affected product, SIMATIC WinCC OA, is a client\\-server human\\-machine interface (HMI) system. According to Siemens, SIMATIC WinCC OA is deployed across several sectors including food and beverage, water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical. Siemens estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n#### IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE (\u201cCODE INJECTION\u201d)CWE\\-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (\u201cCode Injection\u201d), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94\\.html, Web site last accessed February 4, 2014\\.\n\n\n\n\n The SIMATIC WinCC OA integrated Web server at Port 4999/TCP might allow attackers to perform remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets without authentication.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2014\\-1697NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2014\\-1697, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report.
