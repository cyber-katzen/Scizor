EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCVSS v3 9.8\n\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.\nVendor: Nari\nEquipment: PCS-9611\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-18-025-01 Nari PCS-9611 that was published January 25, 2018, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT website.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker arbitrary read/write abilities on the system.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nAll versions of the PCS-9611 relay, a control and monitoring unit, are affected.\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn improper input validation vulnerability has been identified that affects a service within the software that may allow a remote attacker to arbitrarily read/access system resources and affect the availability of the system.\nCVE-2018-5447 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCritical Infrastructure Sectors: Energy\nCountries/Areas Deployed: Asia\nCompany Headquarters Location: China\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nKirill Nesterov and Alexey Osipov from Kaspersky Labs reported the vulnerability to NCCIC.\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nNari has released Version 3.14 of the software to resolve the reported vulnerability. To obtain the newest version of the software, contact Nari by locating a local service contact via http://www.nrec.com/en/contact-us.html or contacting the company\u2019s headquarters directly at:\nTel: +86 25 8717 8888\nFax: +86 25 8717 8999\nEmail: NRservices@nrec.com or NRsales@nrec.com\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 --------\nNCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nNCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
