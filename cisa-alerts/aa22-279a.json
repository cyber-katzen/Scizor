PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.\nThis joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Defense Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends and persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.\nFor more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA\u2019s China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, FBI\u2019s Industry Alerts, and NSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance.\u00a0\nDownload the PDF version of this report: pdf, 409 KB\n\nTechnical Details\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI continue to assess PRC state-sponsored cyber activities as being one of the largest and most dynamic threats to U.S. government and civilian networks. PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical infrastructure networks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques\u2014some of which pose a significant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations (including telecommunications providers), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizations, and other critical infrastructure organizations.\nPRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use publicly available tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC state-sponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.

A malicious actor who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations \n\nApply patches provided by vendor and perform required system updates. \n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods \n\nSee vendor\u2019s Guidance For Preventing, Detecting, and Hunting for Exploitation of the Log4j 2 Vulnerability. \n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions \nThere are numerous vulnerable technologies and versions associated with CVE-2021-44228.

A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations \n\nIn affected versions of Apache APISIX, you can avoid this risk by explicitly commenting out batch-requests in the conf/config.yaml and conf/config-default.yaml files and restarting Apache APISIX.\n\n\nUpdate to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods \nN/A\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions \nApache APISIX between 1.3 and 2.12.1 (excluding 2.12.1)\nLTS versions of Apache APISIX between 2.10.0 and 2.10.4 \n\n\n\n\nTable XVII: ZOHO CVE-2021-40539\n\n\n\n\nZOHO CVE-2021-40539 CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical)\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Description \nZoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus version 6113 and prior is vulnerable to REST API authentication bypass with resultant remote code execution.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations \n\nUpgrade to latest version. \n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods \n\nRun ManageEngine\u2019s detection tool.\nCheck for specific files and logs.\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions \nZoho Corp ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus\n\n\n\n\nTable XVIII: Microsoft CVE-2021-26857\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2021-26857 CVSS 3.0: 7.8 (High)\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Description \nMicrosoft Exchange Server remote code execution vulnerability.

It is awaiting reanalysis, which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A malicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied,\" these requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see CVE-2021-42013).\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations \n\nApply update or patch.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods \n\nCommercially available scanners can detect CVE. \n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions \nApache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50\nFedoraproject Fedora 34 and 35\nOracle Instantis Enterprise Track 17.1-17.3\nNetapp Cloud Backup\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisions\n\nInitial Publication: October 6, 2022\n",
