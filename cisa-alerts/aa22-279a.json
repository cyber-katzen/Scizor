[Cybersecurity Advisory](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?f%5B0%5D=advisory_type%3A94) Cybersecurity AdvisoryTop CVEs Actively Exploited By People\u2019s Republic of China State\\-Sponsored Cyber Actors======================================================================================= Last Revised October 06, 2022 Alert Code AA22\\-279A### Summary This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) state\\-sponsored cyber actors as assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks. This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Defense Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends and persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). NSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from PRC state\\-sponsored malicious cyber actors. For more information on PRC state\\-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA\u2019s [China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/china)  , FBI\u2019s [Industry Alerts](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts)  , and NSA\u2019s [Cybersecurity Advisories \\& Guidance](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Cybersecurity-Advisories-Guidance/)  .

PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical infrastructure networks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques\u2014some of which pose a significant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations (including telecommunications providers), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizations, and other critical infrastructure organizations. PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use publicly available tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks. See Table 1 for the top used CVEs.*Table I: Top CVEs most used by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors since 2020* | Vendor | CVE | Vulnerability Type || --- | --- | --- || Apache Log4j | CVE\\-2021\\-44228 | Remote Code Execution || Pulse Connect Secure | CVE\\-2019\\-11510 | Arbitrary File Read || GitLab CE/EE | CVE\\-2021\\-22205 | Remote Code Execution || Atlassian | CVE\\-2022\\-26134 | Remote Code Execution || Microsoft Exchange | CVE\\-2021\\-26855 | Remote Code Execution || F5 Big\\-IP | CVE\\-2020\\-5902 | Remote Code Execution || VMware vCenter Server | CVE\\-2021\\-22005 | Arbitrary File Upload || Citrix ADC | CVE\\-2019\\-19781 | Path Traversal || Cisco Hyperflex | CVE\\-2021\\-1497 | Command Line Execution || Buffalo WSR | CVE\\-2021\\-20090 | Relative Path Traversal || Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center | CVE\\-2021\\-26084 | Remote Code Execution || Hikvision Webserver | CVE\\-2021\\-36260 | Command Injection || Sitecore XP | CVE\\-2021\\-42237 | Remote Code Execution || F5 Big\\-IP | CVE\\-2022\\-1388 | Remote Code Execution || Apache | CVE\\-2022\\-24112 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing || ZOHO | CVE\\-2021\\-40539 | Remote Code Execution || Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-26857 | Remote Code Execution || Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-26858 | Remote Code Execution || Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-27065 | Remote Code Execution || Apache HTTP Server | CVE\\-2021\\-41773 | Path Traversal | These state\\-sponsored actors continue to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to obfuscate their activities and target web\\-facing applications to establish initial access. Many of the CVEs indicated in Table 1 allow the actors to surreptitiously gain unauthorized access into sensitive networks, after which they seek to establish persistence and move laterally to other internally connected networks.

Prioritize patching vulnerabilities identified in this CSA and other [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)  .* Utilize phishing\\-resistant multi\\-factor authentication whenever possible. Require all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords, and change passwords immediately if there are indications that a password may have been compromised.* Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge.* Upgrade or replace end\\-of\\-life devices.* Move toward the Zero Trust security model.* Enable robust logging of Internet\\-facing systems and monitor the logs for anomalous activity.Appendix A----------*Table II: Apache CVE\\-2021\\-44228* | Apache CVE\\-2021\\-44228 CVSS 3\\.0: 10 (Critical) || --- || Vulnerability Description      Apache Log4j2 2\\.0\\-beta9 through 2\\.15\\.0 (excluding security releases 2\\.12\\.2, 2\\.12\\.3, and 2\\.3\\.1\\) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against malicious actor controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

It is awaiting reanalysis, which may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2\\.4\\.49\\. A malicious actor could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias\\-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied,\" these requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2\\.4\\.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2\\.4\\.50 is incomplete (see CVE\\-2021\\-42013\\). || Recommended Mitigations   * Apply update or patch. || Detection Methods   * Commercially available scanners can detect CVE. || Vulnerable Technologies and Versions      Apache HTTP Server 2\\.4\\.49 and 2\\.4\\.50     Fedoraproject Fedora 34 and 35     Oracle Instantis Enterprise Track 17\\.1\\-17\\.3     Netapp Cloud Backup |### Revisions Initial Publication: October 6, 2022 This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification \"Follow link\")  and this [Privacy \\& Use](/privacy-policy \"Follow link\")  policy.-------------------------- [product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-279a)  ; Related Advisories------------------ Jul 11, 2024 Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-193A### [CISA Red Team\u2019s Operations Against a Federal Civilian Executive Branch Organization Highlights the Necessity of Defense\\-in\\-Depth](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-193a) Jul 08, 2024 Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-190A### [People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Ministry of State Security APT40 Tradecraft in Action](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-190a) May 10, 2024 Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-131A### [\\#StopRansomware: Black Basta](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-131a) Apr 18, 2024 Cybersecurity Advisory \\| AA24\\-109A### [\\#StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware](/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-109a)* [Resources \\& Tools](/resources-tools)* [News \\& Events](/news-events)[Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency](/ \"Go to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency homepage\")[1\\-844\\-Say\\-CISA](tel:1-844-Say-CISA) * [Equal Opportunity \\& Accessibility](/oedia \"Equal Opportunity & Accessibility\")",
