PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.\n \n\n\n\n This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Defense Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends and persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n \n\n\n\n NSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section and Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from PRC state\\-sponsored malicious cyber actors.\n \n\n\n\n For more information on PRC state\\-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA\u2019s\n [China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/china) \n , FBI\u2019s\n [Industry Alerts](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts) \n , and NSA\u2019s\n [Cybersecurity Advisories \\& Guidance](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Cybersecurity-Advisories-Guidance/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Download the PDF version of this report:\n [pdf, 409 KB](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/06/2003092365/-1/-1/0/Joint_CSA_Top_CVEs_Exploited_by_PRC_cyber_actors_.PDF) \n\n\n\n\n### Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n NSA, CISA, and FBI continue to assess PRC state\\-sponsored cyber activities as being one of the largest and most dynamic threats to U.S. government and civilian networks. PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to target government and critical infrastructure networks with an increasing array of new and adaptive techniques\u2014some of which pose a significant risk to Information Technology Sector organizations (including telecommunications providers), Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizations, and other critical infrastructure organizations.\n \n\n\n\n PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities and use publicly available tools to target networks of interest. NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC state\\-sponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks. See Table 1 for the top used CVEs.\n \n\n\n\n*Table I: Top CVEs most used by Chinese state\\-sponsored cyber actors since 2020* \n\n\n\n\n\n| Vendor | CVE | Vulnerability Type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Apache Log4j | CVE\\-2021\\-44228 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Pulse Connect Secure | CVE\\-2019\\-11510 | Arbitrary File Read |\n| GitLab CE/EE | CVE\\-2021\\-22205 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Atlassian | CVE\\-2022\\-26134 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Microsoft Exchange | CVE\\-2021\\-26855 | Remote Code Execution |\n| F5 Big\\-IP | CVE\\-2020\\-5902 | Remote Code Execution |\n| VMware vCenter Server | CVE\\-2021\\-22005 | Arbitrary File Upload |\n| Citrix ADC | CVE\\-2019\\-19781 | Path Traversal |\n| Cisco Hyperflex | CVE\\-2021\\-1497 | Command Line Execution |\n| Buffalo WSR | CVE\\-2021\\-20090 | Relative Path Traversal |\n| Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center | CVE\\-2021\\-26084 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Hikvision Webserver | CVE\\-2021\\-36260 | Command Injection |\n| Sitecore XP | CVE\\-2021\\-42237 | Remote Code Execution |\n| F5 Big\\-IP | CVE\\-2022\\-1388 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Apache | CVE\\-2022\\-24112 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing |\n| ZOHO | CVE\\-2021\\-40539 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-26857 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-26858 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Microsoft | CVE\\-2021\\-27065 | Remote Code Execution |\n| Apache HTTP Server | CVE\\-2021\\-41773 | Path Traversal |\n\n\n\n These state\\-sponsored actors continue to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to obfuscate their activities and target web\\-facing applications to establish initial access. Many of the CVEs indicated in Table 1 allow the actors to surreptitiously gain unauthorized access into sensitive networks, after which they seek to establish persistence and move laterally to other internally connected networks.

Prioritize patching vulnerabilities identified in this CSA and other\n [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) \n .\n* Utilize phishing\\-resistant multi\\-factor authentication whenever possible. Require all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords, and change passwords immediately if there are indications that a password may have been compromised.\n* Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge.\n* Upgrade or replace end\\-of\\-life devices.\n* Move toward the Zero Trust security model.\n* Enable robust logging of Internet\\-facing systems and monitor the logs for anomalous activity.\n\n\nAppendix A\n----------\n\n\n\n*Table II: Apache CVE\\-2021\\-44228* \n\n\n\n\n\n| Apache CVE\\-2021\\-44228 CVSS 3\\.0: 10 (Critical) |\n| --- |\n| Vulnerability Description      Apache Log4j2 2\\.0\\-beta9 through 2\\.15\\.0 (excluding security releases 2\\.12\\.2, 2\\.12\\.3, and 2\\.3\\.1\\) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against malicious actor controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.
