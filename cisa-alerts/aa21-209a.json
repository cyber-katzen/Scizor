However, entities worldwide can mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this report by applying the available patches to their systems and implementing a centralized patch management system.\u00a0\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nKey Findings\nIn 2020, cyber actors readily exploited recently disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched systems. Based on available data to the U.S. Government, a majority of the top vulnerabilities targeted in 2020 were disclosed during the past two years. Cyber actor exploitation of more recently disclosed software flaws in 2020 probably stems, in part, from the expansion of remote work options amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid shift and increased use of remote work options, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and cloud-based environments, likely placed additional burden on cyber defenders struggling to maintain and keep pace with routine software patching.\nFour of the most targeted vulnerabilities in 2020 affected remote work, VPNs, or cloud-based technologies. Many VPN gateway devices remained unpatched during 2020, with the growth of remote work options challenging the ability of organizations to conduct rigorous patch management.\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI consider the vulnerabilities listed in table 1 to be the topmost regularly exploited CVEs by cyber actors during 2020.\u00a0\nTable 1:Top Routinely Exploited CVEs in 2020\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n\n\nCVE\n\n\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitrix\n\n\nCVE-2019-19781\n\n\narbitrary code execution\n\n\n\n\nPulse\n\n\nCVE 2019-11510\n\n\narbitrary file reading\n\n\n\n\nFortinet\n\n\nCVE 2018-13379\n\n\npath traversal\n\n\n\n\nF5- Big IP\n\n\nCVE 2020-5902\n\n\nremote code execution (RCE)\n\n\n\n\nMobileIron\n\n\nCVE 2020-15505\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nCVE-2017-11882\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nAtlassian\n\n\nCVE-2019-11580\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nDrupal\n\n\nCVE-2018-7600\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nTelerik\n\n\nCVE 2019-18935\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nCVE-2019-0604\n\n\nRCE\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nCVE-2020-0787\n\n\nelevation of privilege\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\nCVE-2020-1472\n\n\nelevation of privilege\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn 2021, malicious cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. Among those highly exploited in 2021 are vulnerabilities in Microsoft, Pulse, Accellion, VMware, and Fortinet.\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI assess that public and private organizations worldwide remain vulnerable to compromise from the exploitation of these CVEs. Malicious cyber actors will most likely continue to use older known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-11882 affecting Microsoft Office, as long as they remain effective and systems remain unpatched. Adversaries\u2019 use of known vulnerabilities complicates attribution, reduces costs, and minimizes risk because they are not investing in developing a zero-day exploit for their exclusive use, which they risk losing if it becomes known.\u00a0\nOrganizations are encouraged to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of exploitation. Most can be remediated by patching and updating systems. Organizations that have not remediated these vulnerabilities should investigate for the presence of IOCs and, if compromised, initiate incident response and recovery plans. See the Contact Information section below for how to reach CISA to report an incident or request technical assistance.\n2020 CVEs\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI have identified the following as the topmost exploited vulnerabilities by malicious cyber actors from 2020: CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-5902, CVE-2020-15505, CVE-2020-0688, CVE-2019-3396, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2019-11580, CVE-2018-7600, CVE 2019-18935, CVE-2019-0604, CVE-2020-0787, CVE-2020-1472.[1][2][3] Among these vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-19781 was the most exploited flaw in 2020, according to U.S. Government technical analysis.CVE-2019-19781 is a recently disclosed critical vulnerability in Citrix\u2019s Application Delivery Controller (ADC)\u2014a load balancing application for web, application, and database servers widely use throughout the United States.[4][5] Nation-state and criminal cyber actors most likely favor using this vulnerability because it is easy to exploit, Citrix servers are widespread, and exploitation enables the actors to perform unauthorized RCE on a target system.[6]\u00a0\nIdentified as emerging targets in early 2020,[7] unremediated instances of CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2019-11510 continued to be exploited throughout the year by nation-state advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) who leveraged these and other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-13379[8][9], in VPN services[10][11] to compromise an array of organizations, including those involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.[12][13]\nThe CVE-2019-11510 vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure VPN was also frequently targeted by nation-state APTs. Actors can exploit the vulnerability to steal the unencrypted credentials for all users on a compromised Pulse VPN server and retain unauthorized credentials for all users on a compromised Pulse VPN server and can retain unauthorize access after the system is patched unless all compromised credentials are changed. Nation-state APTs also commonly exploited CVE-2020-15505 and CVE-2020-5902.[14][15][16][17]\n2021 CVEs\nIn 2021, cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. In addition to the 2020 CVEs listed above, organizations should prioritize patching for the following CVEs known to be exploited.\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft Exchange: CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065\u00a0\n\nSee CISA\u2019s Alert: Mitigate Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities for more information on identifying and mitigating malicious activity concerning these vulnerabilities.\n\n\nPulse Secure: CVE-2021-22893, CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900\n\nSee CISA\u2019s Alert: Exploitation of Pulse Connect Secure Vulnerabilities for more information on how to investigate and mitigate this malicious activity.\n\n\nAccellion: CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103, CVE-2021-27104\n\nSee the Australia-New Zealand-Singapore-UK-U.S. Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Exploitation of Accellion File Transfer Appliance for technical details and mitigations.\n\n\nVMware: CVE-2021-21985\n\nSee CISA\u2019s Current Activity: Unpatched VMware vCenter Software for more information and guidance.\u00a0\n\n\nFortinet: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591\u00a0\n\nSee the CISA-FBI Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: APT Actors Exploit Vulnerabilities to Gain Initial Access for Future Attacks for more details and mitigations.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMitigations and Indicators of Compromise\nOne of the most effective best practices to mitigate many vulnerabilities is to update software versions once patches are available and as soon as is practicable. If this is not possible, consider applying temporary workarounds or other mitigations, if provided by the vendor. If an organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for CVEs that are already known to be exploited or that would be accessible to the largest number of potential attackers (such as internet-facing systems). This advisory highlights vulnerabilities that should be considered as part of the prioritization process. To further assist remediation, automatic software updates should be enabled whenever possible.\u00a0\nFocusing scarce cyber defense resources on patching those vulnerabilities that cyber actors most often use offers the potential of bolstering network security while impeding our adversaries\u2019 operations. For example, nation-state APTs in 2020 extensively relied on a single RCE vulnerability discovered in the Atlassian Crow, a centralized identity management and application (CVE-2019-11580) in its reported operations. A concerted focus on patching this vulnerability could have a relative broad impact by forcing the actors to find alternatives, which may not have the same broad applicability to their target set.\u00a0\nAdditionally, attackers commonly exploit weak authentication processes, particularly in external-facing devices. Organizations should require multi-factor authentication to remotely access networks from external sources, especially for administrator or privileged accounts.\nTables 2\u201314 provide more details about, and specific mitigations for, each of the top exploited CVEs in 2020.\u00a0\nNote: The lists of associated malware corresponding to each CVE below are not meant to be exhaustive but intended to identify a malware family commonly associated with exploiting the CVE.\n\u00a0\nTable 2: CVE-2019-19781 Vulnerability Details\n\n\n\n\nCitrix Netscaler Directory Traversal (CVE-2019-19781)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Description\n\t\t\tCitrix Netscaler Application Delivery Control (ADC) is vulnerable to RCE and full system compromise due to poor access controls, thus allowing directory traversal.\u00a0\n\n\nCVSS 3.02\u00a0\nCritical\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns\nThe lack of adequate access controls allows an attacker to enumerate system directories for vulnerable code (directory traversal). In this instance, Citrix ADC maintains a vulnerable Perl script (newbm.pl) that, when accessed via HTTP POST request (POST https://$TARGET/vpn/../vpn/portal/scripts/newbm.pl), allows local operating system (OS) commands to execute. Attackers can use this functionality to upload/execute command and control (C2) software (webshell or reverse-shell executable) using embedded commands (e.g., curl, wget, Invoke-WebRequest) and gain unauthorized access to the OS.\u00a0\nMultiple malware campaigns, including NOTROBIN, have taken advantage of this vulnerability.\n\n\nFix\nPatch Available\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations\n\nImplement the appropriate refresh build according to the vulnerability details outlined by the vendor: Citrix: Mitigation Steps for CVE-2019-19781\nIf possible, only allow the VPN to communicate with known Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (allow-list).\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods\n\nCISA has developed a free detection tool for this vulnerability: cisagov/check-cve-2019-19781: Test a host for susceptibility to CVE-2019-19781.\nNmap developed a script that can be used with the port scanning engine: CVE-2019-19781 - Citrix ADC Path Traversal #1893.\nCitrix also developed a free tool for detecting compromises of Citrix ADC Appliances related to CVE-2019-19781: Citrix / CVE-2019-19781: IOC Scanner for CVE-2019-19781.\nCVE-2019-19781 is commonly exploited to install web shell malware.

It is also known as the \"Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\"\u00a0\nCyber actors continued to exploit this four-year-old vulnerability in Microsoft Office that the U.S. Government publicly assessed last year was the most frequently targeted. Cyber actors most likely continue to exploit this vulnerability because Microsoft Office use is ubiquitous worldwide, the vulnerability is ideal for phasing campaigns, and it enables RCE on vulnerable systems.\n\n\nCVSS 3.0\nHigh\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns\nMicrosoft Equation Editor, a component of Microsoft Office, contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that enables RCE on a vulnerable system. The component was compiled on November 9, 2000. Without any further recompilation, it was used in all currently supported versions of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server that is hosted by eqnedt32.exe, meaning it runs as its own process and can accept commands from other processes.\nData execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR) should protect against such attacks. However, because of the manner in which eqnedt32.exe was linked, it will not use these features, subsequently allowing code execution. Being an out-of-process COM server, protections specific to Microsoft Office such as EMET and Windows Defender Exploit Guard are not applicable to eqnedt32.exe, unless applied system-wide. This provides the attacker with an avenue to lure targets into opening specially crafted documents, resulting in the ability to execute an embedded attacker commands.\nMultiple cyber espionage campaigns have taken advantage of this vulnerability. CISA has noted CVE-2017-11882 being exploited to deliver LokiBot malware.\n\n\nFix\nPatch Available\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations\n\nTo remediate this issue, administrators should deploy Microsoft\u2019s patch for this vulnerability: https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882.\nThose who cannot deploy the patch should consider disabling the Equation Editor as discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4055535.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Methods\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus, Windows Defender, Microsoft Security Essentials, and the Microsoft Safety Scanner will all detect and patch this vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Office 2013 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Office 2016 are vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nNIST NVD Vulnerability Detail: CVE-2017-11882\nCISA Malware Analysis Report: MAR-10211350-1.v2\nPalo Alto Networks Analysis: Analysis of CVE-2017-11882 Exploit in the Wild\nCERT Coordination Center Vulnerability Note: Microsoft Office Equation Editor stack buffer overflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTable 10: CVE 2019-11580 Vulnerability Details\n\n\n\nAtlassian Crowd and Crowd Data Center Remote Code Execution (CVE 2019-11580)\n\n\n\nVulnerability Description\nAtlassian Crowd and Crowd Data Center had the pdkinstall development plugin incorrectly enabled in release builds.\n\n\nCVSS 3.0\nCritical\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns\nAttackers who can send unauthenticated or authenticated requests to a Crowd or Crowd Data Center instance can exploit this vulnerability to install arbitrary plugins, which permits RCE on systems running a vulnerable version of Crowd or Crowd Data Center.\n\n\nFix\nPatch Available\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Mitigations\n\nAtlassian recommends customers running a version of Crowd below version 3.3.0 to upgrade to version 3.2.8.
