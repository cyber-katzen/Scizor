The researcher states that the vulnerabilities fall within two classifications: twelve involve integer overflows;CWE-190: Integer Overflow, Common Weakness Enumeration, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html, accessed March 31, 2011. one involves memory corruption.CWE-415: Double-Free, Common Weakness Enumeration, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html, accessed March 31, 2011.\nAfter the aforementioned vulnerabilities were disclosed, a second, security researcher, Joel Langill of SCADAhacker,Joel Langill, Cyber Security to Protect Critical Infrastructure, http://scadahacker.com/, accessed April 13, 2011. is coordinating with the ICS-CERT on another vulnerability in the ICONICS GENESIS products. Mr. Langill reported a vulnerability in the SafeNet Sentinel License Monitor httpd 7.3 service on Port 6002/TCP, which is used by the ICONICS GENESIS32 and GENESIS64 application suites. That vulnerability is based on a previously reported vulnerability in the SafeNet Sentinel License Monitor service.CVE-2007-6483 (under review), National Vulnerability Database, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-6483, accessed April 4, 2011. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to allow directory traversal on the host machine.\nICONICS has validated the reported vulnerabilities and released a software update that addresses all identified vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT has verified that the update released by ICONICS fully addresses all reported vulnerabilities.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe Integer overflows and Memory Corruption vulnerabilities affect ICONICS GENESIS32 and GENESIS64. Versions affected are:\n\nGENESIS32 Version 9.21 and prior\nGENESIS64 Version 10.51 and prior.\n\nDirectory Traversal Vulnerability\nThe directory traversal vulnerability affects all versions of GENESIS32 and GENESIS64 that utilize SafeNet Sentinel License Monitor service (Versions 7.0 through 7.4). The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) includes an unconfirmed report that versions prior to 7.0 may also be vulnerable.e According to ICONICS, vulnerable versions of the SafeNet service could exist in the following versions of the GENESIS application suite:\n\nGENESIS32 and GENESIS 64 (Versions 8.05, 9.1, 9.2, and 10)\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker successfully exploiting these identified vulnerabilities could remotely execute arbitrary code, create data leakage, or initiate a denial of service (DoS). The actual impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nICONICS is a US based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, India, Germany, France, Czech Republic, China, and Australia.\nThe affected products, GENESIS32 and GENESIS64, are web based HMI SCADA systems. According to ICONICS, GENESIS is deployed across several sectors including manufacturing, building automation, oil and gas, water and wastewater, electric utilities, and others. ICONICS estimates that 55% of GENESIS installations are in the United States, 45% are in Europe, and 5% are in Asia.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVulnerability Overview\nThe publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affect the GenBroker.exe on Port 38080/TCP, which is an OPC-based communications service. If exploited, this vulnerability provides access to a core application used to manage communications between clients and servers. This service is vulnerable to integer overflow and memory corruption conditions. All these vulnerabilities are potentially remotely exploitable.\nDirectory Traversal Vulnerability\nThis vulnerability in the ICONICS GENESIS32 and GENESIS64 application suites affects the SafeNet Sentinel License Monitor service on Port 6002/TCP, through a previously reported vulnerability of that service.CVE-2007-6483 (under review), National Vulnerability Database, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-6483, accessed April 4, 2011. The ICONICS GENESIS32 and GENESIS64 application suites use this service as part of product licensing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to allow directory traversal on the host machine, potentially gaining additional privileges that could facilitate malicious acts against the vulnerable system.\nInteger Overflows and Memory Corruption Vulnerability Details\nExploitability\nAn attacker can remotely exploit all the identified vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable GenBroker.exe application. An attacker could craft a malicious payload that could be remotely executed.\nExistence of Exploit\nPoC code is publicly available for all 13 reported vulnerabilities.\nDifficulty\nThis vulnerability requires moderate skill to exploit.\nDirectory Traversal Vulnerability Details\nExploitability\nAn attacker could remotely exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable SafeNet Sentinel License Monitor service on Port (6002/TCP).\nExistence of Exploit\nNo publicly available exploit code is known to exist that specifically targets this vulnerability.\nDifficulty\nThis vulnerability requires moderate skill to exploit.\nMITIGATION\nICONICS has addressed these vulnerabilities with a software update, which is available on the company\u2019s website: http://www.iconics.com/certs.\nFor additional product support, contact ICONICS by phone at (508) 543-8600 or by e-mail at support@iconics.com.\nIn addition to software updating, ICS-CERT recommends the following mitigations:\n\nUse a firewall to restrict unnecessary or unwanted traffic, specifically to the affected Ports 38080/TCP and 6002/TCP.\nIf an intrusion detection system (IDS) is used, update to the latest IDS signatures.\nMinimize exposure of vulnerable systems to external networks. If remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nThe Control System Security Program also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the US-CERT website. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\n",
