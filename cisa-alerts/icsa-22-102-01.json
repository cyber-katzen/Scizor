EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 8\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Exploitable from an adjacent network /low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  Valmet* **Equipment:**  DNA* **Vulnerability:**  Inadequate Encryption Strength2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely with system privileges.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of Valmet DNA, a distributed control system, are affected:* Valmet DNA: Versions from Collection 2012 to Collection 2021### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE\\-326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html) An unauthenticated network user can craft specific packets targeting a Valmet DNA service, listening by default on a specific TCP port. By exploiting a predictable encryption key, the attacker can remotely trigger commands to be executed with system privileges.[CVE\\-2021\\-26726](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-26726)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  Finland### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Ivan Speziale of Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to Valmet.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Valmet recommends the following:* Update to the latest version. Contact [Valmet customer service](https://www.valmet.com/about-us/contact-us/)  to obtain the update.* Ensure a properly configured firewall is in place to prevent unauthorized access from untrusted networks to the system. For more information see [Valmet's Security Advisory](https://www.valmet.com/about-us/research-and-development/vulnerabilityadvisories/valmet-dna-remote-code-execution/)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
