Eaton Lighting Systems has produced a firmware patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nEaton Lighting Systems reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:\n\nEG2 Web Control V4.04P and prior.\n\nIMPACT\nA remote attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to perform administrative operations allowing the EG2 connection to configure the system via the Internet rather than by connecting directly into the network.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nEaton Lighting Systems is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide.\nThe affected products, EG2 Web Control, facilitate Internet and Wi-Fi LAN connection into the iLumin network. According to Eaton Lighting Systems, these products are used primarily in residential applications. Eaton Lighting Systems estimates these products are used worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nRELIANCE ON COOKIES WITHOUT VALIDATION AND INTEGRITY CHECKINGCWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/565.html, web site last accessed March 01, 2016.\n\nAttackers can easily modify cookies within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside the browser.\nCVE-2016-2272NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2272, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N, web site last accessed March 01, 2016.\n\nCLEARTEXT STORAGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATIONCWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html, web site last accessed March 01, 2016.\n\nAn unauthorized user can directly access configuration file to view credentials.\nCVE-2016-0871NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0871, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March 01, 2016\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThese vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nMITIGATION\nEaton Lighting Systems has made the decision to remove this functionality from the device. The EG2 is a legacy product that is being moved to \u201cend-of-life\u201d later this year. A new hardware and OS platform is replacing this system. Eaton Lighting Systems has produced a firmware patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nPlease contact Eaton Lighting Systems for advice on updating the firmware.\nEurope, Middle East, and Asia:\n+44 (0)844 324 9100 (available Mon-Fri 9am-5pm GMT)\nTechSupportCC@eaton.com\nAmericas:\n1-800-553-3879\n1-800-954-7016\ncontroltechsupport@eaton.com\nOr visit the Eaton cybersecurity web site www.eaton.com/cybersecurity for additional information.\nICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In addition, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at:\u00a0http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
