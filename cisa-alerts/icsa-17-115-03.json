[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryHyundai Motor America Blue Link=============================== Last Revised April 25, 2017 Alert Code ICSA\\-17\\-115\\-03### **CVSS v3 7\\.5****ATTENTION:**  Remotely exploitable**Vendor:**  Hyundai Motor America**Equipment:**  Blue Link**Vulnerability:**  Man\\-in\\-the\\-Middle, Use of Hard\\-Coded Cryptographic KeyAFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following versions of Blue Link, a mobile application for Hyundai vehicle management, are affected:* Blue Link Version 3\\.9\\.5, and* Blue Link Version 3\\.9\\.4\\.IMPACT------ Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to gain access to insecurely transmitted sensitive information, which could allow the attacker to locate, unlock, and start a vehicle associated with the affected application. Rapid7 working with Hyundai Motor America reports that it would be difficult to impossible to conduct this attack at scale, since an attacker would typically need to first subvert physically local networks, or gain a privileged position on the network path from the app user to their service instance.MITIGATION---------- Hyundai Motor America released Blue Link, Version 3\\.9\\.6, a mandatory update to the application, which mitigates the aforementioned vulnerabilities on March 6, 2017, for Android devices and March 8, 2017, for iOS devices. Rapid7 has released a security advisory that can be found at [https://community.rapid7\\.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/04/25/r7\\-2017\\-02\\-hyundai\\-blue\\-link\\-potential\\-info\\-disclosure\\-fixed](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/04/25/r7-2017-02-hyundai-blue-link-potential-info-disclosure-fixed)  ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[MAN\\-IN\\-THE\\-MIDDLE CWE\\-300](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Communication channel endpoints are not verified, which may allow a remote attacker to access or influence communications between the identified endpoints.[CVE\\-2017\\-6052](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6052)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
