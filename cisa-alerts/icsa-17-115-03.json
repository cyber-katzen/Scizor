Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n , that is available for download from the\n [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n----------------------\n\n\n\n[MAN\\-IN\\-THE\\-MIDDLE CWE\\-300](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n Communication channel endpoints are not verified, which may allow a remote attacker to access or influence communications between the identified endpoints.\n \n\n\n\n[CVE\\-2017\\-6052](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6052) \n has been assigned to this vulnerability.
