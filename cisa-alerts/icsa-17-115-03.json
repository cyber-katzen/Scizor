Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. High skill level is needed to exploit.\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nMAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE CWE-300\n\nCommunication channel endpoints are not verified, which may allow a remote attacker to access or influence communications between the identified endpoints.\nCVE-2017-6052 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n\nUSE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321\n\nThe application uses a hard-coded decryption password to protect sensitive user information.\nCVE-2017-6054 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\nRESEARCHER\nThese vulnerabilities were discovered by Will Hatzer and Arjun Kumar working with Rapid7.\nBACKGROUND\nCritical Infrastructure Sector(s): Transportation Systems\nCountries/Areas Deployed: United States\nCompany Headquarters Location: Fountain Valley, California\n",
