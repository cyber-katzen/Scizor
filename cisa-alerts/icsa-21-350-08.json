MITIGATIONS\n---------------\n\n\n\n Siemens recommends updating to the latest versions, specifically:\n \n\n\n* JT Utilities:\n [Update to v13\\.0\\.3\\.0 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)\n* JTTK:\n [Update to v11\\.0\\.3\\.0 or later version](https://support.sw.siemens.com/)\n\n\n\n Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n \n\n\n* Avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources using JTTK\n* Avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources using JT Utilities\n\n\n\n As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to\n [Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) \n , and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.\n \n\n\n\n For more information about these vulnerabilities, please see Siemens security advisory\n [SSA\\-352143](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-352143.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact S\n [iemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories) \n .\n \n\n\n\n CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n CISA also provides a section for\n [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) \n on the ICS webpage on\n [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) \n . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including\n [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the\n [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) \n in the Technical Information Paper,\n [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n \n\n\n\n No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
