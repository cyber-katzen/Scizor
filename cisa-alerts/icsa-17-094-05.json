Specifically, users should:* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol\\-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222/TCP and UDP and Port 44818/TCP and UDP using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270 which is available at the following location:<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/898270>* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and help confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and use best practices when isolating them from the business network. The Common Plant\\-wide Ethernet (CPwE) guide provides recommendations for deploying a plant\\-wide architecture: Industrial Firewalls within a CPwE Architecture* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  on the ICS\\-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the [ICS\\-CERT web site](/ics/)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\\-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW----------------------[RESOURCE EXHAUSTION CWE\\-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This vulnerability may allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition by sending a series of specific CIP\\-based commands to the controller.[CVE\\-2017\\-6024](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6024)  has been assigned to this vulnerability.
