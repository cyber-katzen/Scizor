ProSoft Technology has produced a new firmware patch that mitigates this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following ProSoft Technology RadioLinx ControlScape versions are affected:\n\nRadioLinx ControlScape, versions prior to version FH v6.00.040\n\nIMPACT\nThe researchers have identified a vulnerability within the implementation of the PRNG that generates the passphrase. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to forecast automatically generated passwords, thus aiding in brute-force attacks.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nProSoft Technology is a US-based company with headquarters located in Bakersfield, California. Business offices are located worldwide in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.\nThe affected product, ProSoft Technology RadioLinx ControlScape, is used for radio frequency communication with field-based automation controllers\u2014primarily Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric. The device provides connectivity between dissimilar systems over the Ethernet.\nAccording to ProSoft Technology, RadioLinx ControlScape software is deployed worldwide across several sectors including oil and gas, water and wastewater, and electric utilities.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nUSE OF CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY WEAK PRNGCWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html, Web site last accessed September 05, 2013.\n\nThis product uses standard C Run-Time libraries srand and rand calls to seed and generate passphrases. By using the same seed, an attacker could predict default values built into the software, leaving the system vulnerable to expedited brute-force passphrase/password attacks. Custom passphrases are less vulnerable to this type of attack.\nCVE-2013-2803NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2803, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 9.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, Web site last visited September 05, 2013.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nProSoft Technology has released a new firmware patch, v6.00.040, which is available from the ProSoft Technology download page:\n\nhttp://www.prosoft-technology.com/SERVICES-SUPPORT/Downloads.\n\nClick on the ProSoft Software tab, then click on the ControlScape tab, and then click on the ControlScape FH v6.00.040 link to download the new firmware patch.\nProSoft has the following additional recommendations:\n\nChanging the default \u2018seed\u2019 passphrase will greatly increase the entropy of passphrase generation process.\n\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed September 05, 2013.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed September 05, 2013.\u00a0that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
