[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisoryAzeoTech DAQFactory=================== Last Revised November 04, 2021 Alert Code ICSA\\-21\\-308\\-021\\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  AzeoTech* **Equipment:**  DAQFactory* **Vulnerabilities:**  Use of Inherently Dangerous Function, Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Modification of Assumed\\-Immutable Data (MAID)2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow code execution, memory corruption, or unauthorized access to user information.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of DAQFactory, a software and application development platform, are affected:* DAQFactory: All Versions 18\\.1 Build 2347 and prior### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW#### 3\\.2\\.1 [USE OF INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FUNCTION CWE\\-242](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html) The affected application uses specific functions that could be abused through a crafted project file, which could lead to code execution, system reboot, and system shutdown.[CVE\\-2021\\-42543](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42543)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.2 [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE\\-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) Project files are stored memory objects in the form of binary serialized data that can later be read and deserialized again to instantiate the original objects in memory. Malicious manipulation of these files may allow an attacker to corrupt memory.[CVE\\-2021\\-42698](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42698)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.3 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE\\-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html) The affected product is vulnerable to cookie information being transmitted as cleartext over HTTP. An attacker can capture network traffic, obtain the user\u2019s cookie and take over the account.[CVE\\-2021\\-42699](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42699)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  ).#### 3\\.2\\.4 [MODIFICATION OF ASSUMED\\-IMMUTABLE DATA (MAID) CWE\\-471](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html) An attacker could prepare a specially crafted project file that, if opened, would attempt to connect to the cloud and trigger a man in the middle (MiTM) attack. This could allow an attacker to obtain credentials and take over the user\u2019s cloud account.[CVE\\-2021\\-42701](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42701)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5\\.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  United States and Europe* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Sharon Brizinov of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- AzeoTech is targeting a new release of DAQFactory for early 2022\\. AzeoTech recommends users take the following actions to reduce the risk:* Users are discouraged from using documents from unknown/untrusted sources.* Users are encouraged to store .ctl files in a folder only writeable by admin\\-level users.* Users are encouraged to operate in \u201cSafe Mode\u201d when loading documents that have been out of their control.* Users are encouraged to apply a document editing password to their documents.* Users should avoid using the Real Time Web\\-Connect menu items and instead connect to DAQConnect using script. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
