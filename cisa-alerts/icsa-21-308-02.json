EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: AzeoTech\nEquipment: DAQFactory\nVulnerabilities: Use of Inherently Dangerous Function, Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow code execution, memory corruption, or unauthorized access to user information.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of DAQFactory, a software and application development platform, are affected:\n\nDAQFactory: All Versions 18.1 Build 2347 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE OF INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FUNCTION CWE-242\nThe affected application uses specific functions that could be abused through a crafted project file, which could lead to code execution, system reboot, and system shutdown.\nCVE-2021-42543 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502\nProject files are stored memory objects in the form of binary serialized data that can later be read and deserialized again to instantiate the original objects in memory. Malicious manipulation of these files may allow an attacker to corrupt memory.\nCVE-2021-42698 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319\nThe affected product is vulnerable to cookie information being transmitted as cleartext over HTTP. An attacker can capture network traffic, obtain the user\u2019s cookie and take over the account.\nCVE-2021-42699 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MODIFICATION OF ASSUMED-IMMUTABLE DATA (MAID) CWE-471\nAn attacker could prepare a specially crafted project file that, if opened, would attempt to connect to the cloud and trigger a man in the middle (MiTM) attack. This could allow an attacker to obtain credentials and take over the user\u2019s cloud account.\nCVE-2021-42701 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: United States and Europe\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSharon Brizinov of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAzeoTech is targeting a new release of DAQFactory for early 2022.\nAzeoTech recommends users take the following actions to reduce the risk:\n\nUsers are discouraged from using documents from unknown/untrusted sources.\nUsers are encouraged to store .ctl files in a folder only writeable by admin-level users.\nUsers are encouraged to operate in \u201cSafe Mode\u201d when loading documents that have been out of their control.\nUsers are encouraged to apply a document editing password to their documents.\nUsers should avoid using the Real Time Web-Connect menu items and instead connect to DAQConnect using script.\n\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
