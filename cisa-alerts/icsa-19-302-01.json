CERT@VDE coordinated this vulnerability with Phoenix Contact.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- Phoenix Contact is in the process of developing an updated version of this product. Prior to receiving the updated version, Phoenix Contact strongly recommends users exchange project files using only secure file exchange services, and that project files should not be exchanged via unencrypted email. Phoenix Contact expects the next version of the Automation Worx Suite to be available prior to the end of 2019, noting the upcoming release of Automation Worx Software Suite will have a more robust validation of arrays regarding dimension and the number of elements allowed during input data conversion. In addition, input data validation will be extended in order to strengthen defenses against manipulated project files. Additional preventative security measures will be enabled for the compiler settings as well. CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics)  .
