SubSTATION Server software application. SUBNET Solutions Inc. has produced a new version that mitigates this vulnerability. SUBNET Solutions Inc. has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following SUBNET Solutions Inc. products are affected:\n\nSubSTATION Server v2.7.0033, and\nSubSTATION Server v2.8.0106.\n\nIMPACT\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to affect the availability of the DNP3 Slave service in the SUBNET Solutions Inc. SubSTATION Server software.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS\u2011CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSUBNET Solutions Inc. is a Canada-based company that maintains offices in Canada and the US.\nThe affected product, SubSTATION Server, is a substation communication server deployed across the energy sector worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\nIMPROPER INPUT VALIDATIONCWE-20: Improper Input Validation, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html, Web site last accessed September 09, 2013.\nThe DNP3 Slave service in SUBNET Solutions Inc. SubSTATION Server does not validate or incorrectly validates input. An attacker could introduce an unhandled exception, causing the process to crash. If settings are configured to automatically restart, the DNP3 Slave service will automatically restart and resume communications. Otherwise, the system must be restarted manually.\nCVE-2013-2788NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2788, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE Web site report. This Web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, Web site last accessed September 09, 2013.\n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\u00a0\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a moderate skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSUBNET Solutions Inc. has produced a new version of SubSTATION Server that is available for download. To arrange access to a secure download of the updated version, please contact SUBNET Solutions Inc. Technical Services by e-mail at support@subnet.com or by phone at 403-270-8885 Monday through Friday from 9 am to 5 pm Mountain time.\nICS\u2011CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.CSSP Recommended Practices, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices, Web site last accessed September 09, 2013.\u00a0ICS\u2011CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS\u2011CERT Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies,Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B, Web site last accessed September 09, 2013.\u00a0that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/).\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS\u2011CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\n",
