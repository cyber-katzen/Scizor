EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit\nVendor: Siemens\nEquipment: SIMATIC TDC CP51M1\nVulnerability: Improper Input Validation\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could create a denial-of-service condition within UDP communication.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of SIMATIC TDC CP51M1, a multiprocessor automation system, are affected:\n\nSIMATIC TDC CP51M1: All versions prior to 1.1.7\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20\nAn attacker sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the device may affect the UDP communication, causing a denial-of-service condition.\nCVE-2019-10937 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens recommends users update to Version 1.1.7 or later. Updates can be obtained at the following link:\nhttps://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/27049282\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users may apply to reduce the risk:\n\nRestrict network access to affected devices\nRestrict UDP communication to affected devices\nDo not use UDP communication in the user program if not needed\nApply cell protection concept and implement defense in depth\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens\u2019 operational guidelines for industrial security (download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:\u00a0\nhttps://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor more information, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-250618 at the following location:\nhttp://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\n",
