[News \\& Events](/news-events) ICS AdvisorySchneider Electric CitectSCADA Products Exception Handler Vulnerability (Update A)================================================================================== Last Revised September 06, 2018 Alert Code ICSA\\-13\\-350\\-01AOVERVIEW--------### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** This updated advisory is a follow\\-up to the original advisory titled ICSA\\-13\\-350\\-01 Schneider Electric SCADA Products Exception Handler Vulnerability that was published February\u00a025,\u00a02014, on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site. This advisory was originally posted to the US\\-CERT secure Portal library on December 16, 2013\\. Schneider Electric requested the title change to reduce confusion.### **\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- End Update A Part 1 of 1 \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-** Researcher Carsten Eiram of Risk Based Security has identified an exception handling vulnerability in Schneider Electric\u2019s CitectSCADA application. The original vulnerability reported by Mr. Eiram had already been fixed in CitectSCADA v7\\.20SP2\\. While investigating this vulnerability report, Schneider Electric discovered additional related vulnerabilities and has produced a patch that mitigates them in SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect, CitectSCADA, and PowerSCADA Expert. Mr. Eiram has tested the patch to validate that it resolves all the above vulnerabilities in CitectSCADA. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.AFFECTED PRODUCTS----------------- The following Schneider Electric versions are affected:* StruxureWare SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect v7\\.40,* Vijeo Citect v7\\.20 to v7\\.30SP1,* CitectSCADA v7\\.20 to v7\\.30SP1,* StruxureWare PowerSCADA Expert v7\\.30 to v7\\.30SR1, and* PowerLogic SCADA v7\\.20 to v7\\.20SR1\\.IMPACT------ An attacker can cause a denial of service in this product by exploiting this vulnerability. The software would need to be restarted to recover from a successful denial\\-of\\-service attack. Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.BACKGROUND---------- Schneider Electric is a France\\-based multinational corporation. Schneider Electric is a manufacturer and integrator of energy management and industrial automation systems, equipment, and software. The affected products are web\\-based SCADA systems.

NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web page at [http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/content/recommended\\-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\u2014Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  , that is available for download from the NCCIC/ICS\\-CERT web site (http://ics\\-cert.us\\-cert.gov/).
