This advisory was originally posted to the US-CERT secure Portal library on December 16, 2013. Schneider Electric requested the title change to reduce confusion.\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ----------\nResearcher Carsten Eiram of Risk Based Security has identified an exception handling vulnerability in Schneider Electric\u2019s CitectSCADA application. The original vulnerability reported by Mr. Eiram had already been fixed in CitectSCADA v7.20SP2. While investigating this vulnerability report, Schneider Electric discovered additional related vulnerabilities and has produced a patch that mitigates them in SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect, CitectSCADA, and PowerSCADA Expert. Mr. Eiram has tested the patch to validate that it resolves all the above vulnerabilities in CitectSCADA.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Schneider Electric versions are affected:\n\nStruxureWare SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect v7.40,\nVijeo Citect v7.20 to v7.30SP1,\nCitectSCADA v7.20 to v7.30SP1,\nStruxureWare PowerSCADA Expert v7.30 to v7.30SR1, and\nPowerLogic SCADA v7.20 to v7.20SR1.\n\nIMPACT\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service in this product by exploiting this vulnerability. The software would need to be restarted to recover from a successful denial-of-service attack.\nImpact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\nBACKGROUND\nSchneider Electric is a France-based multinational corporation. Schneider Electric is a manufacturer and integrator of energy management and industrial automation systems, equipment, and software.\nThe affected products are web-based SCADA systems. The affected Schneider Electric systems are found primarily in energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure applications worldwide.\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\nVULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\nEXCEPTION HANDLING VULNERABILITYCWE-248: Uncaught Exception, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html, web site last accessed February 25, 2014.\n\nThe vulnerability could cause a denial of service on the server of the affected products. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must send a specially crafted packet to any of the server processes.\nCVE-2013-2824NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2824, web site last accessed February 26, 2014.\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed February 25, 2014.\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nEXPLOITABILITY\nThis vulnerability could be exploited remotely.\nEXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.\nDIFFICULTY\nAn attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.\nMITIGATION\nSome customers may have experienced a crash after applying the \u201csecurity & quality fix\u201d released on December 16, 2013. Schneider Electric has determined that the problem is within the quality portion of the fix. They have removed the quality fix from the release and have issued a new patch containing only the security update for this vulnerability.\nSchneider Electric has developed a cumulative patch that addresses the above security issue as well as a separate quality issue. These patches are available for all products affected:\n\nHF740RTM60777.1 for SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect v7.40, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/se-vjc-HF740RTM607771\nHF730SP160775.1 for Vijeo Citect v7.30 SP1, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/vc-HF730SP1607751\nHF720SP460769.1 for Vijeo Citect v7.20 SP4, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/vc-HF720SP4607691\nHF740RTM60777.1 for CitectSCADA v7.40, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/cs-HF740RTM607771\nHF730SP160775.1 for CitectSCADA v7.30 SP1, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/cs-HF730SP1607751\nHF720SP460769.1 for CitectSCADA v7.20 SP4, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/cs-HF720SP4607691\nHF730SP1608004 for PowerSCADA Expert v7.30 SR1, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/pse-HF730SP160804\nHF720SP460803 for PowerLogic SCADA v7.20 SR1, http://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/pls-HF720SP460803\n\nSchneider Electric recommends all customers using the affected software packages listed above download and apply the relevant patch.
