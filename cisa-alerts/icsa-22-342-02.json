UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-22-342-02 AVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere, published December 8, 2022 on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems.\u00a0\n3. RISK EVALUATION\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 6 ---------\u00a0\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated user to read files on the system, execute arbitrary code, or create a denial-of-service condition.\u00a0\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 6 ---------\u00a0\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 4 of 6 ---------\u00a0\nThe following versions of AVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere\u2014both remote human machine interface (HMI) software\u2014are affected:\u00a0\n\nInTouch Access Anywhere: 2023 and prior\u00a0\nPlant SCADA Access Anywhere: 2020 R2 and prior\n\n--------- End Update A Part 4 of 6 ---------\u00a0\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1 RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23\nAVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere versions 2020 R2 and older are vulnerable to a path traversal exploit that could allow an unauthenticated user with network access to read files on the system outside of the secure gateway web server.\u00a0\nCVE-2022-23854 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).\u00a0\n--------- Begin Update A Part 5 of 6 ---------\u00a0\n4.2.2 BUFFER COPY WITHOUT CHECKING SIZE OF INPUT ('CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW') CWE-120\u00a0\nAVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere versions 2023 and prior and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere versions 2020 R2 and prior use outdated OpenSSL versions that are vulnerable to a classic buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to create denial-of-service conditions or execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\nCVE-2021-3711 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n4.2.3 IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79\u00a0\nAVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere versions 2023 and prior and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere versions 2020 R2 and prior use versions of jQuery vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Passing HTML from untrusted sources\u2014even after sanitizing it\u2014to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code in jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0.\u00a0\nCVE-2020-11022 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).\u00a0\n--------- End Update A Part 5 of 6 ---------\u00a0\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\u00a0\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nJens Regel of CRISEC reported this vulnerability to AVEVA.\u00a0\n5. MITIGATIONS\n--------- Begin Update A Part 6 of 6 ---------\u00a0\nAVEVA recommends users uninstall their old software and reinstall the following versions: \u00a0\nInTouch Access Anywhere 2023b or later.\u00a0\nPlant SCADA Access Anywhere 2023 or later.\u00a0\nHotfixes for these vulnerabilities on older software versions are not available.\u00a0\nFor additional information, please refer to AVEVA\u2019s security advisory AVEVA-2023-001.\u00a0\n--------- End Update A Part 6 of 6 ---------\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n",
