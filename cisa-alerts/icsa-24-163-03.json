EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v4 7.0\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: AVEVA\nEquipment: PI Asset Framework Client\nVulnerability: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow malicious code execution.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of AVEVA PI Asset Framework Client, a tool to model either physical or logical objects, are affected:\n\nPI Asset Framework Client: 2023\nPI Asset Framework Client: 2018 SP3 P04 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1 Deserialization of Untrusted Data CWE-502\nThere is a vulnerability in AVEVA PI Asset Framework Client that could allow malicious code to execute on the PI System Explorer environment under the privileges of an interactive user that was socially engineered to import XML supplied by an attacker.\nCVE-2024-3467 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nA CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for\u202fCVE-2024-3467. A base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United Kingdom\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nAVEVA reported this vulnerability to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Customers using affected products should apply security updates as soon as possible:\n\n(Recommended) All affected versions can be fixed by upgrading to PI AF Client 2023 Patch 1 or later:From OSI Soft Customer Portal, search for \"Asset Framework\" and select \"PI Asset Framework (AF) Client 2023 Patch 1\" or later.\n(Alternative) AF Client 2018 SP3 P04 and prior can be fixed by deploying PI AF Client 2018 SP3 Patch 5 or later:From OSI Soft Customer Portal, search for \"Asset Framework\" and select either \"PI Asset Framework (AF) Client 2018 SP3 Patch 5\" or later.\n\nAVEVA further recommends users follow general defensive measures:\n\nRun PI System Explorer as a least privilege interactive account when possible.\nEstablish procedures for verifying the source of XML is trusted before importing into PI System Explorer.\n\nFor additional information please refer to AVEVA-2024-004\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nCISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n5. UPDATE HISTORY\n\nJune 11, 2024: Initial Publication\n\n",
