EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION: Low attack complexity\nVendor: Fuji Electric\nEquipment: Tellus Lite V-Simulator, and V-Server Lite\nVulnerabilities: Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Out-of-bounds Write, Untrusted Pointer Dereference, Out-of-bounds Read, Access of Uninitialized Pointer, Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause data corruption, read sensitive information, obtain code execution, or crash the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Fuji Electric remote monitoring and operation software products are affected:\n\nV-Server Lite: Versions prior to v4.0.12.0\nTellus Lite V-Simulator: Versions prior to v4.0.12.0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121\nThe affected product is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to achieve code execution.\nCVE-2021-38413 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which can result in data corruption, a system crash, or code execution.\nCVE-2021-38419 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0UNTRUSTED POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-822\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an untrusted pointer dereference, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and cause the application to crash.\nCVE-2021-38401 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which may allow an attacker to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash.\nCVE-2021-38421 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ACCESS OF UNINITIALIZED POINTER CWE-824\nThe affected product is vulnerable to an access of uninitialized pointer, which may allow an attacker read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial-of-service.\nCVE-2021-38409 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.2.6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122\nParsing a specially crafted project file may cause a heap-based buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nCVE-2021-38415 \u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nkimiya, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, and Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nFuji Electric recommends updating software to the latest version:\n\nTELLUS Lite software: Version 4.0.12.0 Disk1\nTELLUS Lite software: Version 4.0.12.0 Disk2\nV-Server Lite software: Version 4.0.12.0 Disk1\nV-Server Lite software: Version 4.0.12.0 Disk2\n\nCISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.\n",
