RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access credentials to the hospital\u2019s clinical information systems (EMR).\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of IntelliBridge Enterprise (IBE), an interface, are affected:\n\nIntelliBridge Enterprise (IBE) Versions B.12 and prior\n\nThe IntelliBridge Enterprise (IBE) provides HL7 interface interoperability between Philips products and a hospital\u2019s clinical information system or electronic medical records by providing a single integration point to the enterprise. The IBE software and connection licenses serve as the main messaging service that implements communications, mapping, message delivery, data transformation, and routing of data to and from the Philips products to external systems. IntelliBridge Enterprise has no clinical user interface, nor does it interpret, inspect, or provide additional analytical functionality for medical device data.\nWorkflows affected:\nIntelliBridge Enterprise system integration with,\n\nSureSigns (VS4)\nEarlyVue (VS30)\nIntelliVue Guardian (IGS) \u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INSERTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION INTO LOG FILE CWE-532\nUnencrypted user credentials received in the IntelliBridge Enterprise (IBE) are logged within the transaction logs, which are secured behind the login based administrative web portal.\nThe unencrypted user credentials sent from the affected products listed above, for the purpose of handshake or authentication with the\nEnterprise Systems, are logged as the payload in IntelliBridge Enterprise (IBE) within the transaction logs. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability to read plain text credentials from log files.\nCVE-2020-12023 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Netherlands\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nCustomer Indiana University Health reported this vulnerability to Philips.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nPhilips plans a new release (IBE B.13) by the end of Q4 2020 that remediates the security risk by not logging the plain text user credentials in the log file.\nAs an interim mitigation to this vulnerability, Philips recommends the following:\n\nThe IBE transaction logs are only accessible with administrative privileges. An additional account can be created on the IBE system with limited privileges, for service engineers.\nReduce log retention to an acceptable timeframe that allows for recovery activities.\n\nUsers with questions regarding their specific Philips IntelliBridge Enterprise installation should contact their local Philips service support team, or regional service support.\nUsers can see the Philips\u00a0advisory for more details, and contact the Philips Customer Service Solutions team for additional guidance. Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products.\u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nRestrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.\nApply defense-in-depth strategies.\nDisable unnecessary accounts and services.\nWhere additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.\n",
