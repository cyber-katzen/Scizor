MITIGATIONS--------------- Philips plans a new release to remediate these vulnerabilities by October 2022\\. As an interim mitigation to these vulnerabilities, Philips recommends the following:* Users should operate all Philips deployed and supported products within Philips authorized specifications, including physical and logical controls. Only allowed personnel are permitted in the vicinity of the product. Refer to the Philips instructions for use (IFU) available on [InCenter](https://incenter.medical.philips.com/)  . Users with questions about their specific MRI product should contact a Philips service support team or regional service support. Philips contact information is available at the [Philips customer service solutions website](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions)  or by calling 1\\-800\\-722\\-9377\\. For more information regarding these vulnerabilities, see the [Philips product security advisory](http://www.philips.com/productsecurity)  website. Users can also visit the [Philips product security website](https://www.philips.com/productsecurity)  for the latest security information for Philips products. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:* Implement physical security measures to limit or control access to critical systems.* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.* Apply defense\\-in\\-depth strategies.* Disable unnecessary accounts and services.* Where additional information is needed, refer to existing [cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm)  . CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
