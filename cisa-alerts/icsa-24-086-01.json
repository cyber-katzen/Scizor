EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: AutomationDirect\nEquipment: C-MORE EA9 HMI\nVulnerabilities: Path Traversal, Stack-Based Buffer Overflow, Plaintext Storage of a Password\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to exploit a remote device and inject malicious code on the panel.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following versions of C-MORE EA9 HMI, a display system used for interfacing with controllers, are affected:\n\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T6CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T7CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA0-T7CL-R: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T8CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T10CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T10WCL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T12CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T15CL: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-T15CL-R: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-RHMI: Version 6.77 and prior\nC-MORE EA9 HMI EA9-PGMSW: Version 6.77 and prior\n\n3.2 Vulnerability Overview\n3.2.1\u00a0Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE-22\nThere is a function in Automation-Direct C-MORE EA9 HMI that allows an attacker to send a relative path in the URL without proper sanitizing of the content.\nCVE-2024-25136\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\nCVE-2024-25136\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v4 base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.2\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow CWE-121\nIn Automation-Direct C-MORE EA9 HMI there is a program that copies a buffer of a size controlled by the user into a limited sized buffer on the stack which leads to a stack overflow. The result of this stack-based buffer overflow will lead to a denial-of-service conditions.\nCVE-2024-25137\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)\nCVE-2024-25137\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v4 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.2.3\u00a0Plaintext Storage of a Password CWE-256\nIn Automation-Direct C-MORE EA9 HMI credentials used by the platform are stored as plain text on the device.\nCVE-2024-25138\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)\nCVE-2024-25138\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v4 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nTomer Goldschmidt of Claroty Research - Team82 reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nAutomationDirect recommends that users update C-MORE EA9 HMI to\u00a0V6.78.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are\u00a0not accessible from the internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage on\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nCISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for\u00a0proactive defense of ICS assets.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\n5.
