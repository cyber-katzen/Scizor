MITIGATIONS--------------- Schneider Electric has provided a new version of the IGSS Definition module to address these vulnerabilities. Users are recommended to update to [IGSS Version 14\\.0\\.0\\.20248](https://igss.schneider-electric.com/igss/igssupdates/v140/IGSSUPDATE.ZIP)  Alternatively, the following workarounds and mitigations can be applied to reduce risk:* Avoid importing CGF files from untrusted sources* Users should also consider upgrading to the latest product offering [IGSS v15](https://igss.schneider-electric.com/licensed-versions/)  to resolve this issue. For more information, see Schneider Electric security notification [SEVD\\-2020\\-315\\-03](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-03/)  CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf)  for more information on avoiding email scams.* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)  for more information on social engineering attacks. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices)  on the ICS webpage on [us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  . Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us\\-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics)  in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
