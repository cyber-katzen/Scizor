EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.5\nATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity\nVendor: Siemens\n\n--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 3 ---------\n\nEquipment: Capital VSTAR, Nucleus NET, Nucleus ReadyStart v3, Nucleus ReadyStart v4, Nucleus Source Code\n\n--------- End Update A Part 1 of 3 ---------\n\nVulnerabilities: Infinite Loop\n\n2. UPDATE INFORMATION\nThis updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-103-05 Siemens Nucleus Products IPv6 Stack that was published April 13, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.\n3. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial-of-service condition.\n4. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following Nucleus products are affected:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 3 ---------\n\nCapital VSTAR: Versions including the affected IPv6 stack\nNucleus NET: All versions\nNucleus ReadyStart v3: All versions prior to v2017.02.4\nNucleus ReadyStart v4: All versions prior to v4.1.0\nNucleus Source Code: Versions including the affected IPv6 stack\n\n--------- End Update A Part 2 of 3 ---------\n4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n4.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835\nThe function that processes IPv6 headers does not check the lengths of extension header options, allowing attackers to put this function into an infinite loop with crafted length values.\nCVE-2021-25663 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.2.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835\nThe function that processes the hop-by-hop extension header in IPv6 packets and its options lacks any checks against the length field of the header, allowing attackers to put the function into an infinite loop by supplying arbitrary length values.\nCVE-2021-25664 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n4.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany\n\n4.4 RESEARCHER\nSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.\n5. MITIGATIONS\nSiemens has published security advisory SSA-248289 and released the following mitigations for the affected products:\n--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\n\nCapital VSTAR: Contact customer support to receive patch and update information.\nNucleus NET: Update to the latest versions of Nucleus ReadyStart v3 or v4. Users may also contact customer support or the local Nucleus Sales team for mitigation advice.\nNucleus ReadyStart v3: Update to v2017.02.4 or later version\nNucleus ReadyStart v4: Update to v4.1.0 or later version\nNucleus Source Code: Contact customer support to receive patch and update information.\n\n--------- End Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------\nSiemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:\n\nFor additional mitigation advice contact customer support or the Nucleus Sales team.\n\nAs a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens\u2019 Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.\n\nAdditional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity\nFor further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens\u2019 products and solutions, contact Siemens ProductCERT.\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on\u00a0us-cert.cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\n\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.\n",
