EXECUTIVE SUMMARY---------------------* **CVSS v3 7\\.8*** **ATTENTION:**  Low attack complexity* **Vendor:**  GE Digital* **Equipment:**  iFIX* **Vulnerability:**  Code Injection2\\. RISK EVALUATION------------------- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for privilege escalation and full control of the system.3\\. TECHNICAL DETAILS---------------------### 3\\.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following components of iFIX, a human machine interface (HMI) supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software, are affected:* GE Digital Proficy iFIX 2022* GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6\\.1* GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6\\.5### 3\\.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW**3\\.2\\.1 [IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE\\-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)** GE Digital Proficy iFIX 2022, GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6\\.1, and GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6\\.5 are vulnerable to code injection, which may allow an attacker to insert malicious configuration files in the expected web server execution path and gain full control of the HMI software.[CVE\\-2023\\-0598](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-0598)  has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7\\.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  ).### 3\\.3 BACKGROUND* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:**  Multiple* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:**  Worldwide* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:**  United States### 3\\.4 RESEARCHER Michael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.4\\. MITIGATIONS--------------- GE Digital recommends that users upgrade to Proficy iFIX 2023\\. GE Digital recommends that any users choosing not to upgrade at this time apply the Simulation Drivers (SIMs) provided below to their earlier GE Digital Proficy iFIX versions (login required):* iFIX 2023 \\- select \u201cDownload Software Updates\u201d:\t+ [iFIX 2022 SIM](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/s/article/iFIX2022-WebSecurity-001?language=en_US)\t+ [iFIX v6\\.1 SIM](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/s/article/iFIX61-WebSecurity-001?language=en_US)\t+ [iFIX v6\\.5 SIM](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/s/article/iFIX65-WebSecurity-001?language=en_US) Also, users are strongly advised to refer to the Secure Deployment Guide (SDG) instructions on how to set\\-up and configure Access Control List (ACLs). The complete SDG can be found [here](https://digitalsupport.ge.com/s/article/iFIX-Secure-Deployment-Guide?language=en_US)  . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)  .* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs)\t+ Note: VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. A VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)  on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense\\-in\\-Depth Strategies.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)  Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics)  in the technical information paper, [ICS\\-TIP\\-12\\-146\\-01B\\-\\-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B)  . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
