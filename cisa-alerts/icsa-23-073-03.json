EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCVSS v3 7.8\nATTENTION:\u00a0Low attack complexity\u00a0\nVendor:\u00a0GE Digital\u00a0\nEquipment:\u00a0iFIX\u00a0\nVulnerability:\u00a0Code Injection\u00a0\n\n2. RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for privilege escalation and full control of the system.\u00a0\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following components of iFIX, a human machine interface (HMI) supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software, are affected:\u00a0\n\nGE Digital Proficy iFIX 2022\u00a0\nGE Digital Proficy iFIX v6.1\u00a0\nGE Digital Proficy iFIX v6.5\u00a0\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94\nGE Digital Proficy iFIX 2022, GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6.1, and GE Digital Proficy iFIX v6.5 are vulnerable to code injection, which may allow an attacker to insert malicious configuration files in the expected web server execution path and gain full control of the HMI software.\u00a0\nCVE-2023-0598\u00a0has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\u00a0\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:\u00a0Multiple\u00a0\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:\u00a0Worldwide\u00a0\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:\u00a0United States\u00a0\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nMichael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.\u00a0\n4. MITIGATIONS\nGE Digital recommends that users upgrade to Proficy iFIX 2023. GE Digital recommends that any users choosing not to upgrade at this time apply the Simulation Drivers (SIMs) provided below to their earlier GE Digital Proficy iFIX versions (login required):\u00a0\n\niFIX 2023 - select \u201cDownload Software Updates\u201d:\u00a0\n\niFIX 2022 SIM\u00a0\u00a0\niFIX v6.1 SIM\u00a0\u00a0\niFIX v6.5 SIM\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso, users are strongly advised to refer to the Secure Deployment Guide (SDG) instructions on how to set-up and configure Access Control List (ACLs). The complete SDG can be found\u00a0here. \u00a0\nCISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are\u00a0not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs)\u00a0\n\nNote: VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. A VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for\u00a0control systems security recommended practices\u00a0on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including\u00a0Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at\u00a0cisa.gov/ics\u00a0in the technical information paper,\u00a0ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
