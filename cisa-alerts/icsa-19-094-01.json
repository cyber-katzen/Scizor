RISK EVALUATION\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code under the privileges of the application.\n3. TECHNICAL DETAILS\n3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS\nThe following version of CX-Programmer within CX-One is affected:\n\nCX-Programmer v9.70 and prior\nCommon Components January 2019 and prior\n\n3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n3.2.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0USE AFTER FREE CWE-416\nWhen processing project files, the application fails to check if it is referencing freed memory. An attacker could use a specially crafted project file to exploit and execute code under the privileges of the application.\nCVE-2019-6556 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).\n3.3 BACKGROUND\n\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Critical Manufacturing\nCOUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide\nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Japan\n\n3.4 RESEARCHER\nEsteban Ruiz (mr_me) of Source Incite, working with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.\n4. MITIGATIONS\nOmron has released an updated version of CX-One to address the vulnerability. This release is available through the CX-One auto-update service.\n\nCX-Programmer Version 9.71\nCommon Components April 2019\n\nNCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:\n\nDo not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.\nRefer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.\nRefer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.\n\nNCCIC also recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\n\nNCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.NCCIC also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS-CERT website in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.\nNo known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.\n",
