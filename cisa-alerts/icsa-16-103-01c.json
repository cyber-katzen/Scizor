ICS\\-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------\n\n\n\n Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.\n \n\n\n\n Siemens ROX\\-based devices are used to connect devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets. RUGGEDCOM APE is a utility\\-grade computing platform that plugs directly into any member of the RUGGEDCOM RX1500 family and makes it possible to run third\\-party software applications without an external industrial PC. SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks allowing users to manage and maintain tunnel connections (VPN) between networks, machines, and sites. SCALANCE security modules provide filtering of incoming and outgoing network connections with stateful packet inspection.\n \n\n\n\n According to Siemens, the affected devices are deployed across several sectors including Chemical, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Healthcare and Public Health, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.\n \n\n\nVULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION\n------------------------------\n\n\n### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW\n\n\n\n### IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFERCWE\\-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119\\.html, web site last accessed April 12, 2016\\.\n\n\n\n\n There is a stack\\-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the glibc library\u2019s DNS client side resolver.\n \n\n\n\n CVE\\-2015\\-7547NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\\=CVE\\-2015\\-7547, web site last accessed April 12, 2016\\. has been assigned to this vulnerability.
