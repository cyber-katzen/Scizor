In June 2015, the \nUnited States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) suffered  a data breach o f \npersonnel records , including users with access to the nations most critical systems . The \nbreach occurred b y leveraging  compromised credentials. The agency had multifactor \nauthentication in place, but it was not fully implemented until it was too lat e to prevent \nthe earlier initial breach . On May 6, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, a major Southeast oil \npipeline system , suffered a major ransomware cyberattack that caused financial and \nsupply  chain havoc across the United States , impacting economic stability . The attack \nexploited a legacy Virtual Private Network (VPN) system without multifactor \nauthentication in place. Attackers were able to gain access into the system by \ncompromising a complex password.  These are just two of the many examples of \npublicly  known cybersecurity incidents that exploit immature ICAM capabilities that are \ncovered by  the user pillar  of the ZT f ramework . With similar exploits on the rise, it is \ncrucial for organizations to adopt a mature Zero Trust (ZT) approach to defend critical \nnational security systems  (NSS) and other  United States Government (USG) and \nprivate sector critical IT resources.  [2] [3] [4] [5] \nThis CSI details increasingly mature capabilities in the user pillar , including \nrecommendations and examples for achieving these maturity levels . The user (or \nidentity) pillar highlights capabilities to establish the foundational authoritative identities \nof a system . Further, it describe s the characteristics of authentication and authorization \ndecisions.  The user pillar maturity mod el builds on and matures the controls of the \nFederal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)  architecture . FICAM \nestablishes five core user service practice areas: Identity Management, Credential \nManagement, Access Management, Federation and Go vernance. [6] FICAM is the \nfederal governments enterprise approach to design, plan, and execute common \nIdentity, Credential, and Access Management  (ICAM ) processes. The FICAM \nframework was established  in 2009 to provide a common ICAM segment architecture \nfor federal agencies  to use in ICAM program  and solution roadmap planning. The \nFICAM  capabilities, e xpanded and refined by ZT principles, create a solid foundation for \nNSS owners and operators alike. They outline ways  to take  concrete steps to mature ZT \nsecurity practices relating to identity management, access security controls , and the \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n3 operational practices related to establishing identities for users  and strong mechanisms \nfor authenticating and authorizing  users  access  to critical resources.  \nAudience  \nThis CSI provides guidance primarily intended for NSS owners and operators, but may \nbe useful for owners and operators of other systems that might  be targeted by \nsophisticated malicious actors. Guidance for other system owners and operators is also \navailable via National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , [3] and \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ). [4] This guidance is \ncompatible with  Department of Defense (D oD) Zero Trust g uidance [5] referenced at the \nend of this document.  \nBackground  \nThe Presidents Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity  (EO 14028) \nand National  Security Memorandum 8  (NSM -8) direct  the Federal Civilian Executive \nBranch (FCEB) agencies and NSS owners and operators to develop plans to  adopt a \nZT cybersecurity framework . [7] [8] \nIn the NSA cybersecurity information sheet (CSI)  Embracing a Zero Trust Security \nModel , the concept of ZT  is defined  and its seven pillars  are identified . ZT \nimplementation efforts are intended to continually matur e cybersecurity protection s, \nresponse s, and operations over time. Progression of capabilities in each of the seven \npillars should be seen as a cycle of continuous improvement based on evaluation and \nmonitoring of threats.  [2] \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n4 Figure 1: Description of the  seven (7) p illars of Zero Trust  \nFigure 1  depicts the ZT pillars , includ ing the user pillar. The capabilities and milestones \nfor the user pillar component of the ZT maturity model  will be described in detail \nthroughout this document. The p illars are not independent ; many capabilities in the user \npillar depend on, or align with capabili ties in other pillars as indicated .  \nThe user pillar, which focus es on managing user access in a  dynamic risk environment , \ndepends on capabilities that will be the focus of other pillars . Based on  the needed \ndecision making speed  and the  amount of information that must be monitored, \nautomation ( part of the automation and orchestration  pillar) may be necessary for a \nmature implementation.  Continuous auditing (part of the v isibility and analytics  pillar ) \nprovides accountability for accesses , and can be used to ana lyze risk associate with a \nparticular request . Network, data, and application segregation (part of the \nnetwork/environment, data, and workstation applications  pillar ) impact the credentials \nassociated with user accesses, and risk -based access controls also depend on the \ncapabilities of different devices (part of the device pillar ). \n\n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n5 User Pillar  \nThe user pillar expands and refines the capabilities associated with FICAM framework \nto address the enhanced threat to identity, credentials , and access management . This \nCSI identifies these capabilities and aligns them to Zero Trust maturity levels for the \nuser p illar. The FICAM Framework and user pillar capabilities  include : \n Identity Management : technical systems, policies , and processes that \ncreate, define, govern , and synchronize the ownership, utilization , and \nsafeguarding of identity information to associate digital identities to an \nindividual  or logical entity.  \n Credential management : technical systems, policies , and pro cesses that \nestablish and maintain a binding of an identity to an individual, physical , or \nlogical entity, to include establishing the need for a credential, enrolling an \nentity, establishing and issuing the credential, and maintaining the credential \nthrou ghout its life cycle.   \n Access Management : management and control of the mechanisms used to \ngrant or deny entities access to resources , including  assurances that entities \nare properly validated, that entities are authorized to access the resources , \nthat resources are protected from unauthorized creation, modification , or \ndeletion, and that authorized entities are accountable for their activity.  \n Federation : interope rability  of ICAM  with mission partners. This CSI only \ndiscusses the general complexity  of iden tity federation.   \n Governance : continuou s improvement of systems and processes to assess \nand reduce risk associated with ICAM capabilities . This CSI addresses \nimprovement s for this category by defining maturity levels for each of the \nICAM  categories rather than discussing maturity of identity governance in \ngeneral.  \nThese c apabilities  provide  a starting point for a user pillar m aturity model . A generic \nassessment of current capabilities for NSS and employee access to U.S. Government \nsystems  in these areas is  included in the ZT  preparation phase . These foundational \ncapabilities are recommended for other high value systems in preparation for their ZT \nmigration.  As additional capabilities are deployed, enterprises advance through the \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n6 basic, int ermediate , and advanced maturity  phases  and are more able to operate \naccording to ZT principles .  \nFigure 2: Zero Trust user pillar maturity  \nIdentity Management   \nIdentity m anagement includes the processes and procedures to  collect, verif y, and \nmanag e attributes to establish and maintain enterprise identities for users . Robust \nidentity m anagement  requires  a comprehensive approach for proving that people and \nsystems are who they say they are . This means  establishing authorita tive processes \nand sources for digital identities (and assoc iated attributes)  to verify a users identity . \nIdentity management encompasses the human resources , security, and technical \nsystems and processes used to establish authoritative identities. Identi ty management \nbegins with establishing a current and accurate inventory of all users, including person  \nand non-person entities , ensuring those  with access to critical resour ces are vetted and \nregistered. The i nventory includes identity attributes required by FICAM identity \ngovernance practices.  \nIdentity Management  Capabilities  \n Inventory users (including privileged users)   Identify all users with \naccess to critical resources and review their privileges. Reduce the risk of \nuntrusted users with access to reso urces by removing users who no longer \nhave a need for access.  \n\n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n7  Utiliz e standard, centralized identity stores   Only use trusted, \nstandardized inventories. Make them centrally accessible and usable so \nunsynchronized, out -of-date, or contradictory identity i nformation is not used.   \nMaturity phases  \n Preparation for ZT : FICAM requirements focus on person -entities. Enterprise \nrepositories maintain entities for individuals. Enterprise identity vetting for \npersons and non-person entities ( NPE) sponsors are in -person using \nmethods commensurate with NIST FIPS 201 . [9] Identity mana gement for  \nNPEs, however , is locally defined using ad -hoc procedures and local \nsystems . Significant numbers of individuals  who cannot use enterprise \nidentity management systems are only registered locally .  \nTo prepare for more mature phases, organizations should ensure all users  \nare registered and user information is accurate. Organizations should begin to \nstandardize processes to identify and maintain records for NPE and other \nlocally registered users . \n Basic  ZT maturity : enterprise attribute  standards are defined , and all local \nattributes are documented.  All user  attribute  claims are validated during \nenterprise identity vetting or via approved remote vetting methods . All \nstandard attributes can be integrated directly into access control mechanisms.  \n Intermediate ZT maturity : enterprise user attributes are standardized for use \nin access mechanisms  and authoritative sources are identified for each \nattribute. System owners can define additional user attributes as  necessary to \nmanage  access to highly sensitive information , and processes to issue these \nattributes are standardized . Enterprise and locally defined attributes can be  \ndirectly integrated into access control mechanisms.   \n Advanced ZT maturity : Risk-based attributes are defined  and standardized  \nto alert resource managers of risk indicators associated with (NPE or person) \nentities. A uthoritative sources for risk -based attributes have access to \nrequired system activity logs  and are able to assess the associated risk and \nassert  user values in support of risk -based responses . Note that risk -based \nresponses can be manual or automated, to include  enhanced monitoring, out -\nof-band investigation, conditional  approval, or in extreme  cases, denial of \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n8 access , and the response s may be  resource  specific . All user attributes \nrelevant to a resource are integrated directly into the access mechanisms  for \nthat resource . \nFigure 3: Zero Trust identity management maturity   \nCredential Management   \nCredential Management includes  issuance , usage , and revocation of credentials bound \nto enterprise identities.  Once identities are established, they must be issued secure \ncredentials to prove to systems  they are who they say they are.  Each identity may be \nassociated with multiple credentials, depending on the different roles or personas the \nentity may perform for the organization. It is strongly recommended that highly \nprivileged users have separate credentials for their privileged and non -privileged roles.  \nEach stage in the credential lifecycle   establishing, issuing, maintaining, and revoking \ncredentials   is managed to ensure digital credentials are clearly bound to the physical \nor logical entity described by the identifier.  Note that assertions made by single  sign-on \nor identity federation servers , such as Kerberos or Active Directory , are also referred to \nas credentials. Here the logon and remote authentication credentials are distinguished \nfrom assertions made by single -sign-on or federation servers. T he latter are covered \nunder access management and federation capabilities.  \n\n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n9 Credential Management  Capabilities  \nCredential management capabilities are well established for public -key credentials and \nare captured in certificate policies and various Federal, DoD, and NSS policy \ndocuments. They are less mature in use cases where alternate credentials are used. \nCredential management generally includes documenting the need for a credential, \nassociating the entity with verified identity information, generation and  issuance of the \ncredential to the entity, and maintenance of the credential over its lifecycle, to include \nrevocation, re -issuance or replacement, re -enrollment, and expiration . The systems, \nprocesses , and procedures for credential management are specific  to the type of \ncredential. NIST S pecial Publication (SP)  800-63 provides guidance for credentials used \nin federal systems. [10] Zero T rust principles depend on protecting access to resources \nusing strong credentials.  \nMulti -factor a uthentication (MFA) is based on at least two  of the three types of \nauthentication factors : something you know, something yo u have, and som ething you \nare. The strength of authentication systems is described in NISTs SP 800 -63 part B in \nterms of authenticator assurance levels (AAL) ranging from AAL 1 to AAL 3 . Strongly \nassured methods are recommended for all person users  with access to critic al \nresources . NSA recommends strong m ulti-factor authentication for person  users.   \nThere are multiple authenticator  methods that can be used individually or in combination \nto achieve the desired AAL . Software options include applications that generate time -\nbased authentication codes or out-of-band prompt s to authorize a login attempt.  Some \ndevices  allow for leveraging a hardware root of trust on a computer or smartphone  to \nenhance protection of secret  or private keys used by software  authenticator s. Multi -\nfactor hardware devices require activation using one or more factor s (PIN alone, or \nsupplemented with a biometric) and provide a one -time password or cryptographic \nauthenticator . [11] Hardware one-time password devices can display a one -time \npassword for user entry, isolating the users private information from network access, or \ncan connect dir ectly to the users device via a controlled interface . Certain c ryptographic \nauthenticators , known as phishing -resistant MFA , can provide phishing resistance by \nestablishing  a cryptographically verifiable connection between the users device and the \nserver.  [12]  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n10 Compliance with EO 14028 require s MFA techniques  for all users . Organizations  should \nselect  strong MFA products that are validated to meet the desired AAL . Multifactor \ncryptographic device authenticators , like the common access card (CAC) and personal \nidentity verification (PIV) card , as well as multifactor hardware tokens implementing \nFIDO2 mechanisms , are the most robust mechanisms commercially available , providing \nAAL 3 with phishing resis tance .  \nFor detailed  MFA guidance, read more in Transition to Multifactor Authentication  [11] \nand Selecting Secure Multi -factor Authentication Solutions . [13] \nNon-person entity  authenticators  should be protected via hardware -based \nmechanisms . An NPE would  ideally  be represented by a public k ey certificate whose \nassociated private key is under the strict control of the entity  it represents, whether that \nentity is a physical device , a process , or other logical entity . Those entities that do not \nsupport public key authentication typically use pa sswords. Any such entities should use \nlong, randomly generated passwords, stored as necessary in a hardware -protected \npassword vault  or isolated environment . All default passwords must be changed and \nsystem accounts that are not necessary should be disable d.  \nNPEs that support public -key credentials  are sponsored and managed by authorized \nindividuals who are responsible for ensuring the entity is accurately identified , either  in a \npublic -key certificate  or in account records . The sponsor is also responsible for installing \nthe private key associated with the credential to ensure it is protected from potential \ncompromise, and prompt reporting of any suspected compromise. Hardware root-of-\ntrust using trusted platform  modules and  execution isolation techniques are \nrecommended to provide assurance that only the aut horized entity associated with the \ncredential has access to the private key.  \nEach authenticator must be managed by and only issued to authorized and vetted \nidentities. Person users are  responsible for reporting if their authenticator is no longer in \ntheir control (lost or compromised)  or no longer needed. Sponsors for NPE entities are \nresponsible for requesting revocation of a credential if the entity associated with the \ncredential is compromised,  or no longer active. All relying parties will need to be \ninformed and disassociate the authenticator from user accounts or privileges in a timely \nmanner when a credential is so reported. Users with multiple authenticators can \nleverage an enterprise lifecycle management system associated with one of the \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n11 authenticators, using methods described in NISTs Derived PIV guidance . [14] \nOf special concern is the use of cryptographically obsolete methods. An enterprise must \nbe able to replace user credentials if the methods used become obsolete. Without \nproper planning, this could have significant  disruptive impacts to the enterprise. Even \nwith careful planning, it is possible that a particular authentication method becomes \nweak. Enterprises should be able to respond to such a discovery by rapidly revoking \nobsolete or compromised mechanisms and dep loying new credentials using secure \nmethods, potentially to large numbers of users in a short period of time.  \n Issue authorized strong credentials   according  to each users \nrole/persona.  \n Inventory the type of credentials  users utilize to log in for each a ccount  \n each credential is associated with the entity representing a persona and \neach persona is associated to the unique person. Each NPE credential is \nassociated with the logical entity or to the process(es) and device(s) that can \nact as the logical entity , and to its sponsor.  \n Establish infrastructure, tools , and processes to enable reporting and \ndissemination of credential status information   establish  efficient \nprocesses and procedures to revoke all credentials associated with each \nuser. For people  users, establish efficient processes and procedures to \nrevoke all credentials associated with a user device protecting software \ncredentials, and to revoke all credentials associated with a hardware \nmultifactor authenticator device. For NPE users, establis h efficient processes \nand procedures to revoke all credentials associated with a sponsor, with a \ndevice, or associated with software or operating systems that can be \ncompromised.  \nMaturity phases  \n Preparation for ZT : FICAM requires person users to be assigned credentials \nissued by an enterprise -approved P ublic Key Infrastructure (P KI). Approved \ncertificate policies governing such PKI include  issuance during face -to-face \ninteractions between the user or sponsor and an  authorized registration \nofficer or trusted agent, as well as efficient reporting and revocation  \nprocesses. Users in defined exceptional use  cases may use alternative MFA \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n12 credentials. To prepare for higher maturity levels, inventory all credentials \nassocia ted with each user.  \n Basic ZT maturity : All users, including those in authorized exceptional use  \ncases, use enterprise -approved , highly assured  authenticators that are \ncompliant with NIST SP 800-63 guidance, where the credential lifecycle is \nmanaged using defined methods  or via association with enterprise PKI \ncredentials.  \n Intermediate ZT maturity : Enterprises have established plans to update user \ncredentials to ensure authenticators are compliant with NSS stan dards within \nthe stated timelines  (e.g., in accordance with NSM -10 [15] and CNSS P 15 \n[16]). All credentials are independently managed throughout their lifecycle \nand can be  revoked rapidly in response to notification of compromise of the \nuser, the users device, or processes on the users device . \n Advanced ZT maturity : Enterprise s have established and effective \nprocesses and procedures to rapidly revoke and replace credentia ls when \nneeded, including unanticipated compromise of cryptographic  \nimplementations. Authoritative sources of risk -based attributes can interface \ndirectly with credential revocation systems.  \nFigure 4: Zero Trust credential manageme nt maturity   \n\n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n13 Access Management  \nAccess m anagement includes management of the policies and mechanisms that ensure \nonly authenticated users authorized for access to protected resources are able to gain \naccess . FICAM recommendations include having mechanisms that ensure entities \naccessing resources are authenticated and authorized and held accountable for their \nactivities, that provide confidentiality to protected resources, that preserve resource \nintegrity, and that enable resources to be  reliably available a nd properly maintained.  \nAccess control frameworks provide access decisions at various levels of granularity , \nwith mechanisms that support granular access rules generally representing a higher \nlevel of maturity.  The recommendations here are stated in terms of an attribute -based \naccess control model (ABAC). There are many ways of implementing these access \ncontrols, to include layered mechanisms that each consider differ ent aspects of an \naccess policy  (See NIST  SP 800-162 Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) \nDefinitions and Considerations ). [17] Many  implementations utilize single sign-on \nmechanisms that v alidate the users credentials, verify attributes assigned to the \nauthenticated identity, and issue access assertions to resources regarding the privileges \nconveyed in those attributes. These mechanisms tend to use broad, static, role -based \naccess rules go verning access to all resources on a system. Mechanisms to enforce \ndynamic, granular accesses to critical resources can be used directly, or as a \nsupplement to these systems to achieve a balance of granularity and practicality.  \nAccess control  mechanisms  should consider granular ity, reliability, availability , and the \npotential risks to the resource . Attribute -based access control (ABAC) models provide \nthe flexibility required to meet these goals. Assess the features of available access \ncontrol systems aga inst the ABAC model and consider enhancements to facilitate the \ndesired features. Automated access denial decisions in response to probabilistic \nindicators ( e.g., provided by behavior analytics) ha ve the potential to disrupt mission  \nand should be used spar ingly.  However, strong indicators of an active threat should be \nacted on quickly to minimize loss.  \nTo determine what user and resource attributes are required for a given enterprise \nrequires a comprehensive inventory and characterization of users , resource s, and the \nusers  ability to protect the data. At a minimum, mandatory access controls required by \nlaw should be supported by access mechanisms that are able to process dynamic \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n14 resour ce and user attributes for each access request. For National Security Sys tems, \nsuch attributes include classification , clearance , releasability , and citizenship attributes , \nalong with  community  of interest restrictions and membership attributes . Additional role-\nbased and need -to-know attributes  specific to each sensitive resour ce are \nrecommended . Attribute based mechanism s require  an authoritative source for \nattributes and processes for users to be provisioned  with attributes . In addition , \nresources need to be labeled with enterprise labels, and digital policies need to be \nestab lished that reflect the access policies depending on the attributes .  \nAccess Management Capabilities  \n Minimize privileges to specific roles necessary to accomplish mission \nfunctions   Perform regular periodic reviews to remove unnecessary \nprivileges. Automate removal of privileges (or attributes) based on lifecycle \nevents (retirement/removal, change of position, etc.)  \n Least Privilege  implementing  least privilege  access policies minimize s the \ndamage a malicious actor can cause if they gain access to a  limited set of \ncredentials . It also limits the damage a user can cause through neglect, an \naccident , or malicious intent. Least privilege is m ost important for  access to \nhighly privileged functions, such as ente rprise or domain administration.  Least \nprivilege concepts ensure that users can access the information they need \nwhile limiting gratuitous access. Current recommendations for  highly \nprivileged users  include  isolation  using separate devices, credentials , and \naccounts that are tailored to the highly  privileged functions, but also isolated \nfrom high -risk activities . Current recommendations also include consideration \nof specialized tools that enforce role separations and workflow restrictions  for \nhighly privileged users .  \n Just in Time (JIT) / Just Enou gh Access (JEA)  in addition to granular \naccess rules, just in time / just enough access policies are a type of least  \nprivilege access that grants privileges to controlled resources only for \npredetermined periods of time on an as -needed basis.  Access policies that \napply  JIT/JEA to highly sensitive resources, including highly privileged \nmanagement functions  or roles that  govern ICAM functions, are \nrecommended as highly effective at reducing abuses and containing  \nadversary access.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n15  Privileged Acce ss Management (PAM) T ools  privilege d access \nmanagement (PAM) tools provide a centralized management interface for \nassigning fine-grained privileges based on risk exposure and least privilege \naccess, only allowing as much access as required . PAM tools can also proxy \nprivileged user access to resources (especially administrative functions) that \ndo not support verification of strong authenticators, support workflow \nconstraints , and enforce role separation. Privileged accounts and services \nmust be controlled because threat actors continue to target administrator \ncredentials for access to high-value assets and to move la terally through the \nnetwork.  As with other policy enforcement mechanisms, PAM \nimplementation s should be  tightly controlled and monitored , since  they control \nthe highly privileged functions that shape the environment, making them  an \nattractive target, as many incident response operations have revealed . \n Privileged Access Devices  providing a designated and dedicated device, \nsometimes called privileged access workstations,  for all administration \nfunctions and accounts further supports isolation from unauthorized \ndisclosure or unauthorized use of privileged accounts.  This can be via a \nvirtual workstatio n or a physical workstation. It i s importa nt that administrative \nworkstation s only have access to essential applications required to perform \nadministrative actions and do not allow high -risk activities, such as email or \nweb browsing . \n Fine-grained, r isk adaptive access policies   a risk adaptive access \nframework  ensures that organizations can balance reliability, availability , and \nmission performance  against adversary threats . Access policies that include  \nfine-grained access decisions are better s uited to address threats while \nmaintaining mission cr itical operations . In general, resources should be \ncategorized using enterprise attributes that correlate to organizational mission \nsensitivities and security needs. To protect resources from adversary \ncompromise, controls must be manageable , used, and enf orced .  \nMaturity phases  \n Preparation for ZT : Access control mechanisms are largely identity based, \nwith manually managed groups and roles , and separate  access control lists  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n16 must be maintained on disparate systems that support a variety  of access \nmethods . Some administrative accesses are segregated onto subnets and \nsome highly privileged users may have separate administrator credentials. To \nprepare to mature these practices, i nventory  user entitlements  and access \npolicies , and understand the user and reso urce attributes  that are implicit in \nthose policies and entitlements. Remove entitlements that are outdated, \ninappropriate for the users role, or no longer needed for mission. Identify  \nthose attributes w hich could be used directly in an attribute -based me chanism \nand determine if enterprise managed attributes can be used or whether \nlocally defined attributes are appropriate. Applications that depend only on \nlegacy account management mechanisms  are identified and updated to use \nmodern methods, allowing the w eak legacy mechanisms to be disabled . \n Basic ZT maturity : Review current access policies against least  privilege \nprinciples. Implement PAM for all users having access to highly privileged \nfunctions , especially for management of resources that do not support  \nverification of strong authenticators . Identify authoritative sources for user \nattributes and implement data tagging for all critical resources  to support \nmore granular access models . Ensure accesses  are logged to support \nforensics.  Authentication asserti ons are limited in time and scope.  \n Intermediate ZT maturity : Refine d access policies enable segregation of \nresources. Access to highly privileged functions are segregated both logically \nand chronologically,  using  dedicated workstations  and PAM tools  that support \nJIT/JEA policies. Access p olicies begin to reflect the strength of \nauthentication by minimizing  access for weaker authentication methods (e.g.,  \npasswords .) Further  they distinguish  access for users of alternative MFA to \nspecific instances  that require them. General users have limited access \nbased on the totality of attributes relevant to the access policy . Specific ally, to \nthe requested resource, which mean they are  re-authenticated and re -\nvalidated for ac cess to different resources  as wor k responsibilities change . \nAccess decisions depend on both the user requesting access and the \ndevice /systems  used to make the request.  Single sign-on assertions are time -\nbound and specific to classes of resources having identical access rules or  \nare supple mented with dynamic attribute -based access rules.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n17  Advanced ZT maturity : User accesses are granular to the specific resource \nbeing requested, considering the user and their device, as well as the \nsensitivity of the application and specific data  associated with the request. \nPerson and NPE user attributes include risk -based indicators provided by \nauthoritative  sources . Access policies for sensitive  resources are able to use  \nrisk-based attributes of the user and device to minimize risk.  User activity \ninformati on is assessed against user roles and behavior patterns to identify \nincreased risk. Appropriate risk responses are triggered (via manual or \nautomated processes) based on risk attributes. Analytic capabilities that \nsupport user risk -based attributes , such a s continuous authentication , can be \nused to trigger re -authentication or other responses to determine potential \ncompromise of user credentials.  \nFigure 5: Zero Trust access management maturity   \nIdentity Federation   \nIdentity federation includes the  technology, policies, standards , and processes that \nallow an agency to accept digital identities, attributes , and credentials manage d by \npartners to securely share information  in accordance with the access policies of multiple \npartne rs. Often, partners will have identity, credential , and access management \nimplementations of varying maturity, and will almost certainly have distinct \nimplementations that complicate sharing.

Further,  they include \nestablishing confidence in each partners iden tity/credential management  credential \nmanagement practices, and addressing validation requirements for different \nauthenticators . Also, mapping authentication assertions from multiple sources, sharing \nand aligning the attributes issued by each partner, and reconciling access policy \ndifferences  are key FICAM requirements needed for mature ZT approaches . In addition \nto high -level agreements about sensitive information that will be shared ; the format ting, \nequivalency, and interfaces of shared information will n eed to be negotiated  by IT \nsecurity leadership . \nTo ensure federation does not create an unacceptable risk, mitigating controls need to \nbe established to address interoperability or capability gaps , as well as  differences in \nmaturity levels .  \nAt higher matu rity levels , organizations and their partners may be required to share  \nsensitive risk -base d attributes, access to back -end credential and inventory repositories, \nand detailed system access logs . Access p olicies should  reflect access restrictions for \npartner requests. In general, federation between partner organizations is complicated, \nand will depend on the partner agreements, the capabilities and maturity of each \npartners system, and the assessed risk associated with  each system.  \nGuidance to follow when implementing Identity Federation  \n Establish an inventory of partner identities your systems need to support, and \nwhat you know about those identities (user attributes) , includ ing PEs and \nNPEs  \n Map partner identity and cr edential assurance levels and map partner -issued \nattributes to local equivalents.  \n Map access policies to reflect partner sharing agreements, and to account for \npartner identities and attributes.  \n Establish levels of trust for federated identities, and adap t access decisions to \nthose trust levels .

The tools \nand processes support an operational mindset that threats exist within the nominal \nboundaries of their systems. Vigilance is required to ensure that risks are cont inually \nassessed and appropriate responses are enacted in a timely manner, with follow -up \ninvestigations and damage control as necessary. National Security System owners and \noperators are strongly recommended  to mature  their Identity  Management , Credential  \nManagement , Access Management , and operational practices  of their enterprise, \nworking through the capabilities outlined towards advance d maturity .  \nIdentity Management begins with establishing a current and accurate inventory of all \nusers, including perso n and non -person entities, ensuring those with access to critical \nresources are vetted and registered. Credential Management includes enforcing multi -\nfactor authentication and the issuance, usage, and revocation of credentials bound to \nenterprise identitie s. Access Management includes implementing concepts of least  \nprivilege , working towards the goal of fine-grained access control . Identity federation will \ndepend on partner agreements, the capabilities and maturity of each partners system, \nand the assessed  risk associated with each system.  Organizations and their partners \nshould work towards advancing each of these areas through the FICAM roadmap  to \nmature their Zero Trust implementations . \nCommon Exceptions  \nWhile all systems should cons ider improvements bas ed on the Z ero Trust security \nmodel, certain types of systems may not be amenable to the specific constraints of \nparticular Zero  Trust designs. In certain scenarios, especially for safety and \neffectiveness purposes, such users may not be able to be individ ually authenticated. \nFor example, facilities and industrial control centers where personnel must be able to \ntake actions at a moments notice or certain weapons platforms where constant re -\nauthentication may be impractical.  Other mechanisms, sometimes even  non-technical \nones, may be necessary for access control in these cases.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/127344 -23 | PP-23-0208  | APR 2023 Ver. 1.1  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar  \n20 Further guidance  \nNSA is assisting DoD customers that are  piloting ZT capabilitie s, coordinating ZT \nactivities with NIST, CISA, NSS , and DoD, and developing additional ZT guidance to \nsupport system developers through the challenges of integrating ZT within NSS, DoD, \nand D efense Industrial Base (DIB)  environments.
