The updated release informed users that devices continue to be vulnerable after the 29 \nJanuary 2018 advisory and softw are release.  Furthermore, Cisco disclosed the existence of additional vulnerable \nfeatures.  The updated advisory, released 5 February 2018, recommends users again install updated software since the \nversions released on 29 January 2018 do not include fixes  for the newly disclosed vulnerabilities.  \nBelow is a consolidated list of affected products and features. Refer to Cisco Security Center for a complete list of \nvulnerable products and configurations.4 \n- 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)  \n- ASA 550 0 Series Adaptive Security Appliances  \n- ASA 5500 -X Series Next -Generation Firewalls  \n- ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers  \n- ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall  \n- Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)  \n- Firepower 2100 S eries Security Appliance  \n- Firepower 4110 Security Appliance  \n- Firepower 4120 Security Appliance  \n- Firepower 4140 Security Appliance  \n- Firepower 4150 Security Appliance  \n- Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module  \n- Firepower Threat Defense Software (FTD)  \n- FTD Virtual  \nThis announcement relates to and contains updated information regarding IAVA 2018 -A-0042 Cisco Adaptive Security \nAppliance (ASA) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability released 01 February 2018.  \nMITIGATION ACTIONS  \nThe only effective mitigating action is to update Cisco software to the latest version by visiting the Cisco Software \nCenter4F 5. The Cisco advisory contains an incomplete workaround that addresses a single vulnerable feature by \nrestricting management access of the security appliance to known and trusted h osts. The workaround does not fully \nmitigate the vulnerability and leaves customers vulnerable to the attack vectors affecting the va rious other vulnerable \nfeatures.  \n  \n                                                \n1 Cisco and Firepower are registered trademarks of Cisco Systems, Inc.  \n2 https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco -sa-20180129 -asa1#fixed  \n3 CVE is a registered trademark of the MITRE Corporation  \n4 https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco -sa-20180129 -asa1#fixed   \n5 https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html  \n\n \n \n2 U/OO/113030 -18          PP-18-0086          6 FEBRUARY 2018  \n  \n \nCustomers using Cisco ASA Software prior to release 9.1 as well as the affect 9.3 and 9.5 are recommended to migrate to \na supported and unaffected release.
