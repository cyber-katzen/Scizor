These #StopRansomware advisories detail \nhistorically and recently observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and \nindicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit \nstopransomware.gov  to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn about other \nransomware threats and no -cost resourc es. \nThe United States National Security Agency (NSA),  the U.S. Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI ), the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Republic of Korea \n(ROK) National Intelligence Service (NIS) , and the ROK Defense Security Agency \n(DSA)  (hereafter referred to as the authoring agencies) are issuing  this joint \nCyber security Advisory (CSA) to highlight ongoing ransomware  activity  against \nHealthcare and Public Health Sector  organizations  and other critical infrastructure \nsector  entities .  \nThis CSA provides an overview of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK ) \nstate -sponsored ransomware and updates the July 6, 2022 , joint CSA North Korean \nState -Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and \nPublic Health Sector . This advisory highlights TTPs  and IOCs  DPRK cyber  actors used  \nto gain access to and conduct ransomware attacks against Healthcare and Public \nHealth  (HPH)  Sector organizations and  other critical infrastructure sector  entities , as \nwell as DPRK cyber actors  use of cryptocurrency to demand  ransoms . \n\n  \n \n  \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2  Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Mal icious Cyber Activities  \n2 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR  The authoring agencies  assess  that an unspecified amount of revenue from these \ncryptocurrency operations supports DPRK  national -level priorities  and objectives , \nincluding cyber operations targeting the United States and South Korea governments \nspecific targets include Department of Defense Information Networks and Defense \nIndustrial Base member networks . The IOCs in this product should be useful to sectors \npreviously targeted by DPRK cyber operations (e.g., U.S. government, Department of \nDefense, and Defense Industrial Base).  The authoring agencies  highly discourage \npaying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered and \nmay pose sanctions risks.  \nFor additional information on state -sponsored DPRK  malicious cyber activity, see \nCISAs North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  webpage.  \nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see  AA23 -040A.stix  (STIX, 197 kb).  \nTechnical  Details  \nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 12.  See \nMITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise  for all referenced tactics and tech niques.  \nThis CSA is suppleme ntary to previous reports  on malicious cyber actor acti vities \ninvolving DPRK  ransomware campaigns namely Maui  and H0lyGh0st  ransomware . \nThe authoring agencies  are issuing this advisory to highlight additional observed TTPs \nDPRK  cyber actors are using  to conduct ransomware attacks target ing South  Korean \nand U.S. healthcare systems.   \nObservable  TTPs  \nThe TTPs  associated with DPRK ransomware attacks  include those traditionally \nobserved in ransomware operations. Additionally, these TTPs  span phases from \nacquiring and purchasing infrastructure to conceal ing DPRK  affiliation : \n Acquire Infrastructure  [T1583 ]. DPRK a ctors generate domains, personas,  and \naccounts ; and identify cryptocurrency services to conduct their ransomware  \noperation s. Actors procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with \ncryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime , such as ransomware  and \ncryptocurrency theft .  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n3 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR   Obfuscate Identity. DPRK actors purposely obfuscate their involvement by \noperating with or under third -party foreign affiliate identities  and use third-party \nforeign intermediaries to receive ransom payments.  \n Purchase VPNs and VPSs  [T1583.003 ]. DPRK cyber actors will also use virtual \nprivate networks (VPNs) and virtual private servers (VPS s) or third -country IP \naddresses to  appear to  be from innocu ous locations i nstead of from DPRK . \n Gain Access  [TA0001 ]. Actors use various exploits of common vulnerabilities \nand exposures (CVE) to gain access and escalate privileges on networks. \nRecently observed CVEs that actors used to gain access include remote code \nexecution in the Apache Log4j software library  (known as Log4Shell ) and remote \ncode execution in unpatched  SonicWall SMA 100 appliances  [T1190  and T1133 ]. \nObserved CVEs used include:  \no CVE 2021 -44228  \no CVE-2021 -20038  \no CVE-2022 -24990  \nActors also likely spread malicious code through Trojanized files for X -Popup , an open \nsource messenger commonly used by employees of small and medium hospitals in \nSouth Korea [T1195 ].  \nThe actors spread malware  by leveraging two domains: xpopup.pe [.]kr and \nxpopup.com . xpopu p.pe [.]kr is registered to IP address 115.68.95 [.]128 and \nxpopup [.]com is registered to IP address 119.205.197 [.]111. Related file names and \nhashes are listed in table 1.  \nTable 1: Malicious file names and hashes spread by xpopup domains  \nFile Name  MD5 Hash  \nxpopup.rar  1f239db751ce9a374eb9f908c74a31c9  \nX-PopUp.exe  6fb13b1b4b42bac05a2ba629f04e3d03  \nX-PopUp.exe  cf8ba073db7f4023af2b13dd75565f3d  \nxpopup.exe  4e71d52fc39f89204a734b19db1330d3  \nx-PopUp.exe  43d4994635f72852f719abb604c4a8a1  \nxpopup.exe  5ae71e8440bf33b46554ce7a7f3de666  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n4 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR   \n Move Laterally and Discover y [TA0007 , TA0008 ]. After initial access, DPRK \ncyber actors use staged payloads with customized malware to perform \nreconnaissance activities, upload and download additional files and executables, \nand execute shell commands [ T1083 , T1021 ]. The staged  malware is also \nresponsible for collecting victim information and sending it to the remote host \ncontrolled by the actors [ TA0010 ].  \n Employ Various Ransomware Tools  [TA0040 ]. Actors have used privately \ndeveloped ransomware , such as Maui and H0lyGh0st  [T1486 ]. Actors have also \nbeen observed using or possessing  publically available tools for encryption , such \nas BitLocker, Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0, \nMy Little Ransomware, NxRansomware , Ryuk,  and YourRansom  [T1486 ]. In \nsome cases,  DPRK actors have portrayed themselves as other ransomware \ngroups, such as the REvil ransomware group. For IOCs associated with Maui \nand H0lyGh0st ransomware usage, please see Appendix B.  \n Demand Ransom in Cryptocurrency . DPRK cyber actors have b een observed \nsetting ransoms in bitcoin  [T1486 ]. Actors are known to communicate with victims \nvia Proton Mail email accounts. For private companies in the healthcare sector, \nactors may threaten to expose a company s proprietary data to competitors if \nransoms are not paid.  Bitcoin wallet addresses possibly used by DPRK  cyber \nactors include:  \no 1MTHBCrBKYEthfa16zo9kabt4f9jMJz8Rm  \no bc1q8 0vc4yjgg6umedkut3e9mhehxl4q4dcjjyzh59  \no 1J8spy62o7z2AjQxoUpiCGnBh5cRWKVWJC  \no 16ENLdHbnmDcEV8iqN4vuyZHa7sSdYRh76  \no bc1q3wzxvu8yhs8h7mlkmf7277wyklkah9k4sm9anu  \no bc1q8xyt4jxhw7mgqpwd6qfdjyxgvjeuz57jxrvgk9  \no 1NqihEqYaQaWiZkPVdSMiTbt7dTy1LMxgX  \no bc1qxrpevck3pq1yzrx2pq2rkvk vy0jnm56nzjv6pw  \no 14hVKm7Ft2rxDBFTNkkRC3kGstMGp2A4hk  \no 1KCwfCUgnSy3pzNX7U 1i5NwFzRtth4bRBc  \no 16sYqXancDD iijcuruZecCkdBDwDf4vSEC  \no 1N6JphHFaYmYaokS5xH31Z67bvk4ykd9CP  \no LZ1VNJfn6mWjPzkCyoBvqWaBZYXAwn135  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n5 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR  o 1KmWW6LgdgykBBrSXrFu9kdoHz95Fe9kQF  \no 1FX4W9rrG4F3Uc7gJ18GCwGab8XuW8Ajy2  \no bc1qlqgu2l2kms5338zuc95kxavctzyy0v705tpvyc  \no bc1qy6su7vrh7ts5ng2628escmhr98msmzg62ez2sp  \no bc1q8t69gpxsezdcr8w6tfzp3jeptq4tcp2g9d0mwy  \no bc1q9h7yj79sqm4t536q0fdn7n4y2atsvvl22m28ep  \no bc1qj6y72rk039mqpgtcy7mwjd3eum6cx6027ndgmd  \no bc1qcp557vltuu3qc6pk3ld0ayagrxuf2thp3pjzpe  \no bc1ql8wsflrjf9zlusauynzjm83mupq6c9jz9vnqxg  \no bc1qx60ec3nfd5yhsyyxkzkpts54w970yxj84zrdck  \no bc1qunqnjdlvqkjuhtclfp8kzkjpvdz9qnk898xczp  \no bc1q6024d73h48fnhwswhwt3hqz2lzw6x99q0nulm4  \no bc1qwdvexlyvg3mqvqw7g6l09qup0qew80wjj9jh7 x \no bc1qavrtge4p7dmcrnvhlvuhaarx8rek76wxyk7dgg  \no bc1qagaayd57vr25dlqgk7f00nhz9qepqgnlnt4upu  \no bc1quvnaxnpqlzq3mdhfddh35j7e7ufxh3gpc56hca  \no bc1qu0pvfmtxawm8s99lcjvxapungtsmkvwyvak6cs  \no bc1qg3zlxxhhcvt6hkuhmqml8y9pas76cajcu9ltdl  \no bc1qn7a3g23nzpuytchyyteyhkcse84cnylznl3 j32 \no bc1qhfmqstxp3yp9muvuz29wk77vjtdyrkff4nrxpu  \no bc1qnh8scrvuqvlzmzgw7eesyrmtes9c5m78duetf3  \no bc1q7qry3lsrphmnw3exs7tkwzpvzjcxs942aq8n0y  \no bc1qcmlcxfsy0zlqhh72jvvc4rh7hvwhx6scp27na0  \no bc1q498fn0gauj2kkjsg35mlwk2cnxhaqlj7hkh8xy  \no bc1qnz4udqkumjghnm2a3zt0w3ep8fwdcyv3krr3jq  \no bc1qk0saaw7p0wrwla6u7tfjlxrutlgrwnudzx9tyw  \no bc1qyue2pgjk09ps7qvfs559k8kee3jkcw4p4vdp57  \no bc1q6qfkt06xmrpclht3acmq00p7zyy0ejydu89zwv  \no bc1qmge6a7sp659exnx78zhm9zgrw88n6un0rl9trs  \no bc1qcywkd7zqlwmjy36c46dpf8cq6ts6wgkjx0u7c n \nMitigations   \nNote: These mitigations align with the Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals \n(CPGs) developed by CISA and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST).

Only store personal patient data on internal \nsystems that are protected by firewalls, and ensure extensive backups are \navailable.  \no Create and regularly review internal policies t hat regulate the collection, \nstorage, access, and monitoring of PII/PHI.  \n Implement and enforce multi -layer network segmentation with the most critical \ncommunications and data resting on the most secure and reliable layer  [CPG \n8.1]. \n Use monitoring tools to observe whether IoT devices are behaving erratically due \nto a compromise  [CPG 3.1 ]. \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n7 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR  In addition, the authoring agencies  urge all organizations, including HPH Sector \norganizations,  to apply the following recommendations to prep are for  and mitigate \nransomware incidents : \n Maintain isolated  backups of data, and regularly test  backup and \nrestoration  [CPG 7.3 ]. These practices safeguard an organizations continuity of  \noperations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident \nand protect  against data losses.  \no Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or \ndeleted),  and covers the ent ire organizations data infrastructure .  \n Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and \nassociated communications plan that includes response procedures for a \nransomware incident  [CPG 7.1, 7.2 ]. \no Organizations  should  also ensure their incident response and \ncommunications plans include data breach incidents response and \nnotification  procedures. Ensure the notification procedures adhere to \napplicable laws.  \no See the CISA -Multi -State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS -\nISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide  and CISA Fact Sheet Protecting Sensitive \nand Personal Information from Ransomware -Caused Dat a Breaches  for \ninformation on creating a ransomware response checklist and planning \nand responding to ransomware -caused data breaches.  \n Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as \nthey are released  [CPG 5.1 ]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and \ncost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to \ncybersecurity threa ts. Regularly check for software updates and end -of-life \nnotifications and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities . Consider \nleveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite \nthe process.  \n If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or other potentially risky \nservices, secure and monitor them closely  [CPG 5.4 ]. \no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting \nRDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP \nis deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and \nrequire  phishing -resistant  multifactor authentication (MFA)  to mitigate \ncredential theft and reuse  [CPG 1.3 ]. If RDP must be available externally, \nuse a VPN , virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n8 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR  and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal \ndevices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after \na specified numb er of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP \nlogin attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports  [CPG 1.1, \n3.1]. \no Ensure devices are p roperly configured and that security features are \nenabled. Disable ports and protocols not in use  for a business purpose \n(e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol port 3389).  \no Restrict the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol within the network to \nonly access  necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions \nof SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate \nmalware across organizations.  \no Review the security posture of third -party vendors and those \ninterconnected with your organization. En sure all connections between \nthird-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and \nreviewed for suspicious activity  [CPG 5.6, 6.2 ]. \no Implement application control  policies that only allow systems to execute \nknown and permitted programs  [CPG 2.1 ]. \no Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active \ncontent from running.  \n Implement a user training program and phishing e xercises  [CPG 4.3 ] to \nraise awareness among users about the risks of visiting websites, clicking on \nlinks, and opening attachments. Reinforce the appr opriate user response to \nphishing and spearphishing emails.  \n Require phishing -resistant MFA  for as many services as possible  [CPG \n1.3]particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and \nprivileged accounts that manage backups.  \n Use strong passwords  [CPG 1.4 ] and avoid reusing passwords for multiple \naccounts. See CISA Tip Choosing and Protec ting Passwords  and National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800 -63B: \nDigital Identity Guidelines  for more information.  \n Require administrator credentials to install software  [CPG 1.5 ]. \n Audit user accounts with administrative or elevated privileges  [CPG 1.5 ] \nand configure access controls with least privilege in mind.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 114471 -23 | PP-23-0183  | FEB 2023 Ver. 1. 2 Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  \n9 TLP:CLEAR  \nTLP:CLEAR   Install and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software on all \nhosts . \n Only use secure networks .
