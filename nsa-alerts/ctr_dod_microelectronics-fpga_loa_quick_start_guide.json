While comprised of nine documents in total, the LoA \nseries does not require  all th e volumes for its application. Users need only read and \napply the guidance found in, at most, two documents. Other  documents in the series \naddress the methods used to develop the guidance, advi ce on how to replicate this \nprocess for other types of microelect ronic devices , and include definitions. Users only \nneed to concern themselves with:  \n The appropriate level best practice guide  \n The accompanying third-party intellectual property ( IP) review guide  \nThe following table lists the nine LoA documents and their purpose s: \nTable 1: Level of Assurance best practice guidance Documents  \nDocument  Purpose  \nDoD Microelectr onics: Field Programmable Gate Array \nOverall Assurance Process  Background  \nDoD Microelectronics: Levels of Assurance Definitions and \nApplications  Background  \nDoD Microelectronics: Field Programmable Gate Array \nBest Practices  Threat Catalog  Background  \nDoD Microelectronics: Field Programmable Gate Array \nLevel of Assurance 1 Best Practices  Guidance LoA1  \nDoD Microelectronics: Third -Party IP Review Process for \nLevel of Assurance 1  Guidance LoA1  \nDoD Microelectronics: Field Programmable Gate Array \nLevel of Assurance 2 Best Practices  Guidance LoA2  \nDoD Microelectronics: Third -Party IP Review Process for \nLevel of Assurance 2  Guidance LoA2  \nDoD Microelectronics: Field Programmable Gate Array \nLevel of Assurance 3 Best Practices  Guidance LoA3  \nDoD Microelectronics: Third -Party IP Review Process for \nLevel of Assurance 3  Guidance LoA3  \n \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 208512 -23 | PP-23-3453  | OCT  2023 Ver. 1.0  3 National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Technical Report  \nFPGA Level of Assurance Quick Start Guide  \nQuick s tart steps \nOverview  \nThe application of the LoA guidance consists of the following four simple steps :  \n1. Determine the appropriate level of assurance for the top-level system.  \n2. Determine the appropriate level of assurance for the FPGA device (s). \n3. Select the appropriate best practice guide.  \n4. Apply the guidance.  \n1. Determine the appropriate  LoA for the top -level system  \nThe first step in applying the LoA guidance ide ntifies the appropriate LoA for the top -\nlevel system in which the FPGA will operate, a determination made by the program \nbased on the potential national -level impact caused by the failure or subversion of the \ntop-level system. This determine s the highest p ossible level of assurance for the FPGA \ndevice.  \nThe FPGA device should not be protected at a level hi gher than the system in which it \noperates.  A U.S. Government ( USG ) person with authority over the program should \nselect the appropriate LoA for the overall program using the criteria in the following \ntable:  \nTable 2: Top-level system LoA criteria  as determined by national impact  \nLevel of Assurance  Typical Criteria  \n \n If the system fails, USG capability will be reduced in a \nmeaningful way. If the system is subverted, it can cause harm \nto U.S. personnel, property, or interests. However:  \n Essential operational capabilities for the DoD will \nremain available even during a system failure.  \n If the system fails, the consequences will be grave. If the \nsystem is subverted, it can cause serious harm to U.S. \npersonnel, property, or interests. However:  \n Essential operational capabilities for the DoD may be \ndegraded during a system failure, and  \nLoA 2  \nLoA 1  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 208512 -23 | PP-23-3453  | OCT  2023 Ver. 1.0  4 National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Technical Report  \nFPGA Level of Assurance Quick Start Guide  \nLevel of Assurance  Typical Criteria  \n Redundant capabilities can be brought online as part of \na continuity of operations plan, and  \n The failure of the system will not cause cascade effects \nacross many DoD or allied systems.  \n If the system fails, the consequences will be extremely grave. \nIf the system is subverted, it can cause exceptionally grave \nharm to U.S. personnel, property, or interests. A failure or \nsubversion of this system:  \n May represent an existential risk to the US G, and  \n May cascade across many DoD systems in a way that \nimpacts total operational readiness in an immediate \nway, and  \n Will interrupt essential operational capabilities of the \nDoD.  \nSelect the top-level LoA. This now represents the highest level at which  the FPGA \ndevice can be protected.  \n2. Determine the appropriate LoA for the FPGA device(s)  \nThe second step determine s the appropriate LoA for each FPGA device in the sub -\nsystem. The device LoA is based upon the devices criticality to t he system in which it \noperates.  This criticality is determined during the programs Trusted Systems and \nNetworks ( TSN) analysis required by the Program Protection Plan.  The programs TSN \nanalysis determines  the assignment of a level of criticality commensurate with the \nconse quence to the sub -system of the components failure. The following table lists the \nTSN levels of criticality and the corresponding LoAs :  \nTable 3: TSN criticality and corresponding Levels of Assurance  \nTSN Criticality  Description  LoA Mapping  \nLevel I:  \nTotal Mission Failure  Failure that results in total \ncompromise of mission capability  LoA3  \nLoA 3  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 208512 -23 | PP-23-3453  | OCT  2023 Ver. 1.0  5 National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Technical Report  \nFPGA Level of Assurance Quick Start Guide  \nTSN Criticality  Description  LoA Mapping  \nLevel II:  \nSignificant  / \nUnacceptable \nDegradation  Failure that results in unacceptable \ncompromise of mission capability or \nsignificant mission degradation  LoA2  \nLevel III:   \nPartial  / Acceptable  Failure that results in partial \ncompromise of a mission capability \nor partial mission degradation  LoA1  \nLevel IV: Negligible  Failure that results in little or no \ncompromise of mission capability   N/A; Although LoA1 \nmitigations are \nrecommended  \nAlthough components can receive a lower LoA than the system, a component cannot \nreceive  a higher LoA than the system. For example, an LoA1 system cannot require \nLoA3 components .  \nProgram analysts can refer to the following table to determine the appropriate LoA for a \ngiven component  having determined the TSN criticality level.  \nTable 4: Mapping critical components to Levels of Assurance  \nSystem \nLoA TSN Criticality of Component to the System  \nNegligible  Partial / \nAcceptable  Significant / \nUnacceptable  Total Mission \nFailure  \nLoA 1  N/A LoA 1  LoA 1  LoA 1  \nLoA 2  LoA 1  LoA 1  LoA 2  LoA 2  \nLoA 3  LoA 1  LoA 2  LoA 3  LoA 3  \nDetermine the LoA for each FPGA device in the sub -system.  \n3. Select the appropriate best practice guide \nAfter identifying the device LoA, the user can download the ap propriate best practice \nguide  and its accompanying IP review guide from the NSA website , \nhttps://www.nsa.gov/Press -Room/DoD -Microelectronics -Guidance/ . Each best practice \nguide is complete and does not require information or support of the lower -level guides. \nThat is, for LoA3, the user does not also need LoA2 and LoA1 documents.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 208512 -23 | PP-23-3453  | OCT  2023 Ver. 1.0  6 National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Technical Report  \nFPGA Level of Assurance Quick Start Guide  \n4. Apply the guidance  \nEach best practice guide contains all the guidance necessary to mitigate threats at the \nintended level. In addition to the mitigation details, the documents include a chec klist \nthat users can use to track the chosen options, a glossary , and contact information for \nhelp or questions.  \n\n",
