While c ontrol centers were no t fully operational for two months, the situation  \ncould have been much worse : the companies  manual backup functionality allowed operator s to restore power  in only a \nmatter of hours  [1]. \nThe city of Atlanta was not so lucky. In March 2018, the city fell victim to a cyberattack employing SamSam ransomware , \nwhich encrypted files and locked  the city s computer systems blocking much needed access to services and portals \nand forced  the city bac k into the era of handwri tten reports and carbon copies . Years of valuable files and data were lost \n[2]. Roughly s ix million people call metropolitan Atlanta home  and rely on its services . The city requested $9.5  million to \naid in recovery  from the ransomw are, and  the aftershocks would be felt for some time: t hree months later, in June of \n2018, an estimated third of the city s affected software progr ams remained hobbled, some of them  completely offline  [2], \n[3], [4]. \nThere i s some good news: a  2017 report from Datto, Inc. found that 96% of small -to-mid-sized businesses were able to \nfully recover from a ransomware infection  with use of a reliable backup and disaster recovery solution  [5]. Regardless of \nthe cause of data or system loss, organizat ions must be prepared in order to quickly recover to full operations.  \nInformation systems are vital elements of most modern day organizations ; it is imperative that those services and \nfunctions remain intact or recoverable in the face of disaster. By imple menting a System Recovery Plan (SRP), \norganizations  can prepare for disruptions stemming from natural disasters, technological failures, user errors , and \nmalicious actions , and minimize the impact to their operations. System Recovery Plans are  a valuable method of ensuring \nquick and effective restoration of  system functionality , including data and configuration . About  70% of professionals have \nor will experience data loss due to accidental deletion, disk or system failure, viruses, fire , or some other disa ster. And \n60% of companies that lose a significant amount of th eir data will shut down within six  months of the disaster  [6]. \nTHE SYSTEM RECOVERY PLAN  \nLIFECYCLE  \nThis section describes the process for creating and maintaining  a useful SRP. The process is general to all information \nsystems and should be modified and tailored to each organization  implementing the plan.  \n \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 181473 -19          PP-19-1042          AUGUST 2019  \n2 Develop the Contingency Plan Policy Statement  \nThis statement describes how the SRP align s with the objectives  of the organization.  Key policy elements include  roles \nand responsibilities; scope , as it applies to common platform types and enterprise  functions; resource requirements; \ntraining requirements; exercise and testing schedules; plan maintenance schedule; and minimum frequency of backups \nand storage of backup media.  \nConduct a Business Impact Analysis  \nThe Business Impact Analysis (BIA) relates the organizations critical processes to the consequences resulting from \ndisruption of those processes. Three core steps are involved in performing the BIA : \n1. Determi ne business processes and recovery criticality  \n2. Identify resource requirements  \n3. Identify system resource recovery priorities  \nIdentify preventive c ontrols  \nMitigating or eliminating  the effects of physical  outages through preventative measures  can greatly red uce impacts to the \nsystem.  Some common measures that may be applied are  appropriately sized uninterruptible power supplies, generators \nto provide long term backup power, cooling systems with capacity to prevent failure of components, fire suppression \nsyste ms, fire and smoke detectors, and water sensors.  Redundancy should be integrated at all levels of the system to \nprevent system outages. Devices such as authentication servers, routers, and switches often have high availability \nfunctionality which can be en abled to provide automated failover.  \nIn recent years , ransomware has proliferated to epidemic proportion s, and countless variants affect most major classes of \ncomputing platforms , including servers, workstations, mobile devices , and industrial control syst ems, among others . Some \nrestore systems upon payment of demands, while others will not. Many are capable of infecting or corrupting common \nbackup technologies, irrespective of their physical locations, making offline backups of critical data , software,  and services \nabsolutely essential. Since offline backups are much more difficult to  perform, they should generally be reserved as a last \nline of defense against the most catastrophic of losses.  \nIn general, when it comes to ransomware, an ounce of prevention  is worth a pound of cure . Recovery often requires \nwiping a system and starting over . The development of an SRP should inform the prioritization of common defenses , \nincluding hunting activities1 and the enforcement of si gned software policies2 or applicati on whitelists . If a system is critical \nto the organization , preventing unknown software from running on it is typically the best way to stop ransomware.  \nCreate contingency s trategies  \nContingency strategies cover the full range of backup, recovery, continge ncy planning, testing, and ongoing maintenance.  \nSystems should be backed up regularly and policies should detail the minimum frequency and scope of backups in  \naddition to the location of stored data . Backup and recovery strategies address how to restore op erations quickly and \neffectively  during both planned and unplanned downtimes.  \nData is not the only thing that an organization must back  up. Some organizations depend on critical physical processes \nthat could be effected by the corruption of non -traditional computing platforms like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) . \nFor these organizations, having physical replacements for certain components  and gold copies of their configurations  on \nhand may be th e best option.  For no -fail items, like generators , medical devices , and  weapon systems , having spare \ncomponents is always essential . \nPlan Testing, Training, and Exercises  \nA Testing, Training, and Exercises ( TT&E ) program defines  methods for determining, sc heduling, and setting  objectives \nfor TT&E activities. Testing allows for detection of any faults in the recovery plan.  Training instills confidence in \n                                                \n1 For more information on threat hunting, refer to Continuously Hunt for Network Intrusions , part of the NSA Cybersecurity Top 10 Mitigations.   \n2 For more information on signed software policies, refer to Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies , part of the NSA Cybersecurity Top 10 Mitigations.  \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 181473 -19          PP-19-1042          AUGUST 2019  \n3 personnels ability to perform their roles and responsibilities during recovery.  Exercises simulate an  \nunplanned outage, enabling personnel to practice their recovery skills and  to uncover any gaps in the SRP.  \nComplete guidance on creating a TT&E program can be found in NIST SP 800-84 [10]. \nPlan m aintenance  \nThe SRP must be maintained in order to reflect the  current status of requirements, procedures, and policies as well as \nany changes in the environment.  To maintain the SRP, it should be reviewed for accuracy at a defined frequency or \nwhenever significant changes are made.  \nCLOUD CONSIDERATIONS  \nNetwork security administrators have additional considerations  when exercising system recovery for networks hosted in \nthe cloud. When utilizing cloud services, negotiate  a service agreement containing contractual language that clearly \ndelineates the recove ry responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the cloud consumer. If an agreement is \nnot made, the consumer should assume recovery responsibilities in the event of a disaster.  Even if the provider assumes \nrecovery responsibilities,  the consume r should  have a backup recovery plan in t he event that the providers recovery \nprocess fails.  In either case, the SRP still needs TT&E to ensure proper recovery in the cloud environment.  \nNetwork security administrators can also outsource the entire system recovery process  for certain types of failures  to \ncloud service providers using Disaster Recovery -as-a-Service ( DRaaS). While DRaaS saves time and resources that \nwould otherwise be spent on  certain parts of  in-house system recovery planning, network securi ty administrators must still \nprepare their network to be able to recover critical functions i n the event that the DRaaS fails.  \nDECIDING TO AUTOMATE  \nWhile countless benefits come from automating many business processes, an organization pursuing automation s hould \ncarefully consider how it will operate in the case of a loss of computing services. When automatin g processes, ensure \nrecovery plans are documented. Manual processes may be essential  as a temporary alternative option . \nBOUNCE BACK CONFIDEN TLY \nNetworks  are never  fully protected from threats and failures. Network security administrators must exercise a system \nrecovery plan to use as  the next mitigation when network resource s are lost. SRPs incorporate people, policies, and \nprocedures needed to provide cr itical information and coordination for networks to return to normal operations after a \ncatastrophic event. By using both  in-house and cloud recovery options, e nterprise s can achieve cost  and resource  \nsavings by reducing the impact to business operations and avoiding the extra manpower that would otherwise be required \nto rebuild lost network hosts and services.  The system recovery plan , along with its essential testing, training, and \nexercises , will instill resilience into enterprise networks and enable th em to maintain critical operations while bouncing -\nback from adverse events with an efficient recovery.  \nREFERENCES  \n[1]  K.
