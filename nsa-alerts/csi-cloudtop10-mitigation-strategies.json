Many \ncloud breaches occur due to misconfigurations in cloud tenants. NSAs Top Ten Cloud \nSecur ity Mitigation Strategies inform cloud customers  of the most important practices to \nimprove the security posture of their cloud environments . As organizations  shift their \ndata to the cloud for ease of processing, storing, and sharing, they must take \nprecau tions to maintain parity with on -premises security  and mitigate additional cloud -\nspecific threats . The following sections outline NSAs top ten recommended mitigation \nstrategies that cloud customers should take to  improve their security posture. Each \nstrategy has an associated cybersecurity information sheet that describes it in more \ndetail at the following:   \n1. Uphold the Cloud Shared Responsibility Model  \n2. Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \n3. Use Secure Cloud Key Management Practices  \n4. Implement Network Segmentation and Encrypti on in Cloud Environments  \n5. Secure Data in the Cloud  \n6. Defend ing Continuous Integration /Continuous Delivery (C I/CD) Environments  \n7. Enforce Secure Automated Deployment Practices thro ugh Infrastructure as Code  \n8. Account for Complexities Introduced by  Hybrid Cloud and Multi -Cloud Environments  \n9. Mitigate Risks from Managed Service Providers in Cloud Environments  \n10. Manage Cloud Logs for Effective Threat Hunting  \n1. Uphold the Cloud Shared Responsibility Model    \nSecurity gaps arise when customers assume that the cloud service provider (CSP)  is \nsecuring something that is actually the customers  responsibility. Customers must  \nunderstand the CSPs shared responsibility model  (SRM) , which identifies who is \nresponsible for security based on the type of service acquired (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS). \nThe SRM  will vary from service to service, and it may also vary by CSP , so close \nattention to documentation and best practice guides is essential. D irect engagement \nwith the CSP  may sometimes be  necessary  to understand their service  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 126059 -24 | PP-24-0616  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 \n 2 NSA | NSAs Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies  \nmodel s. Customers should hold the CSP accountable for its part, while the customer s \nmust dutifully fulfill their own tenant responsibilities.  \n2. Use Secure  Cloud  Identity and Access Manag ement  \nPractices  \nProper i dentity and access management (IAM) are critical to securing cloud resources . \nMalicious actors can compromise accounts using phishing techniques, exposed \ncredentials , or weak authentication practices to gain initial access into cloud tenants. \nThey can also exploit overly broad  access control policies to penetrate further into the \nenvironment, gaining access to sensitive resources. To prevent this , cloud users should \nuse se cure authentication methods such as phishing -resistant multifactor authentication \n(MFA) and properly managed temporary credentials. Access control policies should be \ncarefully configured to ensure users are granted the least privileges necessary . \nSeparatio n of duties should be  implemented to protect especially sensitive operations \nand resources.  \n3. Use Secure Cloud Key Management Practices    \nCSPs offer a variety of methods for handling key management , ranging from full \nreliance on the cloud vendor for fully delegated server -side encryption, to a full client -\nside encryption  method where the customer generates and manages the keys \nthemselves and encrypts all data prior to uploading it. In most cases, organizations will  \nrely on the CSP for a portion of key  management, encryption, and decryption . However \norganizations handle this , it is vital that they understand the risks and benefits to each \noption and their roles and responsibilities for properly managing keys.  \n4. Implement Network Segmentation and Encry ption  in Cloud \nEnvironments  \nOrganizations using cloud resources must implement controls in their tenant to prevent \nand detect MCA  activities. Zero Trust (ZT) network security practices , such as \nevaluating identity information in all requests , micro  segment ation , and end -to-end \nencryption , should be used to protect organizational data. Micro  segmentation is a larg e \npart of the prevention effort by separat ing resources based on organizational team, \napplication workflow, and data ingress/egress, as applicable.  Restricting  resources to \nonly the communication paths necessary to support normal function ality greatly limits \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 126059 -24 | PP-24-0616  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 \n 3 NSA | NSAs Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies  \nMCAs  with access to the tenant. End-to-end encryption of  all data in transit to, from, and \nwithin the cloud is also key to pr otecting data in the cloud .  \n5. Secur e Data in the Cloud    \nThe cloud presents an attractive target to malicious actors for data theft and ransom. \nOrganizations can secure their data by selecting appropriate cloud storage, preventing \nexposure over public IPs, enforcing leas t privilege,  using object versioning,  creating \nimmutable backups with recovery plans, enabling encryption, and regularly reviewing \ndata security measures. Organizations should understand CSP data retention policies \nand then  choose the appropriate options for storing sensitive data . In addition, \norganizations should  consider enabling soft delete features  to mitigate the effects of \naccidental  or malicious  deletions.  \n6. Defend ing Continuous Int egration/Continuous Delivery \n(CI/CD) Environments  \nAn organizatio ns development, security, and operations ( DevSecOps ) procedures  are \ncritical to the security of their environment . Continuous integration and continuous \ndelivery  (CI/CD) pipelines are a key part of this process and are frequently deployed in \nthe cloud. These pipelines make valuable targets for MCAs as a successful compromise \nof a CI/CD pipeline could impact  both infrastructure and applications . Organizations \nshould  follow best practices in securing their organizations CI/CD pipelines, such as \nstrong IAM practices, keeping tools up to date, auditing logs, implementing security \nscanning, and properly handling secrets.  \n7. Enforce Secure Automated Deployment Practices  through \nInfrastructure as Code (IaC)   \nInfrastructure  as code (IaC) automate s the deployment of cloud resources. The \nelimination of manual infrastructure deployment reduces the likelihood of \nmisconfigurations and ghost assets introduced by human error . IaC  allows \norganizations to quickly detect unauthorized changes to infrastructure. Policy  as code \ncodif ies security and compliance best practices.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 126059 -24 | PP-24-0616  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 \n 4 NSA | NSAs Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies  \nPrior to IaC deployment, organizations should create a threat model1 to map attack \nvectors, determine if IaC templates will be declarative or imperative, complete static \napplication security testing, and consider integrating existing CI/CD processes. After \ndeployment , organizations  should dynamic ally test deployed resource s, ensure access \nand version controls are enabled, avoid manual changes, and continuous ly log and \nmonitor resources .  \n8. Account for Complexities Introduced by Hybrid Cloud and \nMulti -Cloud Environments  \nOrganizations should a ccount for complexities that may  arise when using hybrid cloud \nand multi -cloud environments. The use of hybrid and multi -cloud environments \nintroduces operational silos and skill gaps , which may lead to configuration \ndiscrepancies, unnecessary data flows, insecure IAM, loss of  visibility , and  exploitable \nsecurity gaps . Network, IAM, and logging best practices should be used to maintain \nsecure cloud infrastructures. Standardizing cloud operations with vendor agnostic tools \nallows  organizations to maintain and monitor multiple environments from a centralized \nlocation.  \n9. Mitigate  Risk s from Managed Service Providers in Cloud \nEnvironments  \nWhile managed service providers (MSPs) can provide useful technical support for \nadministering, maintaining , and/or securing a cloud environment, using an MSP can \nincrease an organizations attack surface . Organizations should  make security a priority \nwhen choosing a n MSP  in order to mitigate threats to the cloud tenant through the MSP . \nOrganizations should s elect providers that c omply with the security standards and \npractices important to the organization. In addition, organizations should a udit MSP \naccounts and operations in the environment , prioritizing privileged accounts and \nactivities. Organizations should also i ntegrate MSP services into security operations, \nsystem recovery, and incident response processes.  \n                                            \n1 For more information on what a threat model is and how to go about writing one consider reviewing OWASPs Threat Modeling \nresources: https://owasp.org/www -community/Threat_Modeling  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 126059 -24 | PP-24-0616  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 \n 5 NSA | NSAs Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies  \n10. Manage Cloud  Logs for Effective Threat Hunting   \nLogs play a fundamental role in threat detection  for cloud environments. Detecting and \nresponding to security incidents require a thorough understanding of the systems \nactivity and behavior. Cloud systems  involve many users accessing numerous shared \nresources and services . This  commonly includ es ephemer al resources , which create a \ncomplex and dynamic environment  that can be difficult to visualize and monitor . \nOrganizations should collect and aggregate logs from all relevant sources , such as \ncloud services, operating systems, and applications. Cloud envir onments typically offer \nconvenient log aggregation mechanisms for pulling log data into centralized services for \nbetter visualization and threat hunting. Default logging policies vary greatly between \ncloud services, so it is vital that security professiona ls configure these policies to ensure \nMCAs  cannot freely operate within cloud tenants without being detected.  \nSecurity professionals can use tools , such as security information and event \nmanagement (SIEM) systems , log analysis software , and anomaly detection services , to \nanalyze the logs for indicators of compromise and abnormal activity, including unusual \nlogin attempts, network traffic patterns, and anomalous system events. This enables \nsecurity teams to directly respond to threats identified in lo gs and sometimes even \nautomate these actions to respond in real  time.  \nConclusion  \nAs organizations continue to migrate more of their data and services to cloud \nenvironments, MCAs will increasingly attempt to compromise  those environments. \nMisconfigured, uns ecured, or unmonitored cloud systems  will pose enticing targets.  \nNSA recommends that organizations and cloud users follow these mitigation strategies \nto improve their cloud security posture.  \n  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/ 126059 -24 | PP-24-0616  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 \n 6 NSA | NSAs Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies  \nDisclaimer of endorsement  \nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or \nguarantees.
