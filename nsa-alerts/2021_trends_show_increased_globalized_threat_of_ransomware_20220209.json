The Federal \nBureau of Investigation ( FBI), the Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Secur ity Agency (CISA) , and the \nNational Security Agency (NSA)  observed incidents \ninvolving ransomware against  14 of the 16 U.S. \ncritical infrastructure sectors , including the Defense \nIndustrial Base, Emergency Services, Food and \nAgriculture, Government  Facilities , and Information \nTechnology Sectors . The Australian Cyber  Security \nCentre ( ACSC ) observed continued ransomware \ntargeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities, \nincludi ng in the Healthcare and Medical, Financial Services and Markets, Higher Education and \nResearch, and Energy Sectors . The United Kingdoms National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC -UK) \nrecognizes ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the United Kingdom . Education is one of \nthe top UK sectors targeted by ransomware actors , but the NCSC -UK has also seen attacks targeting \nbusinesses, charities, the legal profession , and public services in the Local Government and Health \nSectors.  Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to \nProtect Against Ransomware:  \n Update  your operating system and \nsoftware.  \n Implement user training and phishing \nexercises to raise awareness about the \nrisks of suspicious  links and \nattachments . \n If you use  Remote Desktop Protocol \n(RDP ), secure and monitor it.  \n Make an  offline backup  of your data . \n Use multifactor authentication  (MFA) . \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 2 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    Ransomware tactics and techniques  continued to evolve  in 2021, which demonstrate s ransomware \nthreat actors  growing  technological sophisticat ion and an increased ransomware threat to \norganizations globally . \nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory authored by  cybersecurity authorities in the  United States , \nAustralia, and  the United Kingdom provides  observed  behaviors and  trends  as well as mitigation \nrecommendations to help network defenders reduce their risk of compromise by ransomware . \nTECHNICAL DETAILS  \nCybersecurity  authorities  in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom observed the \nfollowing behaviors and trends among cyber  criminals  in 2021:  \n Gaining  access to networks via phishing, stolen Remote Desktop Protocols ( RDP ) \ncredentials or brute force , and exploiting vul nerabilities . Phishing emails, RDP  \nexploitation , and exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  remained the top three initial infection \nvectors for ransomware incidents in 2021 . Once a ransomware threat actor has gained code \nexecution on a device or network  access, they can deploy ransomware.  Note: these infection \nvectors likely remain popular because of the increased use of remote work and schooling \nstarting in 2020 and continuing through 2021. This  increase  expanded  the remote attack \nsurface and left network defenders struggling to keep pace with routine software patching.  \n Using cybercriminal services -for-hire. The market for ransomware bec ame increasingly \nprofessional  in 2021 , and the criminal business model of ransomware is now well \nestablished . In addition to  their increas ed use of ransomware -as-a-service (RaaS), \nransomware threat actors  employed independent services to negotiate payments, assist \nvictims with making payments, and arbitrate payment disputes between themselves and other \ncyber crimina ls. NCSC -UK observed that some  ransomware threat actors  offered their victims \nthe services of a 24/7 help center to expedite ransom  payment and restoration  of encrypted  \nsystems or data . \n \nNote : cybersecurity  authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom assess \nthat if the ransomware  criminal business model continues to yield financial returns for \nransomware actors , ransomware incidents  will become more frequent . Every time a ransom is \npaid, it confir ms the viability and financial attractiveness of the ransomware criminal business \nmode l. Additionally, c ybersecurity  authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United \nKingdom note that the criminal business model often complicates  attribution because there \nare complex network s of developers, affiliates , and freelancers; it is often difficult to identify \nconclusively the actors behind a ransomware incident . \n \n Sharing victim information . Eurasian ransomware groups have shared victim in formation \nwith each other , diversifying the threat to targeted organi zations . For example, after \nannouncing its shutdown, the BlackMatter ransomware  group transferred its existing victims to  \ninfrastructure owned by another group , known as Lockbit 2.0 . In October 2021, Conti \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 3 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    ransomware  actors began selling access to victims networks, enabling follow -on attacks by \nother cyber threat actors.  \n Shifting away from big-game hunting  in the United States .  \no In the first half of 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States  and Australia \nobserved ransomware threat actors  targeting big game organizations i.e., perceived \nhigh-value organizations and/or those that provide critical services in several high -\nprofile incidents . These victims include d Colonial Pipeline  Company , JBS Foods, and \nKaseya  Limited . However, ransomware groups  suffered disruptions from U.S. \nauthorities in mid -2021. Subsequently , the FBI observed some ransomware threat \nactors  redirecting ransomware efforts away from big-game  and toward mid -sized \nvictims  to reduce scrutiny .  \no The ACSC observed ransomware  continuing to target Australian organizations of all \nsizes, including critical services and big game,  throughout 2021 .  \no NCSC -UK observed targeting of  UK organizations of all sizes throughout the year, with \nsome big game victims. Overall vict ims included businesses, charities, the legal \nprofession, and public services in the Education, Local Government, and Health \nSectors . \n Diversifying approaches to extorting money . After encrypting victim networks, ransomware \nthreat actors  increasingly used triple  extortion by threatening to  (1) publicly release stolen \nsensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim s internet access, and /or (3) inform the victims \npartners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident. The ACSC continued to observe \ndouble extortion  incidents in which  a threat actor  uses  a combination of encryption and data \ntheft to pressure victims to pay ransom demands .  \nRansomware groups have increased their impact by:  \n Targeting the cloud . Ransomware developers target ed cloud infrastruct ures to exploit known \nvulnerabilities in cloud applications , virtual  machine software, and virtual  machine \norchestration software. Ransomware threat actors  also targeted cloud accounts, cloud  \napplication programming interfaces  (APIs ), and data backup and storage systems to deny \naccess to cloud resources and encrypt  data. In addition to exploiting weaknesses  to gain \ndirect access, threat a ctors sometimes reach cloud storage systems by compromising local \n(on-premises) devices and moving later ally to the cloud systems. Ransomware threat actors  \nhave also target ed cloud service providers to encrypt large amounts of customer data.  \n Targeting managed service providers . Ransomware threat actors have targeted managed \nservice providers (MSPs). MSP s have widespread and trusted accesses into client \norganizations. By compromising an MSP , a ransomware threat actor  could  access multiple \nvictims through one initial compromise . Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, \nAustralia, and the United Kingd om assess there will be an increase  in ransomware incidents \nwhere threat actors target MSPs to reach their clients . \n Attacking industrial processes . Although most ransomware incidents against critical \ninfrastructure affect business information and technolog y systems,  the FBI observed  that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 4 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    several ransomware groups have developed code designed to stop critical infrastructure or \nindustrial processes.  \n Attacking the software supply chain . Globally, in 2021 , ransomware threat actors  targeted \nsoftware supply chain  entities to subsequently compromise and extort their customers. \nTargeting software supply chains allows ransomware threat actors  to increase the scale of \ntheir attacks by accessing multiple victims through a single initial compromise.  \n Targeting organizat ions on  holidays and weekend s. The FBI and CISA observed \ncyber criminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holiday s and  \nweekends  throughout 2021. Ransomware threat actors  may view holidays and weekends \nwhen offices are normally closed as attractive timeframes , as there are fewer network \ndefenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. For more information, see joint \nFBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory , Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends . \nMITIGATIONS  \nCybersecurity authorities in the United States , Australia, and the United Kingdom  recommend  \nnetwork defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware \nincidents : \n Keep all operating systems  and software up to date . Timely patching is one of the most \nefficient and cost -effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to \ncybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software update s and end of  life (EOL) notifications, \nand prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities . In cloud environments, ensure that \nvirtual machines, serverless application s, and third -party libraries  are also patched regularly, \nas doing so is usually the customers responsibility . Automate software security scanning and \ntesting when possible.  Consider upgrading hardware and software , as necessary,  to take \nadvantage of  vendor -provided  virtua lization and security capa bilities . \n If you use RDP or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor  them  closely . \no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and \nusing virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed \noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA  to mitigate \ncredential theft and reuse . If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private \nnetwork (VPN) , virtual desktop infrastructure,  or other means to authenticate and \nsecure the connection  before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices . Monitor \nremote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of \nattempts  to block brute  force campaigns , log RDP login attempts,  and disable unused \nremote access/RDP ports.  \no Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable \nports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP \nTransmission Control Protocol Port 3389).  \no Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access \nservers that are necessary,  and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB  (i.e., \nSMB version 1) . Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 5 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    o Review the security posture of third -party vendors and those interconnected with your \norganization. Ensure all connections between third -party vendors and outside software \nor hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.  \no Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems \nto execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.  \no Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content \nfrom running.  \n Implement a user training pro gram and phishing exercises  to raise awareness among \nusers about  the risks of visiting suspicious websites , clicking on suspicious  links, and opening \nsuspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and \nspearphishing emails.  \n Require MFA  for as many services as possible particularly for webmail, VPNs , accounts  that \naccess critical systems , and  privileged accounts that manage backups.  \n Require all accounts with password l ogins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and  \ndomain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords . Passwords should not be \nreused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have \naccess. Note : devices with local admin accounts should implement a password policy , \npossibly using a password management solution (e.g., Local Administrator Password Solution  \n[LAPS] ), that requires strong, unique passwords for each admin  account.  \n If using Linux, use a Linux security module (such as SELinux, AppArmor, or SecComp) \nfor defense in depth . The security modules may prevent the operating system from making \narbitrary connections, which is  an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as \nagainst remote code execution (RCE).  \n Protect cloud storage by backing up to multiple locations, requiring MFA  for access, \nand encrypting data in the cloud . If using cloud -based key  management  for encryption, \nensure that storage and key administration roles are separated . \nMalicious cyber actors use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility \nand mapping. To limit an adversary s ability to  learn  an organizations en terprise environment  and to \nmove laterally , take the following actions:  \n Segment networks . Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by \ncontrolling traffic flows between and access to various subnetworks and by restricting \nadversary lateral movement.  Organizations with an international footprint should be aware that \nconnectivity between their overseas arms can e xpand their threat surface ; these organizations \nshould implement network segmentation between international divisions where appropriate. \nFor example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which \nAustralian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents \naffecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control).  \n Implement end -to-end encryption . Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can \nprevent eavesdropping on communications, which , in turn , can prevent cyber threat actors \nfrom gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 6 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE     Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the \nindicated ransomware with a network -monitoring tool . To aid in detecting the \nransomware, leverage a tool tha t logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral \nmovement on a network. Endpoint detection and response tools are particularly useful for \ndetecting lateral connections as they have insight into unusual  network connections for each \nhost.  Artificial  intelligence (AI) -enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also \nable to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of \nransomware deployment.  \n Document external remote connections . Organizations should document appr oved \nsolutions for remote management and maintenance. If an unapproved solution is installed on \na workstation, the organization should investigate  it immediately. These solutions have \nlegitimate purposes, so they will not be flagged by antivirus vendors.  \n Implement time -based access for privileged accounts . For example, the just-in-time \naccess method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of \nthe principle of least privilege (as well as the zero trust model)  by setting network -wide policy \nto automatically disable admin accounts at the A ctive Directory  level. As needed, individual \nusers can submit requests through an automated process that enables access to a system for \na set timeframe.  In cloud environments, just -in-time elevation is also appropriate and may be \nimplemented using per -session federated claims or privileged access management tools.  \n Enforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies . Minimize unnecessary \nprivileges for identities. Consider pr ivileges assigned to human identities as well as non -\nperson (e.g. , software) identities. In cloud environments, non -person identities (service \naccounts or roles) with excessive privileges are a key vector for lateral movement  and data \naccess . Account privi leges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and regularly audited \nagainst usage patterns.  \n Reduce credential exposure . Account s and their credentials present on hosts can enabl e \nfurther compromise of a network. Enforcing credential protection by restricting where \naccounts and credentials can  be used and by using local device credential protection \nfeatures reduces opportunities  for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement \nand privilege escalation.  \n Disable unneeded command -line utilities; constrain scripting activities and \npermissions , and monitor their usage . Privilege escalation and lateral movement often \ndepend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run \nthese tools, they will have di fficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.  Organizations \nshould also disable macros sent from external sources via Group Policy.  \n Maintain offline  (i.e., physically disconnected)  backups of data , and regularly test \nbackup and  restoration . These  practices safeguard an organizations continuity of \noperations or at least minimize potential downtime from an attack as well as protect against \ndata losses.  In cloud environments, consider leveraging native cloud service provider backup \nand restoration c apabilities.  To further secure  cloud  backups, consider separation of account \nroles to prevent an account that manages the backups from being used to deny or degrade \nthe backups  should the account become compromised .  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 7 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE     Ensure all backup data is encrypted , immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and \ncovers the entire organizations data infrastructure.  Consider storing encryption keys outside \nthe cloud. Cloud backups that are encrypted using  a cloud key management service (KMS)  \ncould be affected shou ld the cloud environment become compromised.   \n Collect  telemetry from cloud environments . Ensure  that telemetry from cloud  \nenvironments including network telemetry (e.g. , virtual private cloud [ VPC] flow logs), identity \ntelemetry (e.g. , account sign -on, token usage, federation configuration changes), and \napplication telemetry (e.g. , file downloads, cross -organizat ion sharing) is retained and visible  \nto the security team.  \nNote : critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operation al technology \nnetworks should review joint CISA -FBI Cybersecurity Advisory  DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices \nfor Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks  for more recommendation s, including \nmitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall \nvictim to ransomware.   \nRESPONDING TO RANSOM WARE ATTACKS  \nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, cybersecurity authorities in the  United States, \nAustralia, and the United Kingdom  recommend organizations:  \n Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist  on p. 11 of the  CISA -Multi -State Information \nSharing and Analysis Center (MS -ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide . \n Scan backups . If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free \nof malware.  This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing \nbackups to potential compromise.  \n Report incidents  to respective cyber security  authorities:  \no U.S. organizations should r eport incidents immediately  to the FBI at a  local FBI Field \nOffice , CISA at  us-cert.cisa.gov/report , or the U.S. Secret Service at a  U.S. Secret \nService Field Office .  \no Australian organizations  should report incidents to the ASDs ACSC via  cyber.gov.au  \nor call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1).  \no UK organizations  should report incident s to NCSC -UK via report.ncsc.gov.uk  and/or \nAction Fraud, the U nited Kingdom s fraud and cyber reporting centre, via \nactionfraud.police.uk . \n Apply incident response best practices  found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical \nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity , developed by CISA and the \ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.  \nNote : cybersecurity authorities in the United States , Australia, and the United Kingdom  strongly \ndiscourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Criminal activity is motivated  by financial  gain, so \npaying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations  (or re -target the same \norganization)  or encourage cyber criminals  to engage in the distribution of ransomware. Paying the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 8 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    ransom also does not guarantee that a victims files will be recovered.  Additionally, r educing the \nfinancial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the  ransomware  criminal business model.  \nAdditionally, NCSC -UK reminds UK organizations that paying criminals is not condoned by the UK \nGovernment. In instances  where a ransom paid , victim organizations  often cease engagement with \nauthorities , who then lose visibility of the payments made . While it continues to prove challenging , the \nNCSC -UK has supported UK Government efforts  by identifying needed policy changes including \nmeasures about the  cyber insurance industry and  ransom payments that could reduce the threat of \nransomware.  \nRESOURCES  \n For more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware, \nrefer to  StopRansomware.gov , a centralized,  U.S. whole -of-government webpage providing \nransomware resources and alerts.  \n CISAs  Ransomware Readiness Assessment  is a no -cost self -assessment based on a tiered \nset of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and \nrecover from a ransomware incident.   \n CISA offers a range of no -cost cyber hygiene services  to help critical infrastructure \norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By \nrequesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and \nmitigate attack vectors.  \n The U.S. Department of State s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program offers a reward of up to \n$10 million for reports of foreign government malicious activity against U.S. critical \ninfrastructure. See the RFJ website  for more information and how to report information \nsecurely.  \n The ACSC recommends organizations implement eight essential mitigation strategi es from the \nACSCs Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  as a cybersecurity baseline. These \nstrategies, known as the Essential Eight , make it much harder for adversaries to compromise \nsystems . \n Refer to the ACSCs practical guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks  \nand what to do if you are held to ransom  at cyber.gov.au . \n Refer to NCSC -UKs guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks and how \nto respond to and recover fr om them at ncsc.gov.uk/ransomware/home .  \nREFERENCES  \n[1] United States Federal Bureau of Investigation  \n[2] United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  \n[3] United States National Security Agency  \n[4] Australian Cyber Security Centre  \n[5] United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC -UK \n | TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 9 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22 -040A  \nTLP: WHITE    DISCLAIMER  \nThe information in this report is being provided as is for informational purposes only.
