Chinese state -\nsponsored cyber actors aggressively target U.S. \nand allied political, economic, military, \neducational, and critical infrastructure (CI) \npersonnel and organ izations to steal sensitive \ndata, critical and emerging key technologies , \nintellectual property, and personally identifiable \ninformation (PII). S ome target  sectors  include managed service providers, \nsemiconductor companies, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB ), universities, and medical \ninstitutions. These cyber operations support Chinas long -term economic and military \ndevelopment objectives .  \nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides information on tactics, techniques, \nand procedures (TTPs) used by Ch inese state -sponsored cyber actors. This advisory \nbuilds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal, state, local, tribal, \nand territorial (SLTT) government, CI, DIB, and private industry organizations about \nnotable trends and persistent TT Ps through collaborative, proactive, and retrospective \nanalysis.  \nTo increase the defensive posture of their critical networks and reduce the risk of \nChinese malicious cyber activity, NSA, CISA, and FBI urge government, CI, DIB, and \nprivate industry organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations  \nsection of this advisory and in Appendix A: Chinese State -sponsored Cyber Actors' \nObserved Procedures . Note: NSA, CISA, and FBI encourage organization leaders to This advisory uses the MITRE \nAdversarial Tactics, Techniques \nand Common Knowledge \n(ATT&CK) framework, version 9, \nand MITRE D3FEND \nframework, version 0.9.2 -BETA -3. \nSee the ATT&CK for Enterprise \nframework  for all referenced \nthreat actor tactics and \ntechniques and the D3FEND \nframework  for referenced \ndefensive tactics and techniques.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/163624 -21 | PP-21-0971 | JUL 2021 Ver . 1.0   NSA, CISA, & FBI | Chinese State -Sponsored Cyber Operations: Observed TTPs  \n2  \nreview CISA Joint Insights: Chinese Malicious Cyber Activity: Threat Overview for \nLeaders  for information on this th reat to their organization.  \nTechnical Details  \nTrends i n Chinese State -Sponsored Cyber Operations  \nNSA, CISA, and FBI have  observed increasingly sophisticated Chinese state -sponsored \ncyber activity  targeting U.S. political, economic, military, educational,  and CI personnel \nand organizations. NSA, CISA, and FBI have identified the following trends in Chinese \nstate -sponsored malicious cyber operations through proactive and retrospective \nanalysis : \n Acquisition of Infrastructure and Capabilities. Chinese state -sponsored cyber \nactors remain agile and cognizant of the information security communitys \npractices. These actors take effort to mask their activities by using a revolving \nseries of virtual private servers (VPSs) and common open -source or com mercial \npenetration tools.  \n Exploitation of Public Vulnerabilities. Chinese state -sponsored cyber actors \nconsistently scan target networks for critical and high vulnerabilities within days \nof the vulnerabilitys public disclosure. In many cases, these cybe r actors seek to \nexploit vulnerabilities in major applications, such as Pulse Secure, Apache, F5 \nBig-IP, and Microsoft products. For information on Common Vulnerabilit ies and \nExposures (CVE) known to be exploited by malicious Chinese state -sponsored \ncyber actors, see:  \n CISA -FBI Joint CSA AA20 -133A: Top 10 Routinely Exploited \nVulnerabilities , \n CISA Activity Alert: AA20 -275A: Potential for China Cyber Response to \nHeightened U.S. -China Tensions , and  \n NSA CSA U/OO/179811 -20: Chinese State -Sponsored Actors Exploit \nPublic ly Known Vulnerabilities  \n Encrypted Multi -Hop Proxies. Chinese state -sponsored cyber  actors have \nbeen routinely observed using a VPS as an encrypted proxy. The cyber actors \nuse the VPS as well as small office and home office (SOHO) devices as \noperational no des to evade detection.  \n\n \n \n \nU/OO/163624 -21 | PP-21-0971 | JUL 2021 Ver . 1.0   NSA, CISA, & FBI | Chinese State -Sponsored Cyber Operations: Observed TTPs  \n3  \nObserved Tactics and Techniques  \nChinese state -sponsored cyber actors use a full array of tactics and techniques to \nexploit computer networks of interest worldwide and to acquire sensitive intellectual \nproperty, economic, political, and military information. Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK \nFramework  lists the tactics and techniques used by Chinese state -sponsored cyber \nactors. A downloadable JSON file  is also av ailable on the NSA Cybersecurity GitHub \npage . \nRefer to Appendix A: Chinese State -Sponsored Cyber Actors Observed Procedures  for \ninformation on procedures affiliated with t hese tactics and techniques as well as \napplicable mitigations . \n \nFigure 1: Example of tactics and techniques used in various cyber operations.\nMitigations  \nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge federal and SLTT government, CI, DIB, and private industry \norganizations to apply the following recom mendations as well as the detection  and \nmitigation  recommendations in Appendix A , which are tailored to observed tactics and \ntechniques : \n Patch systems and equipment promptly and diligently.  Focus on patching \ncritical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial -of-\nservice on externally facing equipment and CVEs known to be exploited by \n\n\n \n \n \nU/OO/163624 -21 | PP-21-0971 | JUL 2021 Ver . 1.0   NSA, CISA, & FBI | Chinese State -Sponsored Cyber Operations: Observed TTPs  \n4  \nChinese state -sponsored cyber actors. Consider implementing a patch \nmanagement p rogram that enables a timely and thorough patching cycle.  \nNote : for more information on CVEs routinely exploited by Chinese state -\nsponsored cyber actors refer to the resources listed in the Trends in Chinese \nState -Spon sored Cyber Operations  section.  \n Enhance monitoring of network traffic, email , and endpoint systems.  \nReview network signatures and indicators for focused activities, monitor for new \nphishing themes, and adjust email rules accordingly. Follow the best practi ces of \nrestricting attachments via email and blocking URLs and domains based upon \nreputation. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable \nmaximum detection capabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse. \nMonitor common p orts and protocols for command and control (C2) activity. \nSSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to \nlook for network -based indicators of malware communication protocols. \nImplement and enhance network and endpoint event ana lysis and detection \ncapabilities to identify initial infections, compromised credentials , and the \nmanipulation of endpoint processes and files.  \n Use protection capabilities to stop malicious activity.  Implement anti -virus \nsoftware and other endpoint protect ion capabilities to automatically detect and \nprevent malicious files from executing. Use a network intrusion detection and \nprevention system to identify and prevent commonly employed adversarial \nmalware and limit nefarious data transfers. Use a domain repu tation service to \ndetect suspicious or malicious domains. Use strong credentials for service \naccounts and multi -factor authentication (MFA) for remote access  to mitigate an \nadversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of MFA \ninterceptio n techniques for some MFA implementations.  \nResources  \nRefer to us-cert.cisa.gov/china , https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts , and https://www.nsa.gov/What -\nWe-Do/Cybersecurity/Advisories -Technical -Guidance/  for previous reporting on Chinese state -sponsored \nmalicious cyber activity.  \nWorks Cited  \n[1] FireEye  (2020), This is Not a Test: APT41 Initiates Global Intrusion Campaign Using Multiple \nExploits.
