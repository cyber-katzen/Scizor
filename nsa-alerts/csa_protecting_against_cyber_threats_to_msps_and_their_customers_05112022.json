[1] This joint \nCybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides actions  MSPs and \ntheir customers  can take to reduce their risk of falling victim  \nto a cyber intrusion.  \nThis advisory  describes  cybersecurity  best practices for \ninformation and communications technology (ICT)  services \nand functions , focusing on guidance that enables \ntransparent discussions between MSPs and their customers \non securing sensitive data. Organiz ations should implement \nthese guidelines as appropriate to their unique environments, in accordance with their specific security \nneeds, and in compliance with applicable regulations. MSP  \ncustomers should verify that the contractual arrangements with their provider include cybersecurity \nmeasures  in line with the ir particular  security requirements .  \nThe guidance provided in this advisory is specifically tailored for both MSPs and their customers  and \nis the result of a collaborative effort from the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC -\nUK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Cent re (NCSC -NZ), the United States' Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) with contributions from industry members of the Jo int Cyber Defense Collaborative Tactical a ctions for MSPs and \ntheir customers to take today:  \n Identify and disable \naccounts  that are no \nlonger in use. \n Enforce MFA on MSP \naccounts that access the \ncustomer environment and \nmonitor for unexplained \nfailed authentication.  \n Ensure  MSP -customer  \ncontracts transparently \nidentify ownership of ICT \nsecurity roles and \nresponsibilities.  \n\n \n   Product ID : AA2 2-131A  \n TLP:WHITE  \nPage 2 of 3  |  Product ID: AA2 2-131A  \nTLP: WHITE  (JCDC) . Organizations should read this advisory in conjunction with NCSC -UK guidance on actions to \ntake when the cyber threat is heightened , CCCS guidance on Cyber Security Considerations for \nConsumers of Managed Services , and CISA  guidance provided on the Shields Up and Shields Up \nTechnical Guidance webpages . \nManaged  Service Providers  \nThis advisory  defines  MSP s as entities that deliver, operate,  or manage ICT services and functions  \nfor their customers  via a contractual arrangement, such as a service level agreement.  In addition to \noffering their own services, an MSP may offer services in conjunction with those of other providers.  \nOfferings may include platform , software, and IT infrastructure services; business process and \nsupport functions; and c ybersecurity services. MSPs typically manage these services and functions in \ntheir customer's network environmenteither on the customer's premises or hosted in the MSP's \ndata center.  Note:  this advisory does not address guidance on cloud service providers ( CSPs )\nproviders who handle the IC T needs of their customers via cloud services such as Software-as -a-\nService, Platform -as-a-Service , and Infrastructure-as -a-Service ; however, MSPs may offer these \nservices as well . (See Appendix  for additional definitions.)  \nMSPs provide services that usually require both trusted network connectivity and privileged access to \nand from customer systems.  Many  organizations ranging from large critical infrastructure \norganizations  to small - and mid-sized businesses use MSPs to manage IC T systems, store data, or \nsupport sensitive process es. Many organizations make use of MSPs to scale and support network \nenvironments and processes without expanding their internal staff or having to develop the capabilities internally . \n \nThreat Actors Targeting MSP Access to Customer Networks  \nWhether the customer's network environment is on premises or externally hosted, threat actors can \nuse a vulnerable MSP as an initial access vector  to multiple victim networks , with globally cascading \neffects . The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities  expect \nmalicious cyber actors including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to step \nup their targeting of MSPs in their efforts to exploit provider -customer network trust relationships . For \nexample, threat actors successfully compromising an MSP could enabl e follow -on activity such as \nransomware  and cyber espionage against the MSP  as well as across the  MSP's  customer  base. \nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities  have previously \nissued general guidance for MSPs  and their customers .[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] This advisory provid es \nspecific guidance to enable transparent, well -informed discussions betw een MSPs  and their \ncustomers that center on securing sensitive information and data. These discussions  should result in \na re-evaluation of security processes and contractual commitments to accommodate customer risk \ntolerance. A shared commitment to security will reduce risk for  both MSPs  and their customers, as \nwell as the global  ICT community .  \nRECOMM ENDATIONS  \nMSP s and their Customers  \nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities  recommend MSPs  \nand their customers  implement the baseline security measures  and operational controls listed in this \n\n \n   Product ID : AA2 2-131A  \n TLP:WHITE  \nPage 3 of 4  |  Product ID: AA2 2-131A  \nTLP: WHITE  section.  Additionally, customers should ensure their contractual arrangements specify  that their  MSP  \nimplements these measures and controls.  \nPrevent initial compromise.  \nIn their efforts to compromise MSP s, malicious cyber actors exploit vulnerable devices  and internet-\nfacing services , conduct brute force attacks, and use phis hing techniques . MSPs  and their customers  \nshould ensure they are mitigating these attack methods . Useful mitigation resources on initial \ncompromise attack methods are listed below : \n Improve security of v ulnerable devices . \no Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions  (CISA, NSA)  \no Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Services  (NCSC-UK)  \n Protect i nternet-facing services . \no Protecting internet-facing services on public service Critical National Infrastructure \n(CNI) (NCSC -UK) \no Strategies for protecting web application systems against credential stuffing attacks  \n(CCCS)  \n Defend against brute force and password spraying.  \no Microsoft update on brute force and password spraying activity  (NCSC-UK)  \no Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise \nand Cloud Environments  (NSA, CISA, FBI, NCSC -UK) \n Defend against phishing . \no Phishing attacks: defending your organisation (NCSC -UK) \no Spotting malicious email messages  (CCCS)  \nEnable /improve monitoring and logging processes.   \nIt can be months before incidents are detected,  so UK, Austra lian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. \ncybersecurity authorities  recommend  all organizations  store their most important logs for at least six \nmonths. Whether through a comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM) \nsolution or discrete loggi ng tools, implement and maintain a segregated logging regime to detect \nthreats to networks. Organizations  can refer to the following NCSC -UK guidance on the appropriate \ndata to collect for security purposes  and when to use it: What exactly should we be logging?.  \nAdditionally, all organizations whether through contractual arrangements with an MSP or on their \nownshould implement endpoint detection and network defens e monitoring capabilities in addition to \nusing application allow listing/denylisting.  \n MSPs  should log the delivery infrastructure activities used to provide services to the customer . \nMSPs should also log both internal and customer network activity , as appropriate and \ncontractually agreed upon.   \n Customers should enable effective monitoring and logging o f their systems . If customers \nchoose to engage an MSP to perform monitoring and logging, they should ensure that their \ncontractual arrangements  require their MSP  to: \no Implement comprehensive security event management that enables appropriate \nmonitoring and logging of provider -managed customer systems ;  \no Provide visibility as specified in the contractual arrangementto customers of \nlogging activities , including provider's presence, activities, and connections to the \n\n \n   Product ID : AA2 2-131A  \n TLP:WHITE  \nPage 4 of 5  |  Product ID: AA2 2-131A  \nTLP: WHITE  customer networks  (Note:  customers should ensure that MSP accounts  are properly \nmonitored and audited.) ; and \no Notify customer of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on \nthe providers infrastructure and administrative networks , and send these to a  security \noperations center  (SOC ) for analysis and triage.  \nEnforce multifactor authentication  (MFA) .  \nOrganizations should s ecure remote access applications and enforce MFA where possible to harden \nthe infrastructure that enables access to networks and systems. [9],[10]  Note:  Russian state-\nsponsored APT actors  have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols ; \norganizations should review configuration policies to protect against fail open and re-enrollment \nscenarios.[1 1]  \n MSPs should recommend the adoption of MFA across all customer services and products. \nNote: MSPs should also implement MFA on all accounts that have access to customer \nenvironments and should treat those accounts as privileged.  \n Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements mandate the use of MFA on \nthe services and products  they receive.  Contracts should also require MFA to be enforced on \nall MSP accounts used to access customer environments. \nManage internal architecture risks and s egregate internal networks .  \nOrganizations should understand their environment and segregate their networks . Identify, group,  and \nisolate critical business systems and apply appropriate network security controls to them  to reduce \nthe impact of a compromise across  the organi zation. [12],[13] \n MSPs  should r eview and verify all connections between internal systems, customer  systems, \nand other networks . Segregate customer data sets  (and services, where applicable)  from each \nother as well as from  internal company networks to limit the impact of a single vector of \nattack. Do not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.  \n Customers should r eview and verify all connections betw een internal systems, MSP  systems, \nand other networks . Ensure management of identity providers and trusts between the different \nenvironments. Use a dedicated virtual private network (VPN)  or alternative secure access \nmethod, to connect to MSP infrastructur e and limit all network traffic to and from the MSP to \nthat dedicated secure connection. Verify  that the networks used for trust relationships with \nMSPs  are suitably segregated from the rest of their  networks . Ensure contractual agreements \nspecify that MSP s will not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.  \nApply the principle of least privilege .  \nOrganizations should a pply the principle of least privilege throughout their network environment and \nimmediate update privileges upon changes in administrative roles . Use a tiering model for \nadministrative accounts so that these accounts  do not have any unnecessary access or privileges. \nOnly use accounts with full privileges across an enterprise when strictly  necessary  and c onsider the \nuse of time-based privileges to further restrict their use. Identify high-risk devices, services and users \nto minimi ze their accesses .[14] \n MSPs should apply this principle to both internal and customer environments , avoiding default \nadministrative privileges.  \n\n \n   Product ID : AA2 2-131A  \n TLP:WHITE  \nPage 5 of 6  |  Product ID: AA2 2-131A  \nTLP: WHITE   Customers should ensure that their MSP  applies this principle to both provider and customer \nnetwork environments . Note:  customers with contractual arrangements that provide them with \nadministration of MSP accounts within their environment should ensure that the MSP \naccounts only have access to the services/resources being managed by the MSP.  \nDeprecate obsolete accounts and infrastructure .  \nBoth MSPs  and customers  should periodically review their internet attack surface and take steps to \nlimit it, such as  disabling user accounts  when personnel transition. [15] (Note:  although sharing \naccounts is not recommended, should an organization require this, passwords to shared account \nshould be reset when personnel transition.) Organizations should also audit their network \ninfrastructurepaying particular attention to those on the MSP -customer boundary to identify and \ndisable unused systems and services . Port scan ning tools and automated system inventories  can \nassist organizations in confirm ing the roles and responsibilities of systems . \n Customers should be sure to disable MSP accounts that are no longer managing \ninfrastructure. Note: disabling MSP accounts can be overlooked when a contract terminates. \nApply updates .  \nOrganizations should update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware. \nPrioritize applying security updates to software containing known exploited vulnerabilities . Note:  \norganizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities included in CISAs catalogue of known \nexploited vulnerabilities (KEV)  as opposed to only those with high Common Vulnerability Scoring \nSystem (CVSS) scores that have not been exploited and may never be exploited.[ 16],[17],[18],[19] \n MSPs should implement updates on internal networks as quickly as possible.  \n Customers should ensure that they understand the ir MSP 's policy on software updates and \nrequest that comprehensive and timely updates  are delivered as an ongoing service.  \nBackup systems and data.   \nOrganizations should r egularly update and test backups including gold images of critical systems  \nin the event these  need to be rebuilt (Note:  organizations should base the frequency of backups on \ntheir recovery point objective [20]) . Store backups separately and isolate them from network \nconnections that could enable the spread of ransomware; many ransomware variants attempt to find \nand encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of systems/data to their \nprevious state should they be encrypted with ransomware. Note: best practice s include storing \nbackups separately,  such as  on external media. [21],[22],[23]  \n MSPs should r egularly backup internal data as well as customer data (where contractually \nappropriate) and maintain offline backups encrypted with separate, offline encryption keys. \nProviders should encourage customers to create secure, offsite backups and exercise \nrecovery capabilities.  \n Customers should ensure that their contr actual arrangements include backup services that \nmeet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements . Specifically, customers should \nrequire their MSP to implement a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs up critical data and system  configurations and s tore backups in an easily retrievable location, \ne.g., a cloud -based solution or a location that is air -gapped from the organizational network. \n\n \n   Product ID : AA2 2-131A  \n TLP:WHITE  \nPage 6 of 7  |  Product ID: AA2 2-131A  \nTLP: WHITE  Develop  and exercise incident response and recovery plans .  \nIncident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all organizational \nstakeholders, including executives, technical leads, and procurement officers . Organizations should \nmaintain up-to-date hard copies of plans to ensure res ponders can access them should the network \nbe inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware attack).[2 4] \n MSPs should develop and r egularly exercise  internal incident response and recovery plans  \nand encourage customers to do the same.  \n Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include incident response and \nrecovery plans  that meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Customers \nshould ensure these plans are tested at regular intervals.  \nUnderstand and proactively manage supply chain risk .  \nAll organizations should proactively manage ICT supply chain risk across security, legal, and \nprocurement groups, using risk assessments to identify and prioritize the allocation of \nresources.[ 25],[26] \n MSPs should understand their own supply chain risk  and manage the cascading risk s it poses \nto customers . \n Customers should understand the supply chain risk associated with their MSP , including risk \nassociated with third-party vendors or subcontractors . Customers should also set clear \nnetwork security expectations with their MSPs and  understand the access their MSP has to \ntheir network and the data it houses. Each c ustomer  should ensure their contractual \narrangements meet their specific security requirements  and that their contract specifies \nwhether the MSP or the customer owns specific responsibilities, such as hardening, detection, and incident response. [27] \nPromote transparency .  \nBoth MSPs and their customers will benefit from  contractual arrangements that clearly define \nresponsibilities.  \n MSPs,  when negotiating the terms of a contract  with their customer , should provide clear \nexplanations of the services the customer is purchasing, services  the customer is not \npurchasing, and all contingencies for incident response and recovery.  \n Customers should ensure that they have a thorough  understanding of the  security services  \ntheir MSP is providing via the contractual arrangement and address any secur ity \nrequirements that fall outside the scope of the contract. Note: contracts should detail how and \nwhen MSPs notify the customer of an incident affecting the customer's environment. \nManage account authentication  and authorization.  \nAll organizations shoul d adhere to best practices for password and permission management. \n[28],[29],[30]  Organizations should review logs for unexplained failed authentication attempts failed \nauthentication attempts directly following an account password change could indicate that the account \nhad been compromised. Note:  network defenders can proactively search for such \"intrusion canaries\" \nby reviewing logs after performing password changes usin g off-network communications to inform \nusers of the changes across all sensitive accounts.

Grant access and \nadministrative permissions on a need-to-know basis, using the principle of least privilege. \nVerify , via audits, that MSP accounts are being used for appropriate purposes  and activities , \nand that the se accounts  are disabled when not actively being used.  \nPURPOSE  \nThis advisory was developed by UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity \nauthorities in furtherance their respective cybersecurity missions, including their responsibilities to \ndevelop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nThe UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities would like to \nacknowledge Secure works for their contributions to this CSA.  \nDISCLAIMER  \nThe information in this report is being provided as is for informational purposes only.

The term MSP traditionally \nwas applied to infrastructure or device-centric types of services but has expanded to \ninclude any continuous, regular management, maintenance and support.  \nThe United Kingdom's Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS)  recently published \nthe following definition of MSP , which includes  examples:  \nManaged Service Provider  - A supplier that delivers a portfolio of IT services to business \ncustomers via ongoing support and active administration, all of which are typically \nunderpinned by a Service Level Agreement. A Managed Service Provider may provide \ntheir own Managed Services or offer their own services in conjunction with other IT \nproviders services. The Managed Services might include:  \n Cloud computing services (resale of cloud services, or an in-\nhouse public and private cloud services, built and provided by the \nManaged Service Providers)  \n Workplace services  \n Managed Network  \n Consulting  \n Security services  \n Outsourcing  \n Service Integration and Management \n Software Resale  \n Software Engineering  \n Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  \n Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery  services  \nThe Managed Services might be delivered from customer premises, from customer data \ncentres, from Managed Service Providers own data centres or from 3rd party facilities \n(co-location facilities, public cloud data centres or network Points of Pres ence (PoPs)).  \n\n",
