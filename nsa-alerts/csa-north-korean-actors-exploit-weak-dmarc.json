Without properly \nconfigured DMARC policies, malicious cyber actors are able to send spoofed emails as if they came \nfrom a legitimate domains email exchange.  \nThe North Korean cybe r actors have conducted spearphishing campaigns posing as legitimate \njournalists, academics, or other experts in East Asian affairs with credible links to North Korean \npolicy circles.  North Korea leverages these spearphishing campaigns to collect intellige nce on \ngeopolitical events, adversary foreign policy strategies, and any information affecting North Korean  \ninterests by gaining illicit access to targets private documents, research, and communications.  \nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory ( CSA) includes in dicators of North Korean social engineering \n(page 4) for potential victims receiving spearphishing emails as well as mitigation measures (page 9) \nfor organizations who could be victims of North Korean impersonation.

The United States Government (USG) has observed sustained information -gathering \nefforts originating from North Korean cyber actors. North Koreas premier military inte lligence \norganization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), which has been sanctioned by the United \nNations Security Council, is primarily responsible for this network of actors and activities. The \nauthoring agencies of this advisory assess the princip al goals of North Koreas regime cyber program \ninclude maintaining consistent access to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea, \nand other countries of interest to impede any perceived political, military, or economic threat to the \nregime s security and  stability.  \nThe USG and private sector cybersecurity companies currently track the specific set of North Korean \ncyber actors conducting these large -scale social engineering campaigns as Kimsuky, Emerald Sleet, \nAPT43, Velvet Chollima, and Bla ck Banshee (herein referred to as Kimsuky). Kimsuky is \nadministratively subordinate to the 63rd Research Center, an element within North Koreas RGB, and \nhas conducted broad cyber campaigns in support of RGB objectives since at least 2012. Kimsuky \nactors primary mission is to provide stolen data and valuable geopolitical insight to the North Korean \nregime by compromising policy analysts and other experts. Successful compromises further enable \nKimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spearphishin g emails, which can then be \nleveraged against more sensitive, higher -value targets.  \nThe authoring agencies seek to bring awareness of these campaigns to degrade or minimize the \neffectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. This advisory  provides detai led information on \nhow Kimsuky actors exploit DMARC policies; red flags to consider when encountering common \nthemes and campaigns; and general mitigation measures for entities worldwide to implement to \nbetter protect against Kimsukys computer network expl oitation (CNE) operations.  \nKIMSUKYS  OPERATIONS : DMARC P OLICY  NOT ENABLED  \nDMARC is an email security protocol that authenticates whether an email message seemingly sent \nfrom an organizations domain was legitimately sent from that organizations domain. A DMARC \npolicy can be configured and applied to a domain to specify actions to be taken when email \nauthentication fails. When an organization securely configures a DMARC policy, it helps ensure \nmalicious actors, like Kimsuky, are unable to spoof the organiza tions legitimate email domain when \nsending spearphishing messages to a target. A DMARC policy tells a receiving email server what to \ndo with the email after checking a domains Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys \nIdentified Mail (DKIM) records.  Depending on if an email passes or fails SPF and DKIM, the email \ncan be marked as spam, blocked, or delivered to an intended recipients inbox.1 \n \n1 SPF and DKIM are additional email authentication methods that separately provide layers of security on which  \nDMARC protocols also rely. Together, DMARC, DKIM, and SPF function like a background check on email \nsenders, to make sure they really are who they appear to be. Email servers can mark emails as spam if there is \nno DMARC record, but DMARC provides clearer instructions on when to do so.  \n  \n\nFBI | State  | NSA TLP:CLEAR  \nPage 3 of 9 | Product ID:  JCSA -2024 0502 -001 \nJCSA -20240502 -001 JCSA -502-001 TLP:CLEAR   \n  \nNorth Korean cyber actors rely on social engineering techniques such as spearphishing the use of \nfabricated emails tailored to deceive a target as their primary vector for initiating a compromise and \ngaining access to a ta rgets device and networks. Kimsuky spearphishing campaigns begin with \nbroad research and preparation, including leveraging open source information to identify potential \ntargets of value and then creating tailored online personas to appear more realistic a nd appealing to \ntheir targets. The cyber actors may also use content from emails of previously compromised email \naccounts to enhance the seeming authenticity of their spoofed emails.  \nIn addition to convincing email message s, Kimsuky cyber actors have been observed creating fake \nusernames and using legitimate domain names to impersonate individuals from trusted organizations, \nincluding think tanks and higher education institutions, to gain trust and build rapport with email \nrecipients. Spoofed emails do not come from the trusted organizations actual domain email \nexchange, but rather from the actor -controlled email address and domain. Even if a skeptical recipient  \nwanted to verify whether the sender was legitimate, the recipient email response would be sent b ack \nto a spoofed email address at the trusted domain. The reply -to section of the email header would \nreveal the North Korean actor -controlled email address and domain, but it would still appear to be \nlegitimate.  \nThe sample emails  beginning on page 5  are real unedited examples of Kimsuky spearphishing \nattempts reported to the USG and contain spelling and other errors. The email headers of each \nsample are real excerpts that illustrate how technical analysis can be conducted. The names of \nindividuals and imp acted entities have been redacted.  \n \nIf you believe you have been targeted in one of these spearphishing campaigns, whether or \nnot it resulted in a compromise (particularly if you are a member of one of the targeted \nsectors), please file a report with www.ic3.gov  and reference #KimsukyCSA in the incident \ndescription.  \nPlease include as much detail as you can about the incident including the sender email \naddress and the text of the email message, specifying and links/UR Ls/domains. Please \nspecify whether you responded to the email, clicked on any links, or opened any \nattachments. Please retain the original email and attachments in case you are contacted by \nan investigator for further information.  \n Please visit  www.ic3.gov  and use #KimsukyCSA in your  submission.  \n The U.S. Government also encourages victims to report suspicious activities, \nincluding any suspected North Korean cyber activities, to local FBI field  offices.  \n\nFBI | State  | NSA TLP:CLEAR  \nPage 4 of 9 | Product ID:  JCSA -2024 0502 -001 \nJCSA -20240502 -001 JCSA -502-001 TLP:CLEAR   \n  \nRED FLAG INDICATORS  \nSector targets should be aware of the following activity that may be indications or behaviors of \nmalicious North Korean cyber actors : \n Innocuous initial communication with no malicious links/attachments, followed by \ncommunications containing malicious links/documents, potentially from a different,  seemingly \nlegitimate, email  address  \n Email content that may include real text of messages recovered from previous  victim \nengagement with other legitimate  contacts  \n Emails in English that have awkward sentence structure and/or incorrect  grammar  \n Emails or communications targeting victims with either direct or indirect knowledge of policy \ninformation, including U.S. and ROK government employees/officials working on North  Korea, \nAsia, China, and/or Southeast Asia matters; U.S. and ROK government employees with high \nclearance levels; and members of the  military  \n Email accounts that are spoofed with subtle incorrect misspellings of legitimate names  and \nemail addresses listed in a university directory or an official  website  \n Malicious documents that require the user to click Enable Macros to view the  document  \n Follow -up emails within 2 -3 days of initial contact if the target does not respond to the initial \nspearphishing  email  \n Emails purporting to be from official sources but sent using unofficial email services, \nidentifiable through the email header information being a slightly incorrect version of  \nan organizations  domain  \n\nFBI | State  | NSA TLP:CLEAR  \nPage 5 of 9 | Product ID:  JCSA -2024 0502 -001 \nJCSA -20240502 -001 JCSA -502-001 TLP:CLEAR   \n  \nSample Email 1:  \nBetween late 2023 and early 2024, North Korean cyber actors sent the following email to USG \nofficials and others at international organizations. Notably, a speaker fee is offered to further entice \nthe recipient. The body of the text also contains basic errors. \n \n \nSubject: [Invitation] US Policy Toward North Korea Conference  \n \n \nDear <name of target expert> , \nI hope you and your family are enjoying a lovely holiday and a restful season.  \nIt is my privilege to invite you to provide a keynote address for an private workshop, hosted by the  \n<name of legitimate think tank>  to discuss the US policy toward North Korea. Given \ndevelopments in North Korea since the collapse of US -DPRK and inter -Korean negotiations in \n2019, as well as the changing strategic environmen t in East Asia, the traditional US approach to \nNorth Korea is unlikely to be effective going forward. It is time to question old assumptions and \nbegin crafting a new strategy/approach that takes into consideration current strategic realities.  \nWe understand  your schedule is quite busy, but we were hoping you could join us at least for the \nthat lunch (12:30 - 1:30pm EST). If you are able to join in person, we would cover your travel and \naccommodations to attend, and can provide you with a modest $500 speaker f ee. If you are not \navailable to join in person, we can accommodate remote participation as well.  \nPlease let me know if might be willing to join us and we can provide more details about the event \nand logistics right away. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  \nAll the best,  \n<name of legitimate think tank staff>  \n\nFBI | State  | NSA TLP:CLEAR  \nPage 6 of 9 | Product ID:  JCSA -2024 0502 -001 \nJCSA -20240502 -001 JCSA -502-001 TLP:CLEAR   \n  \nSample Email Header 1:  \nIn the sample email header below, all referenced portions are highlighted. The email returns a pass \nfor the corresponding SPF and DKIM checks, implying the North Korean actor was successful in \ngaining access to a universitys legitimate email client to s end the email. The DMARC protocol returns \nas fail because the senders email domain presented as the domain of the legitimate think tank  \ndiffers from the SPF and DKIM records identified as a <legitimate university email host domain> \nand <legitimate univ ersity email account> , respectively. The p=NONE indicates that a DMARC \npolicy was set in which no email filtering action is taken on the message, despite the failed DMARC \nverification. This ultimately allows the spearphishing email to be delivered to the  victims inbox.  \nAdditionally, the North Korean actor edited the Reply -To email to route replies back to another \nseemingly legitimate, but fraudulent, account controlled by the actor.  \nWhile the sender of the email and the organizations email domain appe ar to be legitimate, the North \nKorean cyber actor exploited the organizations weak and overly permissive, rather than specifically \ndefined, DMARC policy that allowed the North Korean actor to obfuscate the true sender domain.  \n \n \nARC -Authentication -Results : i=l; mx.google.com  \ndkim =pass  header.i= <legitimate university email account> header.s=defauIt \nheader.b=pUMk3rBI;  \nspf=pass  (google.com: domain of <legitimate university email host domain> \ndesignates <IP address associated with university email host domain>  as \npermitted sender) smtp.mailfrom= <legitimate university email host domain> ; \ndmarc =fail (p=none  sp=none  dis=none ) header.from= <spoofed domain of think tank>  \n \nReceived: from evanger8 by box2239.bluehost.com with local (Exim 4.96.2)  \n(envelope -from <evanger8@box2239.bluehost.com >) id lrKTlk -OOOEeX -36 for <experts \nreceiving email> ; Mon, 01 Jan 2024 18:40:37 -0700  \nTo: <experts receiving email>  \nSubject: [Invitation]  \nX-PHP-Script: <legitimate univer sity email account> /move/send/fooe.php for 59.6.130.254, \n59.6.130.254 X -PHP-Originating -Script: 1171:mail.php  \nMIME -Version: 1.0  \nContent -Type: text/html; charset=utf -8 Content -Transfer -Encoding: quoted -printable \nFrom: <email address of legitimate think tank > \nCc: \nReply -To: <name of legitimate think tank staff> <spoofed account of legitimate think tank staff>  \n\nFBI | State  | NSA TLP:CLEAR  \nPage 7 of 9 | Product ID:  JCSA -2024 0502 -001 \nJCSA -20240502 -001 JCSA -502-001 TLP:CLEAR   \n  \nSample Email 2:  \nIn November 2023, the authoring agencies received spearphishing reports of a North Korean cyber \nactor posing as a legitima te journalist and seeking comment from an expert on North Korea issues. \nImportantly, the North Korean actor openly notes they will not have access to the sending account \nand requests responses be sent to a fake personal account of the legitimate journalist . This novel \ntactic offers victims a plausible reason to respond to the alternative fake account.  \n \n \nSubject: [ <name of legitimate news media outlet> ] Questions about N. Korea \nDear <name of target expert> , \nI hope this email finds you well. This is <name of legitimate journalist> from <name of legitimate \nnews media outlet> . I'm writing to request that you consider granting us a brief interview.  \nNorth Korea is accelerating its sprint towards nuclear armament. After the breakdown of the 2019 \nTrump -Kim Hanoi Summit, Pyongyang has focused on intensifying North Korean nuclear and \nmissile capabilities while rebuffing calls from the international community to resume \ndenuclearization talks. North Korea has not only attempted to agitate the U.S. by drastically  \nescalating its development of strategic nuclear weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles \n(ICBMs), but also wielded threats against the Republic of Korea and Northeast Asia in the form of \ntactical nuclear weapons development. Furthermore, in Sep tember 2022, North Korean leadership \nannounced a new \"law on state policy on nuclear weapons,\" thereby lowering its threshold for \nnuclear weapons employment. Among countries that possess or aim to possess nuclear weapons, \nNorth Korea is alone jn openly exp ressing that the use of such weapons lie in national defense and \ndeterrence, but in belligerent employment against any specific country. On this basis, North Korea \nhas continued to openly pressure the Republic of Korea and the international community, and pose \na real and present threat to security in the Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia.  \nIn connection with this, I would like to get your opinions about some questions. If interested, please \nrespond to this email at your earliest convenience.  \nThen, I  will send you the questions soon. Thanks for your consideration and time. \nBest regards,  \n<name of legitimate journalist>  \nP.S. One thing: my <name of legitimate news media outlet> account will be blocked temporarily \nsoon. So, I will receive the emails on my  personal account  (<spoofed account of compromised \njournalist> ) for a while. Sorry for troubling you and hope you understand.

The North Korean actor spoofed \nboth the name of a legitimate journalist and the real email domain of that journalists news media \noutlet as given in the From and Sender portions of the emails header information.

These mitigations align with \nthe Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) devel oped by CISA and the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and \nprotections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the \nCPGs on existing cybersecurity framewo rks and guidance to protect against the most common and \nimpactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISAs Cross -Sector Cybersecurity  \nPerformance Goals  for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline \nprotection s. For email security specifically, CPG 2.M  recommends enabling DMARC and setting it to \nreject.  \nMissing DMARC policies or DMARC policies with p=none indicate that the receiving email server \nshould take no security action on emails that fail DMARC check s and allow the emails to be sent \nthrough to the recipients inbox. In order for organizations to make their policy stricter and signal to \nemail servers to consider unauthenticated emails as spam, the authoring agencies recommend \nmitigating this threat by updating your organizations DMARC policy to one of these two \nconfigurations:  \n v=DMARC1;  p=quarantine;  \np=quarantine indicates that email servers should quarantine emails that fail DMARC, considering \nthem to be probable spam.  \n v=DMARC1;  p=reject;  \np=reject instructs email servers to block emails that fail DMARC, considering them to be almost \ncertainly spam.  \nIn addition to setting the p field in DMARC policy, the authoring agencies recommend organizations \nset other DMARC policy fields , such as r ua to receive aggregate reports about the DMARC results \nfor email messages purportedly from the organizations domain.  \nDISCLAIMER  \nThe information in this report is being provided as is for informational purposes only.
