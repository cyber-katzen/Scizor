IRGC -affiliated cyber actors using the persona CyberAv3ngers are actively \ntargeting and compromising  Israel i-made  Unitronics Vision Series programmable logic controllers \n(PLCs). These PLCs are commonly used in the Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) Sector  and \nare additionally used in other industries including , but not limited to , energy, food and beverage \nmanufacturing, and healthcare. The PLCs may be rebranded and appear as  different manufacturers \nand companies. In addition to the recent CISA Alert , the authoring agencies  are releasing this joint \nCSA to share indicators of compromise (IOCs)  and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  \nassociated with IRGC cyber operations . \nSince at least November  22, 2023 , these IRGC -affiliated cyber actors have continued to compromis e \ndefault credentials in  Unitronics devices. The IRGC -affiliated cyber actors left a defacement image \nstating , You have been hacked, down with Israel. Every equipment made in Israel is CyberAv3ngers \nlegal target.  The victims span  multiple U .S. states . The authoring agencies  urge all organizations, Actions  to take today  to mitigate \nmalicious activity : \n Implement multifactor \nauthentication.  \n Use strong, unique \npasswords.  \n Check PLCs for default \npasswords . \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 2 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n especially critical infrastructure organizations, to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations  \nsection of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from these IRGC -affiliated cyber actor s. \nThis advisory provides observed IOCs and TTPs the authoring agencies  assess are likely associated \nwith this IRGC -affiliated APT. For more information on Iranian state -sponsored malicious cyber \nactivity, see CISAs Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  webpage and the FBIs Iran Threat  \nwebpage.  \nFor a downloadable c opy of IOCs, see:  \n AA23 -335A  (STIX XML, 16KB) \n AA23 -335A  (STIX JSON, 11KB) \nTECHNICAL DETAILS  \nNote:  This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise  framework, version 1 4. See Table 1  for \nthreat actor activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.  For assistance with map ping \nmalicious cyber activity  to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA  and MITRE ATT&CKs Best \nPractices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  and CISAs Decider Tool . \nOverview  \nCyberAv3ngers (a lso known as CyberAveng3rs, Cyber Avengers ) is a n Iranian IRGC  cyber persona \nthat has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against critical infrastructure \norganizations. [1],[2],[3],[4],[5] The group claimed responsibility for cyberattacks in Israel beginning in \n2020. CyberAv3ngers falsely claimed they compromise d several critical infrastructure organizations in \nIsrael.[2] CyberAv3ngers also reportedly has connections to another IRGC -linked group known as \nSoldiers of Solomon.  \n(Updated December 1 4, 2023)  Most rec ently, CyberAv3ngers  began targeting U.S. -based WWS \nfacilities that operate Unitronics PLCs .[1] The threat actor s compromis ed Unitronics Vision Series \nPLCs with human machine interfaces (HMI). These compromised devices were publicly exposed to \nthe internet with default password s and by default are on TCP port 20256.  On December 11, 2023, \nCVE-2023-6448  was assigned to address the default pa sswords [CWE -798: Use of Hard Coded \nCredentials ], and  CISA added the CVE to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog . On December \n12, Unitronics released VisiLogic version  9.9.00  software  to address this CVE; the update r equires \nusers to change d efault passwords.  \nThese PLC and related controllers are often exposed to outside internet connectivity due to the \nremote nature of their control and monitoring functionalities.  The compromise i s centered around \ndefacing the controllers user interface and may render the PLC inoperative. With this type of access, \ndeeper device and network level accesses are available and could render additional, more profound \ncyber physical effects on processes a nd equipment. It is not known if additional cyber activities \ndeeper into these PLCs or related control networks and components w ere intended or achieved. \nOrganizations should consider and evaluate their systems for these possibilities.  \n \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 3 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n Threat Actor Activity  \nThe authoring agencies  have observed the IRGC -affiliated  activity since at least October 2023 , when \nthe actors  claimed credit for the cyberattacks against Israeli PLCs  on their Telegram channel . Since \nNovember 2023, the authoring agencies  have obs erved  the IRGC -affiliated actors  target multiple \nU.S.-based WWS facilities that operate Unitronics Vision Series PLCs. Cyber threat actors likely \ncompromised these PLCs since the PLCs were internet -facing and used Unitronics default password. \nObserved act ivity includes the following:  \n Between September 13 and Oc tober 30, 2023, the CyberAv3ngers Telegram channel \ndisplayed  both legitimate and false claims of multiple cyberattacks against Israel. \nCyberAv3ngers targeted Israeli PLCs in the water, energy, shipping, and distribution  sectors.  \n On October 18, 2023, the CyberAv3ngers -linked Soldiers of Solomon claimed  responsibility \nfor compromising  over 50 servers, security cameras, and smart city management systems in \nIsrael ; however , majority of these cl aims were proven false . The group claimed to use a \nransomware named Crucio  against servers where the webcams camera software operated \non port 7001.  \n Beginning on November 22, 2023, IRGC cyber actors  accessed multiple U.S. -based WWS \nfacilities t hat operate Unitronics Vision Series PLCs with an HMI likely by compromising  \ninternet -accessible devices with default passwords. The targ eted PLCs displayed the \ndefacement message , You have been hacked, down with Israel . Every equipment made in \nIsrael  is Cyberav3ngers legal target . \nINDICATORS OF COMPRO MISE  \nSee Table 1 for observed  IOCs related to  CyberAv3nger operations . \n(Updated December 1 4, 2023)  \nTable 1: CyberAv3nger  IOCs  \nIndicator  Type  Fidelity  Description  \nBA284A4B508A7ABD8070A427386E93E0  MD5  Suspected  MD5 hash \nassoci ated with \nCrucio \nRansomware  \n66AE21571FAEE1E258549078144325DC9DD\n60303  SHA1  Suspected  SHA1 hash \nassoci ated with \nCrucio \nRansomware  \n440b5385d3838e3f6bc21220caa83b65cd5f361\n8daea676f271c3671650ce9a3  SHA256  Suspected  SHA256 hash \nassoci ated with  \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 4 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n Indicator  Type  Fidelity  Description  \nCrucio \nRansomware  \n \n178.162.227[.]180  IP address  Suspected  Crucio \nRansomware  \n185.162.235[.]206  IP address  Suspected  Crucio \nRansomware  \nMITRE ATT&CK TACTICS  AND TECHNIQUES  \nSee Table 2 for referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory . \nTable 2: Initial Access  \nTechnique Title  ID Use \nBrute  Force \nTechniques  T1110  Threat actors o btain ed login credentials, which they used \nto successfully log  into Unitronics devices and provid e \nroot-level access.  \nMITIGATION S \nThe authoring agencies  recommend critical infrastructure organizations, including WWS sector \nfacilities , implement the  following  mitigations t o improve your organizations cybersecurity posture to \ndefend against  CyberAv3ngers  activity. These mitigations align with the Cross -Sector Cybersecurity \nPerformance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and \nNIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing \ncybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, \ntactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISAs Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals  for \nmore information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.  \nNote:  The below mitigations are based on threat actor activity against Unitronics PLCs but apply to all \ninternet -facing PLCs . \nNetwork Defenders  \nThe cyber threat actors likely accessed the affected device sUnitronics Vision Series PLC s with \nHMIby exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security and ex posure to the \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 5 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n internet. To safeguard  against this threat, the authoring agencies  urge organizations to  consider the \nfollowing : \nImmediate steps to prevent attack:  \n (Updated December 1 4, 2023)  Upgrade  devices to 9.9.00 VisiLogic software, which requires \nusers  to change the default passwords  on PLCs and HMIs.  Use a strong password. For more \ninformation, see  Unitronics blog Unitronics Cybersecurity for Vision and Samba PLC Series  \nand Release notes  for VisiLogic 9.9.00 . \n Disconnect the PLC from the public -facing internet.  \nFollow -on steps to streng then your security posture:  \n Implement multifactor authentication for access to the operational technology ( OT) network  \nwhenever applicable . \n If you require  remote access, implement a firewall and/or virtual private network ( VPN) in front \nof the PLC to control network access. A VPN or gateway device can enable multifactor \nauthentication for remote access even if the PLC does not support multifactor authentication.  \n Create strong backups of the logic and configurations of PLCs to en able fast recovery. \nFamiliarize yourself with factory resets and backup deployment  as prepar ation  in the event of \nransomware activity.  \n Keep your Unitronics and other PLC devices updated with the latest versions by the \nmanufacturer.  \n Confirm third -party vend ors are applying the above recommended countermeasures to \nmitigate exposure of these devices and all installed equipment . \nIn addition, the authoring agencies  recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to \nlimit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce \nthe impact and risk of compromise by cyber threat actors:  \n Reduce risk exposure.  CISA offers a range of services at no cost, including scanning and \ntesting to help organizations reduce exposure t o threats via mitigating attack vectors. CISA \nCyber Hygiene  services can help provide additional review of organizations internet -\naccessible assets. Email vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov  with the subject line, Requesting Cyber \nHygiene Services to get started.  \nDevice Manufacturers  \nAlthough  critical infrastructure organizations using Unitronics (including rebranded Unitronics) PLC \ndevices can take steps to mitigate the risks, it is ultimately the responsibility of the device \nmanufacturer to build products that are secure by design and defaul t. The authoring agencies  urge \ndevice  manufacturers to take ownership of the security outcomes of their customers by following the \nprinciples in  the joint guide Shifting the Ba lance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for \nSecure by Design Software , primarily : \n Do not ship products with default passwords. Instead, either ship products with random initial \npasswords or require users to change the password upon first use . \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 6 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  Do not expose administrative inter faces to the internet by default , and take steps to  introduce \nfriction  should a device be placed in an insecure state.  \n Do not charge extra for basic security features needed to operate the product securely.  \n Support multifactor authentication, including vi a phishing -resist ant methods.  \nBy using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure out of \nthe box without requiring  customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, \npurchasing tiered security software and logs, monitoring, and making  routine updates . \nFor more information on common misconfigurations and guidance on reducing their prevalence, see \njoint advisory NSA and CISA Red and Blue Teams Share Top Ten Cybersecurity Misconfigurations . \nFor more information on secure by design , see CISAs Secure by Design and Default  webpage and \njoint guide . \nVALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  \nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies  recommend exercising, testing, and \nvalidating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE \nATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The a uthoring agencies  recommend testing your \nexisting security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques \ndescribed in this advisory.  \nTo get started:  \n1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 2). \n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.  \n3. Test your technologies against the technique.  \n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies  performance.  \n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance \ndata. \n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the \ndata generated by this process.  \nThe authoring agencies  recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a \nproduction environment to ensure optimal  performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques \nidentified in this advisory.  \nRESOURCES  \n EPA: Cybersecurity for the Water Sector  \n CISA: Water and Wastewater Systems Sector  \n CISA Alert: Exploitation of Unitronics PLCs used in Water and Wastewater Systems  \n CISA: Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  \n FBI: The Iran Threat - Web Page  \n CISA, MITRE: Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  \n CISA: Decider Tool  \n\n \n  CISA | FBI | NSA | EPA  | INCD  \nPage 7 of 7  |  Product ID: AA23 -335A TLP:CLEAR  \n \nTLP:CLEAR  \n  CISA: Cross -Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals  \n CISA: Cyber Hygiene Services  \n CISA: Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk - Principles and Approaches for Secure by \nDesign Software  \n CISA: Secure by Design Alert - How Sof tware Manufacturers Can Shield Web Management \nInterfaces from Malicious Cyber Activity  \n CISA, NSA: NSA and CISA Red and Blue Teams Share Top Ten Cybersecurity \nMisconfigurati ons \n CISA: Secure by Design and Default  \nREPORTING  \nAll organizations should r eport suspicious or criminal activity related to information in this CSA  to \nCISA via CISAs 24/7 Operations Center ( report@cisa.gov  or 888 -282-0870).
