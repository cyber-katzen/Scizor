An increasing reliance on the cloud brings new complexities and security \nchallenges , and as a result, adversaries  are increasingly targeting  these environments .  \nCustomers often  incorrectly assume that the cloud service provider (CSP) manages \nimportant aspect s of safeguarding resources in the cloud that are not the CSPs \nresponsibility . CSPs provide highly automated, software -defined, and application \nprogramming interface ( API)-driven platforms that do what theyre told by customers \nwithout any human oversig ht on the CSP side.  Misconfiguration  and lack of security \ncontrols  are significant risks in cloud environments .  \nBoth the customer and the CSP are accountable for \nsecuring cloud environments. The s hared responsibility \nmodel outlines  the different responsibilities between the \ncustomer and the CSP. Good cloud security results from \nunderstanding those responsibilities and upholding them \nin partnership.  \n \nThe purpose of this cybersecurity information sheet (CSI) \nis to educate and inform t he audience regarding a security \nand compliance cloud framework that outlines the \nresponsibilities of both the CSP and the customer with \nsecuring every aspect of their selected cloud instance.   Both the customer and \nthe CSP are accountable \nfor securing clo ud \nenvironments.  \nOrganizations should \nensure that they are fully \naware of their \nresponsibilities when it \ncomes to selecting the \ncloud service that best \nfits their needs.  \nThree c loud service models  \nCustomers responsibilit ies for the security of their cloud environments will differ greatly \nbased on their choice of cloud service(s). The three main categories of cloud service \nmodels  are:  \n Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS) \n Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) \n\n \nU/OO/ 126062 -24 | PP-24-0580  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0  \n 2 NSA | Uphold the Cloud Share d Responsibility  Model  \n Software as a Service ( SaaS ) \nThe following figure illustrates how the responsibility is divided between the CSP and \nthe customer  for each cloud service model. While r esponsibilities generally follow the \nmodels  identified in this CSI , specific offerings may differ. Organizations shou ld ensure \nthat they are fully aware of their responsibilities when it comes to selecting the cloud \nservice that best fits their needs . [1]  \nWhen using service offerings of all model types, customers typica lly maintain the \nsecurity of their data, endpoints, and accounts, as well as manag e access control \npolicies governing access to cloud resources  in their tenant .  \nIaaS provides a wide range of computer infrastructure resources , such as virtualized \nservers, storage, and network equipment, remov ing the burden of on -premises \ninfrastructure maintenance. In this model, the customer also configures network security \npolicies and maintains  the security of the operating system and applications hosted on \nthe provided infrastructure . The CSP provisions and secures the physical resources for \nthe customer and maintain s \nisolation between custo mers.  \nPaaS provides customers \nplatforms built from software, \nhardware, and infrastructure \nservice subscriptions and \nexpressed as programmable \nAPIs that carry out work on \nthe customers behalf. These \nservices are  generally not  \nsimilar to on -premises \ntechnologies. Software \ndevelopers often leverage \nPaaS to eliminate manag ing \nthe underlying platform . The \ncustomers responsibilities are to configure the service properly, develop application  \ncode security , review the data used  within the service , and  configure security policies to Figure 1: Shared Responsibility Model  \n\n\n \nU/OO/ 126062 -24 | PP-24-0580  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0  \n 3 NSA | Uphold the Cloud Share d Responsibility  Model  \nrestrict network access between applications.  The CSP secures and maintains the \nhardware, operating system , networking, and platform  software  configurations .  \nSaaS  provides  end-user capabilities such as email, storage , and data modeling . In this \nservice  model  the customer generally configures the service, manages access control \npolicies, and secures their data. T he CSP secures and maintains the hardware , \noperating sy stem, networking, and application software . SaaS offerings in particular \nhave a wide range of security models  and consequently , customer responsibilities for \nthese services will vary.  \nOrganizations must understand  the details of  their responsibilities  for each offering that \nthey use. CSP documentation and terms of service outline how the customers and \nCSPs share the responsibilities . \nCustomer accountability  \nCustomers often assume  the CSPs responsibility to protect customer data is broader \nthan it actually is , leading to the customer failing to take needed actions . Many CSPs \ncommit to access customer resources  only under specific circumstances , and  often  only \nwith consent or notification  from the customer . Typically , this access is to support a \ncustomer  support request .  \nOrganizations must control access to the information in their cloud  resources . \nCustomers should identify the appropriate personnel who will be granted access and \nensure that data is  protected  by denying access to all others . They  should also ensure \napplication s deployed in the cloud are secure by design and by default . For m ore \ninformation,  see the NSA and CISA  CSI: Use Secure  Cloud  Identity and Access \nManagement Practices .  \nSecurity considerations  \nCloud vendors may share security assessments by indepen dent third -party evaluators , \nbut customers usually cannot perform any security testing of the underlying cloud \ninfrastructure . Organizations should consider third-party assessments and certifications \nwhen evaluating  specific cloud feature s.  \n\n \nU/OO/ 126062 -24 | PP-24-0580  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0  \n 4 NSA | Uphold the Cloud Share d Responsibility  Model  \nTo strengthen the security of the cloud environment, customers should perform \npenetration tests on their cloud tenants  in accordance with CSP terms of service . These \ntests will focus on the customers cloud  environment.  \nCustomers with multi -cloud environments should be  aware that different vendors \nimplement security features different ly. Organizations must ensure that their security \nposture is strong across and between platforms. Customers  should routinely check their \nsecurity controls as they import data into their dif ferent cloud zones . For more \ninformation,  see the NSA  CSI: Account for Complexities Introduced b y Hybrid and Multi -\nCloud E nvironment s.  \nCSPs are constantly making updates to their environments. Service updates and \nconfiguration changes could poten tially negatively alter service security. Processes are \nin place to prevent this from happening, but these processes are not necessarily \nfoolproof.  \nCyber  breaches and data spillages occur , and likely occur  more frequently than \nreported . Most CSPs publicly provide incident response guidance  for customers \nincluding : \n Outlin ing response planning and procedures  \n Recommending best practices  \n Providing playbooks for common scenarios  \n Giving security contact details  \n Advising on how to gather and use indicators of compromise  \n Instructing on finding lessons learned and how to apply them  \n Guiding how to track  incident metrics , such as mean time to detection, mean time \nto acknowledgement, meantime to containment and recovery  \nBest practices  \nTo ensure all shared responsibilities are met, current and future customers should \nconsider the following shared responsibilities :  \n Incident response : The customer should review the CSPs incident response \nprocedures , and put together  incident response playbooks  to prepare  for how to \nhandle a breach.  \n\n \nU/OO/ 126062 -24 | PP-24-0580  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0  \n 5 NSA | Uphold the Cloud Share d Responsibility  Model  \n Actively H unt for Intrusions in the Cloud : An organizations cyber defenders \nshould be trained on defending in the cloud and be equippe d with cloud security \ntools integrated with the customers resources.  CSPs are not responsible for \ndetecting when cloud resources are exploited due to a customer mistake.  For \nmore details, see the NSA  CSI: Manage Cloud Logs for Effective Threat Hunting . \n Implement a Dev SecOps process : Focus on placing security in the earliest \nsteps in the s oftware development lifecycle. For more information , see the NSA  \nCSI: Enforce Secure Automated Deployment Practices through Infrastructure as \nCode .  \n Alignment of cloud infrastructur e with mission : Customers should conduct \nroutine assessments and inventories to validate and understand their \norganizational cloud resources. Customers should also align their resources to \ncontrols  and to policies and procedures that best suit their goals and \nresponsibilities.  \n Data security : Customers are responsible for the data stored in their cloud \nenvironment. A vigorous security strategy should be in place to protect that data. \nFor more information , see the joint CSI: Secure Data in the Cloud .  \n Authentication: Organizations must have processes in place for secure access  \nusing  phishing -resistant multifactor authentication.  \n Configure identity access management (IAM) : Cloud IAM service s implement \naccess controls for cloud resources , following customer  defined policies . For \nmore information, see  the joint CSI: Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access \nManagement Practices .  \n Key management : Key management is a complex  area of the shared \nresponsibility model , with the customers area of responsibility varying greatly by \noption. For more information, see the joint CSI: Use Secure  Cloud  Key \nManagement Practices .  \n Service level agreement (SLA) : Reviewing and understanding the S LA enable s \nfull transparency and clear language outlining customer and CSP responsibilities . \nIf the SLA is unclear  regarding  the customers responsibilities for securely using \nthe service offering , contact the CSP for more information .  \n Adaptation : The CSP and customer should maintain cyber awareness as new \nthreats emerge and strategies for defense change over time.  \n\n \nU/OO/ 126062 -24 | PP-24-0580  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0  \n 6 NSA | Uphold the Cloud Share d Responsibility  Model  \nFurther guidance  \nAdditional cybersecurity guidance can be found at  NSA Cybersecurity Advisories & \nGuidance .
