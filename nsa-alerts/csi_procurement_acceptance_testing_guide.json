[1] This guidance is \nintend ed to augment those processes with suggested procurement  guidance  and risk \nmitigation processes to ensure that enterprise -grade servers, laptops, and desktops are \nprocured with a robust set of security artifacts,  configurations, and capabilities.  \nEnable  Secure  Boot  \nAll enterprise -grade  servers,  laptops,  and desktop  computer s contain  firmware  and \nfirmware -level applications  that run outside  the purview  of the operating  system.  Almost  \nall of them  implement  the Unified  Extensible  Firmware  Interface  (UEFI)  [2] as defined  by \nthe UEFI  Forum.  The UEFI  Secure  Boot process  implements  guidance  provided  by \nNIST  SP 800-147 \"BIOS  Protection  Guidelines\"  [3] or NIST  SP 800-147b  \"BIOS  \nProtection  Guidel ines for servers\".  [4] All UEFI -based  devices  shou ld be configured  with \nSecure  Boot enabled.  Enterprise  procurements  should  specify  that the manufacturer \ninclude and enable Secure  Boot as part of device  configuration  requirements.  \nEnterprise  security  monitoring  systems  should  check  that Secure Boot is enabled  on all \nUEFI -based  devices  after every  device  boot.  \nRequire  Trusted  Platform  Modules   \nThe Trusted Platform Module  (TPM ), as defined  by the Trusted  Computing  Group  \n(TCG),  is a small  security  coprocessor that  can be a standalone  component  or included  \nas part of another  component , such  as a microprocessor.  Most  enterprise -grade  laptops  \nand desktops  include  a TPM  version  2.0 since  it is required  by Microsoft  for Windows  \n8.1 or higher.  For servers,  the TPM  is typically  an add-on component  that needs  to be \nspecified  on the ordering  manifest  by administrators and procurement officials . \nProcurements  of servers  should  ensure  that optional TPM s are included  when  these \ndevice s are ordered.  For DoD, DODI  8500.01  \"Cybersecurity\"  [5] requires  DoD \ncomputer  assets  to be purchased  with a TPM.  \nDODI  8500.01  also calls for the National Security Agency (NSA)  to provide  use cases,  \nimplementation  standards,  and plans  for DoD to leverage  the functionality  of the TPM.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 205637 -23 | PP-23-2954  | SEP 2023 Ver. 1.0 4 \nNSA | Procurement and Acceptance Testing Guide  \nThis guidance  outlines  a use case  for the validation  of the supply  chain  using  an artifact  \ncalled  the Platform  Certificate  as outlined  in the following  sections.  \nRequire  Platform  Certificate s \nThe TCG  defines  the Platform  Certificate  as a digital  certificate  that binds  a device  to a \nspecific  manufacturer,  model,  and serial  number.  [6] It also contains  a list of internal  \ncomponents  that can be considered  a hardware  bill of materials  for the device.  The \nmanufacturer creates the certificate  during  the manufacturing  process  of a device.  The \nPlatform  Certificate  can be used  to detect  counterfeit  devices,  counterfeit  internal  \ncomponents,  swapped  components,  and unauthorized  configuration  changes  to the \ndevice.  This becomes  a critical  artifact  used  as part of an Acceptance  Test that should  \nbe performed  when  the device  arrives  at an organization 's receiving  department.  \nProcurements  of servers,  laptops,  and desktops  should  include  requirements  for the \nOEM  to create  the Platform  Certificate.  Its contents  should  meet  the recommendations  \nspecified  in the \"TCG  PC Client  Platform  Firmware  Integrity  Measurement\".  [7] \nPlatform  Certificates  have  a Delta  Platform  Certificate  that should  be created  when  a \nvalue-added  reseller  (VAR)  changes  the hardware  configuration  of a device.  For \nexample,  the Delta  Platform  Certificate  would  record  any component  upgrades  made  by \nthe VAR.  Each  VAR should  be required  to create  Delta  Platform  Certificates  by the \nprocurement contract . \nPlatform  Certificates  are currently  available  from most  server, laptop,  and desktop  \nOEMs . Some  OEM s provide  the Platform  Certificate  as part of their standard  offering , \nwhile others  may provide  it as optional  item in a similar  fashion  to the availability  of a \nTPM  on enterprise -grade  servers.  Procurements  should  ensure  that a Platform  \nCertificate  is required to be included  when  the device  is ordered.  \nEstablish  an enterprise  Acceptance  Testing  process  \nIdeally, every  procured  device  would be tested upon  delivery to an organization. NIST  \nSP 161 section  MA-3 item 1 states  \"the enterprise  should  deploy  Acceptance  Testing  to \nverify  that the maintenance  tools  of the ICT [(information and communication \ntechnology)] supply  chain  infrastructure  are as expected.\"  Procurement  contracts  for \nservers,  laptops,  and desktop  computer s should  include  a clause  indicating  that devices  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 205637 -23 | PP-23-2954  | SEP 2023 Ver. 1.0 5 \nNSA | Procurement and Acceptance Testing Guide  \nprocured  are required  to pass  an Acceptance  Test and that any devices , which  fail \nthose  tests , will be considered  defective  and returned.  \nWhen a device is received, t he enterprises  receiving  department  should  perform  an \nautomated  Acceptance T est that validate s the Platform  Certificate  by checking  its \nsignature  and matching  the components  it lists  against  the device  itself.  Many  OEMs  will \nprovide  a set of tools  to perform  this check.  Several  open -source  projects  (e.g.,  \nhttps://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS  [8]) can perform this check as well . \nNIST  1800 -34C \"Validating  the Integrity  of Computing  Devices\"  is a NIST Cybersecurity \nPractice  Guide that illustrates  how to create  an Acceptance  Test that utilizes  the TPM  \nand performs  the Platform  Certificate  checks.  [9] Many  OEMs  for servers,  laptops,  and \ndesktops  participated  in the National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE) \nproject  that led to the guide . \nThe enterprise  should  consider  establishing  one or more  pilot programs  to introduce  an \nAcceptance  Test before  rolling  it out to the entire  enterprise.  Testing  a subset  of \nrandomly  selected  devices  may be necessary  until the testing  can be completely  \nautomated.  The Enterprise  should  also consider  running  the Acceptance  Test on an \nisolated  network  to limit the risk of connecting  a potentially  compromised  device  to the \nEnterprise  network.  Once the roll out is  complete , the Acceptance  Test should test \nevery  procured  device  upon  delivery.  \nPost acceptance  configuration  \nNSA guidance  for \"UEFI  Lockdown Quick Guidance \" should  be followed  as a post \nacceptance  configuration  lockdown  practice  to set recommended UEFI co nfiguration \nsettings, including UEFI passwords, boot order, boot options, enabling Secure Boot, \nand enabling and activating the TPM.  [10] \nFuture  technology  considerations  \nIndustr y is developing the following  technologies  that appear to be  very promising  and \nmay be reflected  in a future  version  of this guidance:  \nReference  Integr ity Manifests  \nThe TCG  defined  a PC Client  Reference  Integrity  Manifest  (RIM)  that provides  a set of \nsigned  firmware  digests  (hashes)  that can be used  in conjunction  with TPM  and UEFI  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 205637 -23 | PP-23-2954  | SEP 2023 Ver. 1.0 6 \nNSA | Procurement and Acceptance Testing Guide  \nfirmware  to \"Attest\"  that the firmware  has booted  the device  into a known  (trusted)  state.  \n[11] Procurements  of servers,  laptops,  and desktops  should  include  requirements  to \ncreate  a TCG  PC Client  RIM by the OEM.  The contents  of the Platform  Certificate  \nprovided  by the OEM  should  meet  the recommendations  specified  in \"TCG  PC Client  \nPlatform  Firmware  Integrity  Measurement\".  [7] \nCyber  resiliency  \nThe TCG  is defining  a set of cyber-resilient  technologies  compliant  with SP 800-193. \n[12] Cyber  resiliency  provides  a set of protect ion, detect ion, and recovery  capabilities  \nabove  and beyond  UEFI  Secure  Boot.  Enterprises should procure s ervers,  laptops,  and \ndesktops  with cyber-resilient  capabilities , and en terprise  security  management  systems  \nshould  manage  the cyber-resiliency  mechanism s available  in those devices . \nInternal  component  selection  \nSeveral  security  protocols,  such  as the Security  Protocols  and Data  Models  (SPDM)  \nprotocol , [13] enable  authentication,  attestation , and key exchange  to assist  in enabl ing \nenterprise -wide infrastructure  security.  These  protocols  are likely  to enable  attestation  of \nthousands  of internal  components , such  as hard drives,  memory  sticks,  and network  \ncards  within  different  computers . Procurement  of servers,  laptops,  and desktops  should  \ninclude  language  that provides  a preference  for components  that incorporate  \nstandard ized security  protocols , such  as SPDM.  \nOnly accept secure devices  \nEnterprises should leverage procurement contracts to require the latest security \ncapabilities in their devices and then check that devices meet those requirements upon \ndelivery. Any less, and the organizations security  foundation could be unreliable since \nthe building blocks of its computing infrastructure the servers, laptops, and desktops  \nthemselves may not be properly secured.  \nWorks  cited \n[1] NIST,  SP 800-161 Rev. 1 \"Cybe rsecurity  Supply  Chain  Risk Management  Practices  for Systems  \nand Organizations , May 2022,  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800 -161/rev -1/final  \n[2] UEFI  Forum,  Inc, \"Unified  Extensible  Firmware  Interface  (UEFI)  Specification , Release  2.10,  \nAugust 2022 ,  https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_10_Aug29.pdf  \n[3] NIST , SP 800-147 \"BIOS  PROTECTION  GUIDELINES , April 2011,  \nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800 - 147/final  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 205637 -23 | PP-23-2954  | SEP 2023 Ver. 1.0 7 \nNSA | Procurement and Acceptance Testing Guide  \n[4] NIST , SP 800-147b  \"BIOS  PROTECTION  GUIDELINES  FOR  SERVERS , August  2014,  \nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800 -147b.pdf  \n[5] Department  of Defense , INSTRUCTION  8500.01  \"Cybersecurity , March  2014,  Incorporating  \nChange  1, Effective   October  7, 2019,  \nhttps:// www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/850001_2014.pdf  \n[6] Trusted  Computing  Group,  \"TCG  Platform  Certificate  Profile , Version  1.1 Revision  19, April 2020,  \nhttps://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp -\ncontent/uploads/IWG_Platform_Certificate_Profile_v1p1_r19_pub_fixed.pdf  \n[7] Trusted  Computing  Group,  \"TCG  PC Client  Platform Firmware  Integrity  Measurement\" \nhttps://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp -\ncontent/uploads/TCG_PC_Client_FIM_v1_r 40_02dec2020.pdf  \n[8] NSA,  \"Host  Integrity  at Runtime  and Startup  (HIRS),  https://github.com/nsacyber/HIRS  \n[9] NIST , 1800 -34c \"Validating  the Integrity  of Computing  Devices , June  2022,  \nhttps:// www.nccoe.nist.gov/publications/practice -guide/validating -integrity -computing -devices -nist-\n1800 -34-practice - guide  \n[10] NSA,  \"UEFI Lockdown Quick Guidance , March  2018,  \nhttps:// www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/what -we-do/cybersecurity/professional - resources/csi -\nuefi-lockdown.pdf  \n[11] Trust ed Computing  Group,  \"TCG  PC Client  Reference  Integrity  Manifest  Specification , Version  1.4 \nNovember   2020,  https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp -\ncontent/uploads/TCG_PC_Client_RIM_r1p04_pub.pdf  \n[12] NIST , SP 800-193 \"Platform  Firmware  Resiliency  Guidelines , May 2018,  \nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800 -193.pdf  \n[13] DMTF,  \"Security  Protocols  and Data  Models  (SPDM) , Version  1.2.1,  June  2022,  \nhttps:// www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0274_1.2.1.pdf  \nDisclaimer  of endorsement  \nThe information  and opinions  contained  in this document  are provide d \"as is\" and without  any warranties  or guarantees.
