By using the objective \ncriteria detailed below,  government employees and organizations can make more informed decisions about which \ncollaboration services meet their particular needs. By following the practical guidelines, users can draw down their risk \nexposure and become harder targets for  malicious threat actors . \nNote that individual departments and agencies may provide specific services or issue specific direction for their \nteleworkers. This document does not  override or supersede any official guidance provided by your organization. Consult \nyour dep artment or agency IT support or CIO organization for further guidance . \nCriteria to Consider When Selecting a Collaboration Service  \n1. Does the service implement end -to-end encryption  (E2EE) ? \n2. Are strong, well -known, testable encryption standards used?  \n3. Is multi -factor authentication (MFA) used to validate users identities?  \n4. Can users see and control who connects to collaboration sessions ? \n5. Does the service privacy policy allow the vendor to share data with third parties or affiliates?  \n6. Do users have the abili ty to securely delete data from the service and its repositories as needed?  \n7. Has the collaboration services source code been shared publicly (e.g. open source)?  \n8. Has the service and/or app been reviewed or certified for use by a security -focused nationally recognized or \ngovernment body?  \n9. Is the service developed and/or hosted under the jurisdiction of a government wit h laws that could jeopardize \nUSG official use?   \nUsing Collaboration Services Securely  \n If possible, use government furnished e quipment (GFE) that  is managed and intended for government use only , \nand utilize secure services designed for government use . \n If you download a  collaboration  service app, be sure you know where it came from .  \n Ensure that encryption is enabled when initiating a collaboration session.  \n Use the most secure means possible for meeting invitations . \n Verify that only intended invitees are participating before beginning , and throughout , each session.  \n Ensure that any information  shared is appropriate for the participants.  \n Ensure that your physical environment does not provide unintentional access to voice, video, or data during \ncollaboration sessions.  \n  \n  \n\n \n \n U/OO/134598 -20 | PP 20 -0713  | November  2020 Ver. 1.7 2 \nNSA | Selecting and Safely Using Collaboration Services for Telework  - UPDATE  \nTable  of Assessments against Criteria  \nService  1  End-to-End Encryption5 \n2  Testable \nEncryption  \n3  MFA  \n4  Invitation \nControls  \n5  Minimal 3rd \nParty Sharing  \n6  Secure Deletion  \n7  Public Source \nCode Shared  \n8  Certified \nService (FedRAMP \n/ NIAP)  Text Chat  \nVoice \nCalls  \nVideo \nCalls  \nFile \nSharing  \nScreen \nSharing  \nAdobe \nConnect i N N N N N Y Y Y Y Client  Y \nServer  Y N FedRAMP  \nAmazon \nChime ii N N N N N Y Y Y N Client  Y \nServer  Y N FedRAMP  \nCisco Webexiii Y1 Y1 Y1 Y1 Y1 Y Y1, 2 Y1 Y Client  Y \nServer  N3 N FedRAMP  \nDust Y N/A N/A N/A N/A N3 N Y N Client  Y \nServer  Y N None  \nGoogle  \nWorkspace iv N N N N N Y Y1 Y1, 4 Y Client  Y \nServer  Y2 N FedRAMP  \nGoToMeetingv Y1 Y1 Y1 N/A N/A Y N Y1 Y Client  Y \nServer  N3 N None  \nJitsi Meetvi Y1 Y1 Y1 Y1 Y1 Y N Y N Client   N3 \nServer   N3 Y None  \nMattermost vii N N N N/A N Y Y2 Y4 N Client  Y \nServer  N Y None  \nMicrosoft \nTeamsviii N N N N N Y Y Y Y Client  Y1 \nServer  Y1 N FedRAMP  \nSignalix Y Y N/A Y N/A Y Y Y Y Client  Y \nServer  Y Y None  \nSkype for \nBusiness x N N N N N Y Y Y Y Client  Y1 \nServer  Y1 N FedRAMP  \nSlackxi N N N N N Y Y Y Y1 Client  Y1 \nServer  Y1 N FedRAMP  \nSMS Text  N N/A N/A N N/A N N N N Client  Y \nServer  N N None  \nWhatsAppxii Y N/A Y Y N/A Y Y Y Y Client  Y \nServer  Y N None  \nWickrxiii Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Client  Y \nServer  Y Y None  \nWire Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Client  Y \nServer  Y Y None  \nZoomxiv Y1 N N Y1 N Y Y1 Y Y Client  Y \nServer  N3 N FedRAMP  \n                                            \nLegend: Y = Yes, N = No; N/A = Not Applicable  \n1 Configurable  \n2 Free Version - N \n3 No Published Details  \n4 Partial  \n5 End-to-end Encryption (E2EE) m ay be limited by app, browser, number of participants , or capabilities of other clients.
