Note : \nfor more information on Russian state -sponsored cyber activity, including known TTPs, see joint CSA \nUnderstanding and Mitigating Russian State -Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical In frastructure .  \nCyber threat actors from the following Russian government and military organizations have conducted \nmalicious cyber operations against IT and/or OT networks : \n The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) , including FSBs Center 16  and Center 18  \n Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)  \n Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), 85th Main Special Service \nCenter (GTsSS)  \n GRUs Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST)  \n Russian Ministry of Defense, Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics \n(TsNIIKhM)  \nThe Russian Federal Security Service  \nOverview: FSB, the KGBs successor agency, has conducted malicious cyber operations targeting \nthe Energy Sector, including UK and U.S. energy companies, U.S. aviation organizations, U. S. \ngovernment and military personnel, private organizations, cybersecurity companies, and journalists. \nFSB has been known to task criminal hackers for espionage -focused cyber activity ; these same \nhackers have separately been responsible for disruptive rans omware and phishing campaigns.  \nIndustry reporting identifies three intrusion sets associated with the FSB , but the U.S. and UK \ngovernments have only formally attributed one of these sets known as BERSERK BEAR to FSB.  \n BERSERK BEAR (also known as Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, and \nTemp.Isotope)  has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted entities in Western \nEurope and North America , including state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) organizations , as \nwell as  Energy, Transportation Systems, and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector \norganizations . This group has also targeted the Water and Wastewater Systems Sector and \nother critical infrastructure facilities.  Common TTPs include scanning to exploit internet -facing \ninfrastructure and network appliances, conducting brute  force attacks against public -facing \nweb applications, and leveraging compromised infrastructure often websites frequented or \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 4 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nowned by their target for Windows New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTL M) \ncredential theft. Industry reporting assesses that this actor has a destructive mandate.  \nThe U.S. and UK government s assess that this APT group is almost certainly FSBs Center \n16, or Military Unit 71330, and that FSB s Center 16 has conducted cyber ope rations against \ncritical IT systems and infrastructure in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.  \nResources : for more information on BERSERK BEAR , see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage \non Dragonfly . \nHigh -Profile Activity: in 2017, FSB employees, including one employee in the FSB Center for \nInformation Security ( also known as  Unit 64829 and Center 18), were indicted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) for accessing email accounts of U.S. government  and military personnel, \nprivate organizations, and cybersecurity companies, as well as email accounts of journalists critical of \nthe Russian government.[ 9] More recently, in 2021, FSB Center 16 officers were indicted by the U.S . \nDOJ for their involvement in a multi -stage campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and \ninternational Energy Sector networks, depl oyed ICS -focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated \nenterprise and ICS -related data. One of the victims was a U.S. nuclear power plant.[ 10]  \nResources : for more information on FSB, see:  \n U.S. DOJ Press Release Four Russi an Government Employees Charged in Two Historical \nHacking Campaigns Targeting Critical Infrastructure Worldwide   \n Joint CSA Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of Indicted State -Sponsored Russian Cyber \nActors Targeting the Energy Sector   \n UK Press Release UK Exposes Russian Spy Agency Behind Cyber Incidents  \nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service  \nOverview : SVR has operated  an APT group  since at least 2008 that has targeted multiple critical \ninfrastructure organizations. SVR cyber threat actors have used a range of initial exploitation \ntechniques that vary in sophistication coupled with stea lthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised \nnetworks. SVR cyber actors novel tooling and techniques include:  \n Custom, sophisticated multi -platform malware targeting Windows and Linux systems (e.g., \nGoldMax and TrailBlazer) ; and \n Lateral movement via the c redential hopping technique, which includes browser cookie theft \nto bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) on privileged cloud accounts. [11] \nHigh -Profile Activity : the U.S. Government , the Government of Canada,  and the UK Government  \nassess that SVR cyber threat actors were responsible for the SolarWinds Orion supply chain \ncompromise and the associated campaign that affected U.S. government agencies, critical \ninfrastructure entities, and private sector organizations.

GTsSS actors have collected victim credentials by sending \nspearphishing emails that appear  to be  legitimate security alerts from the victims email provider  and \ninclude hyperlinks leading to spoofed popular webmail services logon pages. GTsSS actors have \nalso registered domains to c onduct credential harvesting operations. These domains mimic popular \ninternational social media platforms and masquerade as tourism - and sports -related entities and \nmusic and video streaming services.  \nHigh -Profile Activity : the U.S. Government assesses that GTsSS cyber actors have deployed \nDrovorub malware against victim devices as part of their cyber espionage operations. [16] The U.S. \nGovernment and UK Government  assess that GTsSS actors used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct \nwidespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds of \ngovernment and private sector targets worldwid e.[17] \nAlso known a s: APT28 , FANCY BEAR , Group 74 , IRON TWILIGHT , PawnStorm, Sednit, \nSNAKEMACKEREL,  Sofacy, STRONTIUM , Swallowtail, TG -4127, Threat Grou p-4127,  and Tsar \nTeam [ 18] \nResources : for more information on GTsSS, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT28 .  \nGRUs  Main Center of Special Technologies  \nOverview : GTsST, or Unit 74455, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2009 and has \ntargeted a variety of critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Energy, Transportation \nSystems, and Finan cial Services Sectors. According to industry reporting, GTsST also has an \nextensive history of conducting cyber espionage as well as destructive and disruptive operations \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 6 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nagainst NATO member states, Western government and military  organizations , and critic al \ninfrastructure -related organizations, including in the Energy Sector.  \nThe primary distinguishing characteristic of the group is its operations use techniques aimed at  \ncaus ing disruptive or destructive effects at targeted organizations using DDoS attacks or wiper \nmalware . The groups destructive operations have also leveraged wiper malware that mimics \nransomware or hacktivis m and can result in collateral effects to organization s beyond the primary \nintended targets. Some of their  disruptive operations have shown disregard or ignorance of potential \nsecondary or tertiary effects.  \nHigh -Profile Activity : the malicious activity below has been previously attributed to GTsST by the \nU.S. Government and the UK Government .[19][20] \n GTsST actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies  in \nDecember 2015, leading to disruption of multiple companies  operations and widespread \ntemporary outages. The actor s deployed BlackEnergy malware to steal user credentials and \nused BlackEnergys destructive component , KillDisk , to make infected computers inoperable.  \n In 2016, GTsST actors conducted a cyber -intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian electrical \ntransmission company and deployed CrashOverride malware  (also known as Industroyer) \nspecifically designed to attack power grids.  \n In June 2017, GTsST actors deployed NotPetya disruptive malware against Ukrainian \nfinancial, energy, and government organizations . NotPetya masqueraded as ransomware , had \na large collateral impact , and caused damage to millions of devices globally.  \n In 2018, GTsST actors deployed data -deletion malware against the Winter Olympics an d \nParalympics  using VPNFilter . \nThe U.S. Government, Government of Canada, and UK Government  have also attributed the October \n2019  large -scale, disruptive cyber operations against a range of Georgian web hosting providers to \nGTsST. This activity resulted in websites including sites belonging to the Georgian government , \ncourts, non -government organizations (NGOs), media, and businesses being defaced and \ninterrupted the service of several national broad casters.

Actors associated with TsNIIKhM have developed des tructive ICS \nmalware.  \nHigh -Profile Activity: TsNIIKhM has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for \nconnections to the destructive Triton malware (also called HatMan and TRIS IS); TsNIIKhM has been \nsanctioned by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth , and Development Office (FCDO) for a 2017 incident \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 7 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nthat involved safety override controls (with Triton malware) in a foreign oil refinery. [25][26] In 2021, \nthe U.S. DOJ indicted a TsNIIKhM Applied Development Center (ADC) employee for conducting \ncomputer intrusions against U.S. Energy Sector organizations. The indicted employee also accessed \nthe systems of a foreign oil refinery and deployed Triton malware.[ 27] Triton is a custom -built malware  \ndesigned to manipulate safety instrumented systems within ICS controllers, disabling the safety \nalarms that prevent dangerous conditions.  \nAlso known as : Temp.Veles, XENOTIME [ 28] \nResources : for more information on TsNIIKh M, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on TEMP.

This activity includes targeting Ukrainian government, military, and law \nenforcement entities using high -volume spearphi shing campaigns to deliver its custom \nmalware. According to  industry reporting, PRIMITIVE BEAR conducted multiple cyber \noperations  targeting Ukrainian organizations in the lead up to Russias invasion.   \nResources : for more information on PRIMITIVE  BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on \nthe Gamaredon Group . \n VENOMOUS BEAR  has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted governments \naligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), defense contractors, and other \norganizations of intelligence value. Venomous Bear is known for its unique use of hijacked \nsatellite internet connections for command and control (C2) . It is also known for the hijacking \nof other non -Russian state -sponsored APT actor infrastructure.[ 29] VENOMOUS BEAR has \nalso historically leveraged compromised infrastructure and maintained an arsenal of custom -\ndeveloped sophisticated malware families, which is extremely complex and interoperable with \nvariants developed over t ime. VENOMOUS BEAR has developed tools for multiple platforms, \nincluding Windows, Mac, and Linux.[ 30]  \nResources : for more information on VENOMOUS  BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage \non Turla . \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 8 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nRussian -Aligned Cybercrime Groups  \nCybercrime groups are typically financially motivated cyber actors that seek to exploit human or \nsecurity vulnerabilities to enable direct theft of money ( e.g., by obtaining bank login information) or by \nextorting money from victims. These groups pose consistent threats to critical infrastructure \norganizations globally.  \nSince Russias invasion of Ukr aine in February 2022, some cybercrime groups have independently \npublicly pledged support for the Russian government or the Russian people and/or threatened to \nconduct cyber operations to retaliate against perceived attacks against Russia or materiel suppo rt for \nUkraine. These Russian -aligned  cybercrime groups likely pose a threat to critical infrastructure \norganizations primarily through:  \n Deploying ransomware through which cyber actors  remove victim access to data (usually via \nencryption ), potentially caus ing significant disruption to operations.  \n Conducting DDoS attacks against websites.  \no In a DDoS attack, the cyber actor generates enough  requests to flood and  overload the \ntarget page and stop it from responding.  \no DDoS attacks are often accompanied by extor tion.  \no According to industry reporting, some cybercrime groups have recently carried out \nDDoS attacks against Ukrainian defense organizations, and one group claimed credit \nfor DDoS attack against a U.S. airport the actors perceived as supporting Ukraine  (see \nthe Killnet  section).  \nBased on industry and open -source reporting, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK \ncyber authorities assess multiple  Russian -aligned cybercrime groups pose a threat to critical \ninfrastructure o rganizations. These groups include:  \n The CoomingProject  \n Killnet  \n MUMMY SPIDER  \n SALTY SPIDER  \n SCULLY SPIDER  \n SMOKEY SPIDER  \n WIZARD SPIDER  \n The Xaknet Team  \nNote : although some cybercrime groups may conduct cyber operations in support of the Russian \ngovernment, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities assess that cyber \ncriminals will most likely continue to operate primarily based on financ ial motivations, which may \ninclude targeting government and critical infrastructure organizations.  \nThe CoomingProject  \nOverview : the CoomingProject  is a criminal group that extorts money from victims by exposing or \nthreatening to expose leaked data. Their data leak site was launched in August 2021.[ 31] The \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 9 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nCoomingProject stated they would support the Russian Government in response to perceived \ncyberattacks against Russia.[ 32] \nKillnet  \nOverview:  according to o pen-source reporting, Killnet released a video pledging support to \nRussia.[ 33]  \nVictims : Killnet  claimed credit for carrying out a DDoS attack against a U.S. airport  in March 2022 in \nresponse to U.S. materiel support for Ukraine.[ 34] \nMUMMY SPIDER  \nOverview : MUMMY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that creates, distributes, and operates the Emotet \nbotnet. Emotet is advanced, modular malware that originated as a banking trojan  (malware designed \nto steal information from banking systems but that may also be used to drop additional malware and \nransomware ). Today  Emotet  primarily functions as a downloader and distribution service for other \ncybercrime groups . Emotet h as been used to deploy WIZARD SPIDER s TrickBot, which is often a \nprecursor to ransomware delivery. Emotet has worm -like features that enable rapid spreading in an \ninfected network.  \nVictims: according to open sources, Emotet has been used to target indust ries worldwide, including \nfinancial, e -commerce, healthcare, academia, government, and technology  organizations  networks.  \nAlso known a s: Gold Crestwood , TA542, TEMP.Mixmaster, UN C3443  \nResources : for more information on Emotet, see joint Alert Emotet Malware . For more information on \nTrickBot , see joint CSA TrickBot Malware .  \nSALTY SPIDER  \nOverview:  SALTY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops and operates the Sality botnet. Sality \nis a polymorphic file infector that was discovered in 2003; since then, it has been replaced by more \nadvanced peer -to-peer (P2P) malware loaders.[ 35] \nVictims : according to industry reporting, in February 2022,  SALTY SPIDER conducted DDoS attacks \nagainst Ukrainian web forums used to discuss events relating to Russias military offensive against \nthe city of Kharkiv . \nAlso known a s: Sality  \nSCULLY SPIDER  \nOverview: SCULLY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that operates using a  malware -as-a-service \nmodel; SCULLY SPIDER maintains command and control infrastructure and sells access to their \nmalware and infrastructure to affiliates, who distribute their own malware.[ 36][37] SCULLY  SPIDER \ndevelops and operates the DanaBot botnet, which originated primarily as a banking Trojan but \nexpanded beyond banking in 2021 and has since been used to facilitate access for other types of \nmalware, including TrickBot, DoppelDridex, and Zloader. Lik e Emotet, Danabot effectively functions \nas an initial access vector for other malware, which can result in ransomware deployment.  \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 10 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nAccording to industry reporting, recent DDoS activity by the DanaBot botnet suggests SCULLY \nSPIDER has operated in support of Russias military offensive in Ukraine.  \nVictims : SCULLY SPIDER affiliates have primarily targeted organizations in the United States, \nCanada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, and Ukraine.[ 38] According to \nindustry reporting, in March 2022, Danabot was used in DDoS attacks against multiple Ukrainian \ngovernment organizations.  \nAlso known a s: Gold Opera  \nSMOKEY SPIDER  \nOverview : SMOKEY SPIDER is a cybercrim e group that develops Smoke Loader (also known as \nSmoke Bot), a malicious bot that is used to upload other malware. Smoke Loader has been available \nsince at least 2011, and operates as a malware distribution service for a number  of different payloads, \nincluding but not limited to DanaBot, TrickBot, and Qakbot.  \nVictims : according to industry reporting, Smoke Loader was observed in March 2022 distributing \nDanaBot payloads that were subsequently used in DDoS attacks against Ukrainia n targets.  \nResources : for more information on Smoke Loader, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Smoke \nLoader . \nWIZARD SPIDER  \nOverview: WIZARD SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops Tri ckBot malware and Conti \nransomware. Historically, the group has paid a wage to the ransomware deployers (referred to as \naffiliates), some of whom may then receive a share of the proceeds from a successful ransomware \nattack. In addition to TrickBot, notable  initial access and persistence vectors for affiliated actors \ninclude Emotet, Cobalt Strike, spearphishing, and stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) \ncredentials.  \nAfter obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER  affiliated actors have relied on various publicl y available \nand otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle before deploying Conti \nransomware.  \nWIZARD SPIDER pledged support to the Russian government and threatened critical infrastructure \norganizations of countries per ceived to carry out cyberattacks or war against the Russian \ngovernment.[ 39] They later revised this pledge and threatened to retaliate against perceived attacks \nagainst  the Russian people.[ 40] \nVictims : Conti victim organizations span across multiple industries, including construction and \nengineering, legal and professional services, manufacturing , and retail. In addition, WIZARD SPIDER \naffiliates have deployed Conti ransomware against U.S. healthcare and first responder networks . \nAlso known a s: UNC2727, Gold Ulrick  \nResources : for more information on Conti, see joint CSA Conti Ransomware .

According to i ndustry reporting, the XakNet Team may be work ing with or \nassociated with Killnet actors, who claimed credit for the DDoS attacks against a U.S. airport (see the \nKillnet  section).  \nVictims : according to industry reporting, in late March 2022, the XakNet Team leaked email con tents \nof a Ukrainian government official. The leak was accompanied by a political statement criticizing the \nUkrainian government, suggesting the leak was politically motivated.  \nMITIGATIONS  \nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities urge critical infrastructure \norganizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by immediately  (1) updating software, \n(2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, and (4) \nproviding end-user awarene ss and training . \n Updat e software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT \nnetwork assets . Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities  and critical and high \nvulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial -of-service on internet -facing \nequipment.  \no Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a risk -\nbased assessment strategy to determine the OT n etwork assets and zones that should \nparticipate in the patch management program.   \no Consider signing up for CISAs cyber hygiene services , including vulnerability \nscanning, to help reduce exposu re to threats. CISAs vulnerability scanning service \nevaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP \naddresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.  \n Enforc e MFA  to the greatest extent possible  and requir e accou nts with password \nlogins, including service accounts, to have strong  passwords . Do not allow passwords to \nbe used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have \naccess.  As Russian state -sponsored APT actors have demonstrated the ability to exploit \ndefault MFA protocols and known vulnerabilities, organizations should review configuration \npolicies to protect against fail open and re -enrollment scenarios. For more informatio n, see \njoint CSA Russian State -Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default \nMultifactor Authentication Protocols and PrintNightmare Vulnerability . \n If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them \nclosely . RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware , and risky \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 12 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nservices , including RDP , can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on -path \nattacke r. \no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and \nusing virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed \noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate \ncrede ntial theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private \nnetwork (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before \nallowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce \naccount loc kouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts , log \nRDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.  \no Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable \nports and protocols that ar e not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP \nTransmission Control Protocol Port 3389).  \n Provide end -user awareness and training  to help prevent successful targeted social \nengineering and spearphishing campaigns.  Phishing is one of the top infection v ectors for \nransomware, and Russian state -sponsored APT actors have conducted successful \nspearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.  \no Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods.  \no Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they \nreceive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.  \nAs part of a longer -term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments \nbased on role and functionality . Network segm entation can help prevent the spread of ransomware \nand threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between and access to various \nsubnetworks.  \n Ensure OT assets are  not externally accessible . Ensure strong identity and access \nmanagement when O T assets needs to be externally accessible.  \n Appropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network \nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network \nis compromised. Define a demilitar ized zone that eliminates unregulated communication \nbetween the IT and OT networks.  \n Organize OT assets into logical zones by considering  criticality, consequence, and operational \nnecessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and dep loy security \ncontrols to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones. Prohibit ICS \nprotocols from traversing the IT network.  \nTo further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state -sponsored or criminal actors, \nU.S., Austra lian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities encourage critical infrastructure \norganizations to implement the recommendations listed below.  \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 13 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nPreparing for Cyber Incidents  \n Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.  \no Ensure the cyber incident response plan contains ransomware - and DDoS -specific \nannexes. For information on preparing for DDoS attacks, see NCSC -UK guidance on \npreparing for denial -of-service attacks . \no Keep hard copies of the incident response plan to ensure responders and network \ndefenders  can access the plan  if the network has been shut down by ransomware , etc. \n Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures should be \nconducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test bac kup \nprocedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable \nthe spread of malware.  \no Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a \nransomware incident.  \n Ensure all backup data is encry pted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers \nthe entire organizations data infrastructure  with a particular focus on key data assets.  \n Develop recovery document ation  that include s configuration settings for common devices and \ncritical e quipment. Such documentation  can enable more efficient recovery following an \nincident.  \n Identify the attack surface by mapping and accounting all external -facing assets (applications, \nservers, IP addresses) that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks  or other cyber  operations.  \n For OT assets/networks : \no Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to or \ncontrol of the IT and/or OT environment.  \no Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or manual \ncontrols to ensur e ICS networks can be isolated from IT networks  if the connections \ncreate risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test \ncontingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety -critical functions can be \nmaintained during a cyber  incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at \nnecessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.  \no Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or \nOT networks need to be taken offline.  \no Implement data back up procedures.  \no Develop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common devices \nand critical OT equipment .  \nIdentity and Access Management  \n Require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong  passwords \nand do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to \nwhich an adversary may have access. Consider using a password manager; see NCSC -UKs \nPassword Manager Buyers Guide  for guidance.  \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 14 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \n Implement authentication timeout and lockout features to prevent repeated failed login \nattempts and successful brute -force attempts.  \n Create a deny list of known compromised credentials and prevent users from using known -\ncompromised passwords.  \n Secure credentials by restricting where accounts and credentials can be used and by using \nlocal device credential protection feature s. Russian state -sponsored APT actors have \ndemonstrated their ability to maintain persistence using compromised credentials.  \no Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are \nsecurely stored.  \no Ensure storage of clear text passwords in Local Security Authority Subsystem Service \n(LSASS) memory  is disabled . Note : for Windows 8, this is enabled by default. For \nmore information see Microsoft Security Advisory Update to Improve Credentials \nProtection and Management . \no Consider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication.  \no Implement Cred ential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 ( refer to Microsoft: \nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard  for more information). For Windows \nServer 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).  \no Minimize the Active Directory (AD) attack surface to reduce malicious ticket -granting \nactivity. Malicious activity such as Kerberoasting  takes advantage of Kerberos Ticket \nGranting Service ( TGS) and can be used to obtain hashed credentials that malicious \ncyber actors attempt to crack.  \n Audit domain controllers  to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are \nmonitored for anomalous activity.   \no Secure accounts.  \no Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the \nminimum permission necessary to complete  their tasks.  \no Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of \nadministrative tasks.  \no Create non -privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the non -\nprivileged accounts for all non -privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).  \n Disable inactive accounts uniformly across the AD, MFA systems, etc.  \n Implement time -based access for privileged accounts. The FBI and CISA observed \ncybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holidays and \nweekends in 2021 . Threat actors may view holidays and weekends when offices are \nnormally closed as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network defenders and IT \nsupport personnel at victim organizations. The just -in-time access method provisions \nprivileged access  when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege \n(as well as the zero -trust model) by setting network -wide policy to automatically disable admin \naccounts at the AD level. As needed, individual users can submit requests through a n \nautomated process that enables access to a system for a set timeframe.  \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 15 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nProtective Controls and Architecture  \n Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a \nthreat actor, ransomware, or other malware. Use netwo rk monitoring tools and host -based \nlogs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools \nare particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and \nuncommon network connections for e ach host.  \n Implement a firewall and configure it to block Domain Name System (DNS) responses from \noutside the enterprise network or drop Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.  \nReview which admin services need to be accessible externally and allow  those explicitly, \nblocking all others by default . \no U.S. Defense Industrial Base organizations  may sign  up for the NSA Cybersecurity \nCollaboration Centers Protective Domain Name System (PDNS) services.  \n Enable web application firewalls to mitigate application -level DDoS attacks.  \n Implement a multi -content delivery network (CDN) solution. This will minimize the threat of \nDDoS attacks by distributing and balancing web traffic across a network.  \nVulnerability  and Configuration Management  \n Use an antivirus programs  that uses heuristics and reputational ratings to check a files \nprevalence and digital signature prior to execution.  Note : organizations should assess the \nrisks inherent in their software supply chain  (including its security/antivirus software supply \nchain) in light of the existing threat landscape .  \no Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets \nusing up -to-date signatures.  \no Use a risk -based asset inventory strategy t o determine how OT network assets are \nidentified and evaluated for the presence of malware.  \n Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and \nmitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfiguration s and security \nweaknesses.  \n Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols.  \no Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary \nports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control \nactivity.  \no Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within \ndevices.  \n Identify business -to-business VPNs and block high -risk protocols.  \n Ensure OT hardware is in read -only mode.  \n Enable strong spam filters.  \no Enable strong spam filters to preven t phishing emails from reaching end users.  \no Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.  \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 16 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \no Implement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious \nwebsites or opening malicious attachments.  \n Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that \nare necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat \nactors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.  \n Review the security posture of third -party vendors and those interconnected with your \norganization. Ensure all connections between third -party vendors and outside software or \nhardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.  \n Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to \nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.  \n Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from \nrunning.  \nResponding to Cyber Incidents  \nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge network defenders \nof critical infrastructure organizations to exercise due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious \nactivity. Organizations detecting potential APT or r ansomware activity in their IT or OT networks \nshould:  \n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.  \n2. For DDoS attacks :  \na. Identify the source address originating the attack via the SIEM or logging service. If the \nattack is originating from a single pool of IP addres ses, block IP traffic from suspected \nIPs via access control lists or by contacting your internet service provider (ISP).  \nb. Enable firewall rate limiting to restrict  the amount of IP traffic coming in from suspected \nIP addresses  \nc. Notify your ISP and enable re mote triggered blackhole ( RTBH ). \n3. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup \ndata with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.  \n4. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.  \n5. Consider so liciting support from a third -party IT organization to provide subject matter \nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that \ncould enable follow -on exploitation.  \n6. Report incidents to appropriate cyber and  law enfo rcement  authorities:  \n U.S organizations : share information about incidents and anomalous activity to \nCISA s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov  or (888) 282 -0870 and/or the FBI \nvia your local FBI field office  or the FBIs 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292 -3937 or \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 17 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \nCyWatch@fbi.gov . For ransomware incidents, organizations can also report to the U.S. \nSecret Service via a U.S. Secret Service Field Office .  \n Australian organizations : if you have questions about this advice or have indications \nthat your environment has been compromised, call the ACSC at 1300 CYBER1 (1300 \n292 371) . To report an incident see cyber.gov.au/acsc/report . \n Canadian organizations : report incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca . \n New Zealand organizations : if your organi zation requires assistance from the \nNational Cyber Security Centre, contact  them directly via telephone at  (04) 498 -7654 \nor via email at ncscincidents@ncsc.govt.nz . \n UK organizations : report a significant cybersecurity incident at ncsc.gov.uk/report -an-\nincident  (monitored 24 hours) or, for urgent assistance, cal l 03000 200 973.  \nFor additional guidance on responding to a ransomware incident, see the CISA -Multi -State \nInformation Sharing and Analysis C enter (MS -ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.   \nSee the joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United \nStates on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remed iating Malicious Activity  for guidance on \nhunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling.  \nAdditionally, CISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage U.S. critical infrastructure owners and operators to \nsee CISAs Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks . \nAlthough tailored to federal civilian b ranch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures \nfor planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail \neach step for both incident and vulnerability response.   \nNote : U.S., Australian, Canadian, N ew Zealand, and UK cyber authorities strongly discourage paying \na ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional \norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or \nfund illicit activities. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that a victims files will be recovered.  \nRESOURCES  \n For more general information on Russian state -sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISAs \nRussia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  webpage and joint CSA Understanding and \nMitigating Russian State -Sponsored Cyber Threats to  U.S. Critical Infrastructure .  \n For alerts on malicious and criminal cyber activity, see the FBI Internet Crime Complaint \nCenter  webpage . \n For more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransom ware, \nrefer to StopRansomware.gov , a centralized, U.S. government webpage providing \nransomware resources and alerts.  \n For more information on mitigating DDoS attacks, see NCSC -UK Denial of Service (DoS) \nGuidance . \n\n  \n \n  TLP:WHITE  \n \nPage 18 of 20  |  Product ID: AA22 -110A  \nTLP: WHITE    Product ID : AA22-110A \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \n \n For more information on managing cybersecurity incidents, see NZ NCSC Inciden t \nManagement: Be Resilient, Be Prepared . \n For information on destructive malware, see joint CSA Destructive Malware Targeting \nOrganizations in Ukraine . \n Critical infrastructure owners and o perators with OT/ICS networks  should review the following \nresources for additional information:  \no Joint CSA NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across \nOperational Technologies and Control Systems  \no CISA factsheet Rising Ransomware Threat to Operational Technology Assets  \nDISCLAIMER  \nThe information you have accessed or received is being provided as is for informational purposes \nonly.
