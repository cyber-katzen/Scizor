This advisory provides details on the top 15 Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)  routinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2021, as well as \nother CVEs frequently exploited.  \nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities assess, in 2021, \nmalicious cyber actors aggressively targeted newly disclosed critic al software vulnerabilities against \nbroad target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. To a lesser extent, \nmalicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software vulnerabilities across a \nbroad spectrum of ta rgets.  \nThe cybersecurity authorities encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the \nMitigations  section of this CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems and \nimplementing a centralized patch management system to reduce the risk of compromise by malicious \ncyber a ctors.   \n\n \n \n  \n TLP:WHITE  \n Product ID: AA22 -117A  \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nPage 2 of 20 |  Product ID: AA22 -117A  \nTLP: WHITE    TECHNICAL DETAILS  \nKey Findings  \nGlobally, in 2021, malicious cyber actors targeted internet -facing systems, such as email servers and \nvirtual private network (VPN) servers, with exploits of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. For most of the \ntop exploi ted vulnerabilities, researchers or other actors released proof of concept (POC) code within \ntwo weeks of the vulnerabilitys disclosure, likely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of \nmalicious actors.  \nTo a lesser extent, malicious cyber actors co ntinued to exploit publicly known, dated software \nvulnerabilities some of which were also routinely exploited in 2020  or earlier. The exploitation of \nolder vulnerabilities demonstrates the c ontinued risk to organizations that fail to patch software in a \ntimely manner or are using software that is no longer supported by a vendor.  \nTop 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities  \nTable 1 shows the top 15 vulnerabilities U.S., Australian, Canadian, New  Zealand, and UK \ncybersecurity authorities observed malicious actors routinely exploiting in 2021, which include:  \n CVE-2021 -44228 . This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apaches Log4j library, an \nopen -source logging framework. An actor can exploit  this vulnerability by submitting a \nspecially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary \ncode. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control over the system. The actor can then \nsteal information, launch rans omware, or conduct other malicious activity.[ 1] Log4j is \nincorporated into thousands of products worldwide. This vulnerability was disclosed in \nDecember 2021; the rapid widespr ead exploitation of this vulnerability demonstrates the ability \nof malicious actors to quickly weaponize known vulnerabilities and target organizations before \nthey patch.  \n CVE-2021 -26855, CVE -2021 -26858, CVE -2021 -26857, CVE -2021 -27065 . These \nvulnerabilities , known as ProxyLogon, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful \nexploitation of these vulnerabilities in combination (i.e., vulnerability chaining) allows an \nunauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Exchange Servers,  which, \nin turn, enables the actor to gain persistent access to files and mailboxes on the servers, as \nwell as to credentials stored on the servers. Successful exploitation may additionally enable \nthe cyber actor to compromise trust and identity in a vulne rable network.  \n CVE-2021 -3452 3, CVE -2021 -34473, CVE -2021 -31207 . These vulnerabilities, known as \nProxyShell, also affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful exploitation of these \nvulnerabilities in combination enables a remote actor to execute arbit rary code . These \nvulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which typically runs on \nport 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g., Microsofts web server). CAS is \ncommonly exposed to the internet to enable us ers to access their email via mobile devices \nand web browsers.  \n CVE-2021 -26084 . This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, \ncould enable an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.

Attempted mass exploitation of this vulnerability \nwas observed in September 2021.  \nThree of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities were also routinely exploited in 2020 : CVE -\n2020 -1472, CVE -2018 -13379, and CVE -2019 -11510. Their continued exploitation indicates that many \norganizations fail to patch software in a timely manner and remain vulnerable to malicious cyber \nactors.  \nTable 1: Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2021  \nCVE Vulnerability \nName  Vendor and \nProduct  Type  \nCVE-2021 -44228  Log4Shell  Apache Log4j  Remote code execution \n(RCE)  \nCVE-2021 -40539   Zoho \nManageEngine AD \nSelfService Plus  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -34523  ProxyShell  Microsoft \nExchange Server  Elevation of privilege  \nCVE-2021 -34473  ProxyShell  Microsoft \nExchange Server  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -31207  ProxyShell  Microsoft \nExchange Server  Security feature bypass  \nCVE-2021 -27065  ProxyLogon  Microsoft \nExchange S erver  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -26858  ProxyLogon  Microsoft \nExchange Server  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -26857  ProxyLogon  Microsoft \nExchange Server  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -26855  ProxyLogon  Microsoft \nExchange Server  RCE  \nCVE-2021 -26084  \n  Atlassian \nConfluence Server \nand Data Center  Arbitrary code execution  \nCVE-2021 -21972   VMware vSphere \nClient  RCE  \n\n \n \n  \n TLP:WHITE  \n Product ID: AA22 -117A  \n UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nPage 4 of 20 |  Product ID: AA22 -117A  \nTLP: WHITE    CVE Vulnerability \nName  Vendor and \nProduct  Type  \nCVE-2020 -1472  ZeroLogon  Microsoft Netlogon \nRemote Protocol \n(MS-NRPC)  Elevation of privilege  \nCVE-2020 -0688   Microsoft \nExchange Server  RCE  \nCVE-2019 -11510    Pulse Secure \nPulse Connect \nSecure  Arbitrary file reading  \nCVE-2018 -13379   Fortinet FortiOS \nand FortiProxy  Path traversal  \nAdditional Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities  \nIn addition to the 15 vulnerabilities listed in table 1, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK \ncybersecurity authorities identified vulnerabilities, listed in table 2, that were also routinely exploited \nby malicious cyber actors in 2021.  \nThese vulnerabilities include multiple vulnerabilities affecting internet -facing systems, including \nAccellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA), Windows Print Spooler, and Pulse Secure Pulse Connect \nSecure.

Reputable MSPs can patch \napplications such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other employee \ncollaboration too lsfor their customers. However, as MSPs and CSPs expand their client \norganization's attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, organizations should \nproactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly reduce that risk.
