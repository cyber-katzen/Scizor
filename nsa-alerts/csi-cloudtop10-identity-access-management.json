These on -demand \nservices allow for remote storage, compute resources, and  sharing of data between \nauthorized users that enable s a wider range of collaboration and mission  flexibility . \nHowever, c loud environments pose unique security challenges. Proper identity \nprotection practices and access control policies are necessary to help provide  integrity \nand confidentiality of data in the cloud . Malicious cyber actors (MCAs) frequently target \ncloud envi ronments due , in part,  to their remote nature  and shared security models .  \nThe purpose of this cybersecurity information sheet (CSI) is to  explain some of the \ncommon threats to cloud identity management , and  to recommend best practices \norganizations should employ to mitigate these threats  when operating in the cloud . \nThreat model \nIncrease s in both telework and off -premise s storage and services have rapidly \nexpanded cloud reliance. Cloud environments are valuable  targets for adversaries . As \norganizations continue to move data and services into these  environments , MCAs can \ntake advantage of the ubiquitous access clouds  often provide . Identity and access \nmanagement (IAM) is critical to securing cloud resources from MCAs. However, u sers \ncan easily misconfigure access controls  to accident ally allow open access to resources.  \nSuch misconfigurations are common and have resulted in massive data leaks .  \nFor example, according to Website Planet, whose security researchers discovered and \nreported a data leak in October 2021  where  a marketing research and conferencing \ncompany left an Amazon S3 bucket accessible to the public. The storage bucket \nreportedly co ntained over 8TB of customer data including business meeting recordings, \naudio transcripts, and more . [1] More recently , in May 2023 a corporation reported an \nincident in which a misconfiguration in their cloud environment made customer data \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \n(including names, phone numbers, emails, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and \nmore) publicly accessible potentially from October 2016 until May 2023 . [2] \nInitial malicious access attempts on cloud resources frequently target user credentials. \nFor example, social engineering often  target s users  in an  attempt to harvest credentials \nor get users to accept multifactor authentication ( MFA ) push requests. MCAs may also \nattempt to exploit external  accounts that have been granted access to the organizations \ntenant.  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nInitial Access  Phishing [ T1566 ] \nInitial Access  Trusted Relationship [ T1199 ] \nCredential Access  Multi -Factor Authentication Request Generation [ T1621 ] \n \nOnce an MCA compromise s the targeted cloud environment, they  may try to grant \nthemselves roles  or keys, or provision new accounts  to escalate privilege, persist, or \nmove laterally , targeting cloud services they have interest in or attempting to leverage \nfederated identities to access the victims on -prem environment .  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nPersistence  Account Manipulation [ T1098 ] \nPersistence, Defense Evasion  Modify Authentication Process [ T1556 ] \nPersistence  Create Account : Cloud Account  [T1136 .003] \nLateral Movement  Remote Services: Cloud Services [ T1021.007 ] \nSecurity considerations  \nWhile many of the standard recommendations for securing identities on -prem still apply, \nthere are additional considerations to factor in when managing identities for a cloud \nenvironment.  \nIdentity management  \nMulti factor authentication  \nSingle -factor authentication ( e.g., password or PIN only) based account access is \nsusceptible to credential theft, forgery, and reuse across multiple systems. Cloud \naccounts are generally globally accessible ; thus they are more susceptible to certain \ntypes of single -factor authentication  weaknesses . Multi factor authentication  (MFA)  \nboosts account security, better  resist ing compromise  by enhancing user verification \n\n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nmethods . MFA requires t wo or more factors for login : something the user knows, has, or \nis. Typical ly this is implemented using a password and a second factor usually  based on \na randomly seeded numeric token, a biometric option (such as a fingerprint  or facial \nrecognition), or a physical  token (unique hardware -based identifier: smartcard, Common \nAccess Card , etc.).   \nMany types of MFA are susceptible to phishing techniques1. Wher e possible , \norganizations should use phishing -resistant MFA methods such as public key (PK) -\nbased Fast Identity Online ( FIDO )/WebAuthn Authentication or public key infrastructure \n(PKI)-based MFA  (e.g., CAC/PIV cards) . Phishing -resistant MFA  commonly leverages a  \nhardware bound private key. If the device/token allows the private key to be exported \nthat impacts the trustworthiness of the authentication factor, as the user may export t he \nprivate key which may then be shared or otherwise compromised if improperly handled. \nOrganizations using third -party MFA tooling options should maintain awareness of \nsecurity relevant changes to the chosen MFA tooling, especially changes that may allow \nkeys to be exportable. For further guidance on phishing -resistant MFA implementations , \nsee CISAs  fact sheet , Implementing Phishin g-Resistant MFA . [4]  \nManaging PKI certificates  \nCertificates can be used in cloud environments in many ways. Two common types of \nPKI certificates used in cloud environments are client certificates and server -side \ntransport layer security (TLS) certificates. Client certificates can be used for \nauthenticating users to a cloud service (either solely or as part of an MFA solution) or to \nauthenticate non -person entities (aka workload identities or service identities) to \nother systems. As organizations increasingly deploy workloads in the cloud, TLS \ncertificates for these applications must be properly managed. Proper management \nincludes secure key stor age and periodic key rotation, as well as implementation of key \nrevocation.  \nOrganizations using PKI certificates for user authentication should m aintain a list of \ntrusted certificate authorities, only allow trusted certificates, d ocument revoked \ncertificat es, and remove users and block access associated with revoked certificates. \nFor guidance on managing personal identity verification (PIV) cards for federal \ngovernment use refer to FIPS 201 -3. [5]  \n                                            \n1 For more details on phishing techniques  refer to Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at  Phase One . [3] \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nWhen hosting workloads  in the cloud , it is important to securely manage the TLS server \ncertificates used for securing web communications  and any client certificates used for \ninter-workload authentication . Some cloud servic es will manage the certificates for the \ncustomer  automatically , but some  deployments use customer -managed certificates . \nOrganizations using customer -managed application servers should refrain from storing \nprivate keys in plain text on the virtual instance hosting the server. Certificates should \ninstead be managed with a key management system  (KMS) , which functions to  store \nthe encrypted keys, and control and monitor access to the key s. Key management \nsystems can decrypt stored keys into memory for use in gr anting access as needed . \nKeys should also be regularly rotated through automated mechanisms. Misusing \ncertificates weakens security and diminish es the integrity  of the system. For more \ninformation on threats to TLS server certificates refer to National Ins titute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) SP 1800 -16. [6] For additional guidance on TLS \nimplementations refer to NIST SP 800 -52. [7] For more information on cloud key \nmanagement, see the NSA and CISA  CSI: Use Secure C loud Key Management \nPractices . \nCredential best practices  \nMisconfiguration and improper handling can expose user credentials to adversarial \nexploit. Cloud credentials should  never be stored in plain text. If needed, users can \nleverage secrets management too ls (preferably ones that use hardware security module \n(HSM) capabilities to protect secret keys) to manage cloud credentials (e.g., password \nmanagers for human secrets or secret stores for workload credentials). To further \nmitigate risk, users should d isable features that allow web sites or programs to \nremember passwords. MFA, such as one -time PIN tokens, PKI tokens, or smartcards, \nfor users and non -person PKI -based authentication (for workloads) should be \nimplemented where possible.  \nIn situations where PK I-based authentication is not technically feasible , secret keys can \nbe generated to allow applications to manage cloud resources programmatically. When \nissuing keys for applications that need to interact with the cloud, it is vital that these be \nhandled pr operly as MCAs see them as  valuable targets. Each  cloud service provider  \n(CSP) offers different options for obtaining and managing these credentials so it is best \nto periodically review their g uidance. Overall, it is best to avoid creat ing keys with root o r \nadministrative privileges. These keys should be generated for short -term use only, and \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \naccounts should be granted the least required privileges needed  to accomplish \noperational  tasks. These credentials should never be included in plain  text in applicatio n \nsource code or embedded into binaries. Instead, t hey should be handled securely by a \nsecrets manager and stored encrypted. If using secure shell ( SSH) key pairs to connect \nto cloud hosted virtual machines , the private key should be stored in a secrets manager \nand should not be shared.  \nOrganizations should consider requiring administrators to connect to cloud resources \nusing privileged access workstations (PAWs) , which should be hardened according to \nestab lished best practices, require MFA, and perform thorough logging. Administrators \noften require access to cloud resources through protocols such as SSH that do not \nalways support these controls. PAWs are easier for organizations to control , properly \nharden , and monitor. PAWs can enforce MFA for all administrator actions, even when \nthe protocol does not support it , and simplify auditing of admin istrator  actions. This \nmakes hardening and logging on the workstations simpler than on unmanaged devices. \nSome CSPs offer PAWs as a service to ease adoption of this security feature.  \nIdentity federation  \nOrganizations operating in cloud environments customarily federate identities to simplify \nmanaging identities across environments. Systems that federate identities from  on-prem \nto cloud environments are frequently targeted by MCAs to allow movement between \nenvironments.  \nATT&CK Tactic   Technique  \nInitial Access  Valid Accounts : Cloud Accounts  [T1078.004 ] \n \nThe protection and monitoring of identity federation servers is crucial to overall security. \nEndpoint detection and response systems should be used on identity federation servers \nto identify exploitation attempts and changes should be routinel y audited to identify \npotential compromise. Protect certificates and keys used for identity federation with a \nhardware security module (HSM). Organizations should also implement network \nsegmentation principles to isolate these sensitive servers as much as possible. For \nmore information on identity federation system architectures and security see CISAs \nreport on Secure Cloud Business Applications Hybrid Identity Solutions Architecture . [9] \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nAccess management  \nManaging conditional context -based access  \nWhile secure p asswords, login tokens, and MFA  are useful for \nprotecting user accounts, MCAs  may still be able to compromise  a users \ncredentials. One way to limit the impact of such compromises  is by implementing \npolicies to enforce  conditional access  based on additional context . This context is \nexpressed in policies , which can often be set for cloud tenants to restrict a users ability \nto log in to a system if a predefined set of conditions are not met. For example, denying \nattempted  logins made  from outside permitted  geographical locations  based on their \ninternet protocol (IP) addresses .  \nThese controls can be especially usefu l for protecting privileged accounts or accounts \nwith broad/sensitive access by requiring administrators to log into these accounts from \nthe organizations on -prem facility. Organizations should thoroughly review and test \ntheir conditional access configura tions and enforcement to prevent advanced cyber \nadversaries from  exploiting gaps  in these policies . \nEncrypted channels for accessing resources  \nControlling access is important when storing cloud data. Unauthorized access can \ndegrade the overall security posture and negatively impact operations.  \n Assign permissions appropriate for the needs of the authorized user to access \nthe level of data require d for a task.  \n Continuously verify access and administrative privilege  assignments to validate \nthey align with the princip le of least privilege.  \n Enable m onitoring and logging  of access requests and policy changes .  \n Investigate a bnormal activity and reques ts.  \n Encrypt data at rest and in transit, securely storing and managing  crypto graphic  \nkeys2. \n Use secure protocols such as TLS1.2  or higher, using algorithms from the \nCommercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite 2.0 when possible and \nCNSA Suite 1.0 at a minimum  for client connections to cloud resources3. \n                                            \n2 For more details , see NSA & CISA  CSI: Use Secure Cloud Key Management Practices . \n3 For more details , see NSA & CISA  CSI: Implement Network Segmentation and Encryption in Cloud Environments . \n\n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nSeparation of duties  \nSeparation of duties is a critical concept when it comes to securing cloud resources. \nNIST defines s eparation of duties  as the principle that no user should be given enough \nprivileges to misuse the system on their own . [8] One way this can be accomplished is \nby requiring two -person controls for performing particularly sensitive operations .  \nAnother method  is by separating administrator roles to control how resources are \naccessed and managed . For example, access control administrators of the KMS with  \nthe necessary privileges to grant access to keys  protecting sensitive data or capabilities  \nshould not be able to grant themselves access to use th ose issued  keys. While there \nare cases where users should have the ability to create, manage, and use their own \nencryption keys , this is an important method of increasing the security of sensitive \norganizational data.  \nAdditionally, write access to backups should be restricted to help counter act \nransomware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by MCAs to target data \nbackups. One way to reduce the risk  of cloud environment  data backup breaches  is by \nprovisioning separate backup management accounts  for administrators who require \naccess to the backups . These precautions limit the impact that an insider threat actor or \nMCA who has access credentials  can do in a compromised cloud environment.  \nUser data protections  \nUser devices are a common attack vector for MCAs to gain access to an organizations \ncloud environment. It is important for c loud users to practice good cyber  hygiene whe re \nthe devices they use to access cloud resources  are concerned . Users  should:  \n Keep OS and application s updated and patched.  \n Refrain from opening emails and web links from unknown parties to minimize \nphishing and malware infection opportunities.   \n Change and remove defaults ( e.g., default passwords and default user \naccount s).  \n Monitor accounts for unexplained activities.  \n Verify URLs to check for modified URLs designed to redirect users to spoofed \nwebsites .  \n Consider the risk s and benefits  of allowing users to access cloud resources from \nunmanaged devices, such as bring your  own device or personal computers.  \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nPrivilege controls  \nImproperly constrained  user and application accesses can lead to excessive disclosure \nof sensitive data  and promote malicious movement through the cloud . Follow the \nprinciple of least privilege and res trict accounts to only the resources needed to perform \nmission functions . When granting privileges , keep in mind  that many cloud vendors use \nhierarch ical permission schemes, so granting a user or group privileged access to a \nresource will grant them the same level of access to nested resources that is, granting \naccess to a fold er or organizational unit  grants access to all resources within that \nunit. \nDifferent cloud vendors and services may offer different access control methods. The \nmost common metho ds are : \n Role-based access controls (RBAC) , and  \n Attribute -based access controls (ABAC) . \nMost CSPs offer a hybrid of the two approaches, augmenting roles with attribute -based \nconditions to enforce conditional access. When using RBAC, organizations can assign \nprivileges to roles and then assign users to a role, or role s, granting them the relevant \nprivileges. When the privilege assignments to a role are altered, the update affects \neveryone assigned that role. ABAC is a key element for Zero Trust (ZT) maturity in the \nidentity/user pillar . This method  is used  to control access to data by assigning attributes \nto resources and to users , providing more fine -grained policy protection to resources \nthan using RBAC policies alone. For more information on IAM ZT maturity, see \nAdvancing  Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the User Pillar .  \nOne way to manage enterprise permission controls and detect drift  is by codifying \npermissions . Known as policy  as code,  this approach is  beneficial for enterprise \npermission management as it can be used to create a known good state for permission \nsettings, can be audited and version controlled, and can be used to detect drift.  For \nmore details on using policy  as code in cloud environments , see the NSA CSI:  Enforce  \nSecure  Automated Deployment Practices through Infrastructure as Code . In addition to \npolicy  as code, identity governance systems may be used to automate workflows to \nassign roles to individuals based on business need s.  \nConsider implement ing the Just-in-Time (JIT)  security practice where increased \nprivilege d access to applications or a system is limited to pred etermined periods  for \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nspecified activities . Privilege elevation with JIT sh ould be logged and can require \njustification statements , if desired , for better tracking and verification of privilege \nrequests.   \nFinally, a void using privileged  account s for everyday activities , instead  only use the \nprivileged account for maintenance, update s, account management operations, threat -\nhunting operations, etc. , that require privileged access . Periodically audit IAM \nconfigurations to confirm  only necessary privileges are granted to users. Many  CSPs \noffer services that will track unused  privileges to help admins tailor accounts to the least \nprivileges users need to accomplish their day-to-day responsibilities . However, it is \nimportant to consider occasional or emergency (break glass) access when removing \nseemingly unused permissions.  \nSecuring  the cloud instance metadata service  \nThe cloud instance metadata service (IMDS) can be queried from virtual instances in \nthe cloud for general information about the tenant. However, this service can also be \nused to retrieve a variety of information , including IAM credentials that malicious actors \ncan use to gain additional access to the cloud tenant.  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nCredential Access  Unsecured Credentials : Cloud Instance Metadata API  \n[T1552.005 ] \n \nThe exact implementation of the cloud IMDS will vary by CSP . Typically , MCAs query \nthe IMDS by exploiting a server -side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in an \napplic ation that customer organizations are serving publicly from an instance running in \nthe cloud that has access to the IMDS . [10] \nUse established best practices for protecting applications, such as sanitizing user input \nand deploying web application firewalls . These practices may  prevent SSRF techniques  \nthat could use the application to query the IMDS and return credentials  to the malicious \nactor . Use the most up -to-date version of IMDS available, as it may implement \nadditional security measures. Restrict access to the IMDS for instances  or accounts  that \ndo not require i t. Each CSP s IMDS may work slightly differently ; therefore, it is \nimportant to review the vendors  best practice guidance regarding their IMDS to tak e all \npossible precautions to prevent  misuse of  the service . \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nBest practices  \nIt is important for organizations operating in the cloud to ensure employees understand \nthe risks that arise from improper identity and access management. To reduce the risk \nof a cybersecurity incident, organizations should follow these best practices:  \nIdentity management:   \n Require the use of phishing -resistant MFA  for user accounts . \n Do not store server TLS certificates in plain text on the virtual instance hosting a \nweb server; instead, use a secrets manager.  \n Handle user PKI certificates carefully to prevent unauthorized coll ection, and \npromptly revoke compromised or unnecessary certificates.  \n Only use secret keys when required and provision them for short -term access \nwith the least privileges necessary.  \n Secure identity federation servers and audit identity federation to detect  attempts \nby MCAs to abuse trust relationships.  \n \nAccess management:   \n Use context -based access control policies  and review policies prior to \ndeployment and periodically after deployment to identify potential gaps . \n Consider requiring administrators access cl oud resources using PAWs.  \n Limit use of administrative accounts and use JIT to limit privileged access and \nimprove tracking of privileged actions in the tenant.  \n Connect to cloud resources over an e ncrypted channel  using secure protocols \nsuch as TLS 1.2  or higher  and CNSA approved cipher suites (preferably CNSA \nSuite 2.0). \n Assign privileges according to best practices for a ccess control  by carefully \napplying the  separation of duties and  least privilege  principles , and audit privilege  \nassignments and acce ss request s.  \n Consider u sing policy as code to allow for improved tracking and review of \naccess control policies, and frequently check for drift.  \n Secure the cloud IMDS by restricting users/services with the privilege to query \nthe IMDS, using the most up t o date version, implementing vendor specific best \npractices, and implementing best practices to secure cloud -hosted applications \nand prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.  \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126063 -24 | PP-24-0832  | March  2024 Ver. 1.0 NSA & CISA | Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nFurther  guidance  \nSupplementary NSA cybersecurity guidance is available at NSA Cybersecurity \nAdvisories & Guidance .
