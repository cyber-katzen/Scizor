This is your past, \npresent and future.\nWhile Europe hasnt seen this level of \nkinetic activity since World War II, this \nhybrid war started in cyberspace. Its an \nenvironment where actors can increase their \npower, degrade others, and gain a strategic \nadvantage  often at a very low cost.  \nIn the weeks leading up to and following \nRussias invasion in Ukraine, at least seven new \nfamilies of destructive data wipers were used. \nOne even attacked satellite broadband service \nto disrupt Ukraines military communications \non the day of the invasion but spilled beyond \nthe conflict, impacting critical infrastructure \nremote monitoring of wind turbines in \nGermany, emergency services in France, and \ninternet access of select users in Europe. \nIndustry observed and reported on many of \nthese destructive wipers, demonstrating their \nunique insights into the conflict. \nThe Russian threats did not stop with Ukraine. \nHacktivists targeted our Defense Industrial \nBase and the communications and weapons \nsystems of EUCOM and NATO were in the crosshairs of our adversaries. The keys, codes, \nand cryptography we provide are vital: \nEncryption is the last line of defense.\nOur focus extends beyond the Russia-Ukraine \nconflict, but this example demonstrates the \ncomplex environment.  Our approaches must \nscale for China, Iran, North Korea, cybercrime, \nand other threats. \nIn addition to the insights we receive from \nindustry, we are committed to contributing \nour unique value to the conversation: foreign \nintelligence, practical experience with \nexploitation tradecraft, and deep technical \nexpertise of our adversaries. \nOften, what we know is not as sensitive as \nhow we know it. Our insights are useless \nunless someone can take action with them. \nWe empower our industry partners to act on \nthat information, and benefit from both their \naction and their insights.\nOur Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC) \nhas formed hundreds of industry partnerships \nwith the goal of better protecting our Defense \nIndustrial Base and sensitive government \nsystems. The intelligence picture we build, We are driving security  \noutcomes by sanitizing  \nand sharing our secrets.\nwww.NSA.gov/cybersecurity\n\nand security improvements we make together, \nscale far beyond defense contractors. For \nexample, we reach a cumulative, estimated \n2 billion endpoints through sharing info to \ntechnology providers and cybersecurity \ncompanies.\nWe arent just throwing our partners an IP \naddress over our barbed-wire fences, either. \nIn the last year, weve performed 10,000 \nrobust bidirectional exchanges through our \nCCC. We work with industry to investigate the \nunknown and our partners often take actions \nthat have global implications, such as issuing \npatches for zero-day vulnerabilities before \nour adversaries can perform widespread \nexploitation. \nThese efforts are critical because our \nadversaries are conducting increasingly \nsophisticated and broad intrusions with \nconsequences that transcend international \nborders. For our most important secrets, they \nwill go to significant lengths and we must \ndefend with rigor and depth.\nWe must form collaborative campaigns \nto counter nation-state and cybercriminal \nthreats that put our national security at risk. \nThey have to combat immediate threats like \nRussia as well as pervasive threats like China. \nOur aptly-named Adversary Defeat team is \nleading the charge in this area by collaborating \nwith our interagency partners to generate \noutcomes against our highest priority threats. \nWe work across a wide array of departments \nand agencies, each with unique, complemen -\ntary authorities, capabilities, and cultures. When we each come to the table with a \nshared objective, we can disrupt and degrade \nmalicious cyber activity. \nAs the scope of malicious cyber incidents and \nthe sophistication of our adversaries grow, \nit will take a unified public-private sector \nstrategy to gain the competitive advantage \nin this environment. \nOur power is in partnerships. Strategic \ncollaboration across security and intelligence \nspheres, and across classified and unclassified \nsettings, results in increased speed and agility.\nWe are preparing for the transition to \nquantum-resistant cryptography to protect \nourselves into the future. That protection not \nonly goes into our networks, but the weapons \nplatforms and other technology we rely on. \nWe have to recognize networked computers \nare in every facet of our environment and \nchange culture to secure all of them. Tools \nlike National Security Memorandum 8 that \ngive directive authorities to improve the \ncybersecurity of National Security Systems \nare improvements that enable such action.\nCybersecurity is national security and we \nall have an important role to play. We need \nleaders who recognize the threat, drive a \nculture that emphasizes robust security, and \nlean on partnerships. Leaders must emphasize \na culture of cybersecurity and provide their \nteams with resources to secure their systems. \nWe need cybersecurity at scale. \nRegards,\nRob Joyce\nRob Joyce \nDirector, NSA CybersecurityBy protecting our most \nsensitive networks,  \nwe help protect yours.\n3\nLETTER FROM THE NSA CYBERSECURITY DIRECTOR\n  Find us on social media: @NSACyber \n\nRESPONDING TO NATIONAL \nTHREATS AND PRIORITIES\nThe combined talent of our partners \nis the greatest competitive advantage \nwe have to confront the increasingly \nsophisticated threats to our nation. \nThrough partnerships, we bolster  \nand enable defense, and disrupt  \nand degrade adversary activities.\nGeneral Paul M. Nakasone, \nCommander, U.S. Cyber Command, \nDirector, NSA/Chief, CSSCOUNTERING GLOBAL THREATS\nNSA and its U.S. and international partners \nscale impact against global threats by \ncollaborating on coordinated responses. \nWhile the U.S. Government relies on NSAs \nunique foreign signals intelligence insights to \ninform key decisions, each private and public \nsector partner builds on that foundation to \ncreate a more comprehensive understanding \nof the threat and what should be done to \ncounter it. \nEach partner also brings their own unique \nauthorities and capabilities to the fight. This \nenhances our collective ability to prevent \nand eradicate some of the worlds most \nconcerning cyber threats.NSA joined U.S. partners  the Cybersecurity \nand Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), \nU.S. Cyber Command, and the Departments \nof Justice, State and Treasury  as well \nas international partners  the Australian \nCyber Security Centre, the UKs National \nCyber Security Centre, and Canadas Communications Security Establishment \nand Canadian Centre for Cyber Security  to \npublish a Cybersecurity Advisory to disrupt \nand degrade a multi-year global ransomware \nthreat that affected hundreds of organizations.\nIranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \n(IRGC)-Affiliated Cyber Actors were exploiting \npublicly known vulnerabilities to gain access \nto networks around the globe. The malicious \nstate-sponsored actors then encrypted 4\nNSA CYBERSECURITY | 2022 YEAR IN REVIEW\nwww.NSA.gov/cybersecurity\n\ninformation and extorted data to support \nransom operations. The actors victimized a \nbroad range of organizations, including small \nbusinesses, government agencies, nonprofit \nprograms, and educational and religious \ninstitutions. Their victims also included \nmultiple critical infrastructure sectors,\nincluding health care, transportation services, \nand utility providers.\nOn September 14, the international coalition \nreleased,  Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard \nCorps-Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting \nVulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disc \nEncryption for Ransom Operations. The \nCybersecurity Advisory alerted network \ndefenders of the threat and armed them to \ndefend against it. The advisory shared the \nactors tactics, techniques, and procedures \n(TTPs)  mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK \nframework  and provided guidance on how \nto detect and mitigate against the threat. Because hundreds of companies, organizations, \nand institutions were compromised around \nthe globe, the advisory was shared with \nU.S. and international victims directly and \npartners amplified the guidance upon release \nto prompt net defenders to act.\nOn the same day, U.S. partners held the actors \nand the Iranian government responsible for \ntheir malicious behavior and their failure to \nobserve international cyber norms. \nThe Department of Justice unsealed\nan indictment charging three Iranian\nnationals with engaging in ransomware-\nstyle extortion against U.S. critical\ninfrastructure providers.\nThe Department of Treasurys Office of\nForeign Assets Control sanctioned 10\nactors and two entities.\nThe Department of State Rewards for\nJustice released a notification offering\na reward of up to $10 million for\ninformation on three IRGC employees.\nBy increasing awareness and helping to \nsecure systems, NSA and its partners \ndegraded the malicious activity. \nIranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-affiliated actors were planning to ransom Boston \nChildrens Hospital, according to the FBI.  \n PHOTO COURTESY OF JOSEPH BARILLARI\nThe State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for info on three IRGC-\naffiliated actors.

In June, NSA partnered with \nFBI and CISA to release the Cybersecurity Advisory , Peoples Republic of China State-\nSponsor\ned Cyber Actors Exploit Network \nProviders and Devices.\nThe advisory discusses how PRC actors have \nes\ntablished a broad network of compromised \ninfrastructure. Theyve compromised major \nt\nelecommunications companies and network \nservice providers primarily by exploiting \npublicly known vulnerabilities. \nThe details in this advisory make it clear that \nnetw\nork devices, including small office/home \noffice (SOHO) routers and network attached \nstorage devices, can be a security risk and \nshould \nbe secured by patching and disabling \nunnecessary ports and protocols.\nNSA released a Cybersecurity Advisory that highlighted how Peoples Republic of China actors were exploiting network service providers and their devices. \n7\nRESPONDING TO NATIONAL THREATS AND PRIORITIES\n  Find us social media: @NSACyber \n\nwww.NSA.gov/cybersecurity\n\nPARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY\n\nOur partnership with industry goes \nbeyond intelligence sharing.  \nIts better defined as operational \ncollaboration.

NSA brings unique resources \nto the fight: Its foreign signals intelligence \n(SIGINT) system and cybersecurity operations \nacross National Security Systems (NSS) \ngenerates unique insights into nation-state \nintentions and capabilities in cyber. At the \nCCC, NSA fuses those insights with those \nfrom private-sector partners to deliver intel-\ndriven cybersecurity that protects the nation \nand U.S. allies.\nThe CCC defends the U.S. Defense Industrial \nBase (DIB) and disrupts the adversary by \nsharing timely threat intelligence with high-\nimpact partners, best positioned to scale \ndetection and mitigation techniques to \nbillions of endpoints. \nIn 2022, the CCC nearly tripled its partnerships, \ngrowing from 110 partners to more than \n300 collaborative relationships. The CCCs \npartners now reach a cumulative, estimated \n2 billion endpoints, and its DIB prime partners account for 80 percent of Department of \nDefense (DoD) acquisition spending. \nIn the past year, the CCC also doubled its \nanalytical exchanges with these partners. \nThanks to more than 10,000 bidirectional \ncollaborations  primarily focused on Russian \nand Peoples Republic of China (PRC) cyber \nthreats and responding to world events  \nbillions of endpoints have been hardened \nagainst nation-state threats. \nFor  example, if NSA shares a nation-state \nactors malware or tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures (TTPs) with an internet service/\ncloud provider with a global footprint, the \nprovider can develop and deploy signatures \nto defend against the threat at scale. While \nthe CCCs primary goal is to defend the DIB, \nits efforts cascade protection across all 16 \nU.S. critical infrastructure sectors, reach \nbusinesses and consumers, and even protect \nour allies. \nIn late 2020, NSA opened the \nCybersecurity Collaboration Center, \nan unclassified facility outside the \nNSA-Washington fence line. This \nyear, the CCC expanded to four new \nsatellite locations: Georgia, Texas, Hawaii, and the United Kingdom. \n9\n  Find us on social media: @NSACyber PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY\n\n\nDISCLOSING ZERO-DAY \nVULNERABILITIES\nTo see how NSAs partnerships help secure \nthe world, look no further than its work to \ndiscover and disclose vulnerabilities in core \ntechnology products. In 2022, the CCC \ndisclosed dozens of zero-day vulnerabilities \nto vendors, ensuring dangerous bugs can be \nremediated.\nFor example, the CCC partnered with the \nUnited Kingdoms National Cyber Security \nCenter (NCSC) this year to jointly disclose a \ncritical cryptographic vulnerability in Microsoft \nWindows. The vulnerability could allow \nattackers to manipulate public certificates \nthat spoof their identity and perform actions \nsuch as authentication or code signing. \nIn the hands of a capable adversary, the flaw \ncould have very potent impacts. Thanks to \nthe power of NSAs industry and international \npartnerships, the vulnerability was quickly \ndisclosed to Microsoft and patched for all users running supported versions of Windows \nthrough automatic updates.\nThis w as the f irst  joint vulnerability d isclosure \nbetween NSA and an international partne r.\nSCALING DIB DEFENSE\nTo protect sensitive U.S. Government \ninformation, combat the PRCs theft of \nintellectual propert y, and ensure small-to-\nmedium-size businesses (SMBs) benefit from \nstrong cyber hygiene, the CCC provides NSA-\nmanaged, no-cost cybersecurity services to \nmore than 150 \nenrollees.

It also positioned NSA to \nset priorities  such as requiring that NSS \nowners mitigate against a vulnerability being \nexploited by our adversaries  and direction \n such as requiring that owners employ \nproven cybersecurity solutions like \nmultifactor authentication. This increased responsibility led NSA to form \neven closer relationships with the more than \n50 departments and agencies across the U.S. \nGovernment that own or operate NSS. \nNSA established foundational policies, \nprocedures, and workflows to improve the cybersecurity posture of critical U.S. \nGovernment systems, created inventories and \ndatabases to capture data, and supported \nU.S. Government efforts to update the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense \nFederal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, and other cyber-related directives.\nSince the memo was signed, NSA has released \nnearly two dozen directives and memoranda \nleveraging the new authorities to improve the \ncybersecurity of NSS on topics such as:\nThe process for identifying andinventorying critical NSS andnon-compliant cryptography\nThe requirements for implementingmultifactor authenticationand data encryption\nMitigations for identified threatsto or vulnerabilities within cross-domain solutions, VMware,and Atlassian Confluence\n19\nDEFENDING OUR MOST CRITICAL NETWORKS\n  Find us on social media: @NSACyber \n\nThrough partnerships with other federal \nagencies, increased visibility within the \nnational security community, and increased \nauthorities to mandate vulnerability \nremediation, NSA is drastically increasing the \nsecurity of critical U.S. Government systems  \nprotecting sensitive military and intelligence data from our adversaries.\nRAISING THE BAR ON  \nCROSS- DOMAIN SOLUTIONS\nCross-domain solutions allow information to \nbe shared across international, government, \nagency, and classification boundaries through controlled interfaces.

It focuses on improving cross-\ndomain solution security and capabilities for \nNSS in the stages of design, development, \nassessment, and implementation. \nNSA significantly accelerated Raise the Bar \ncompliance in 2022, while working closely with \nthe vendor community on the development \nof remote management (RMAN) and remote \nmonitoring (RMON) capabilities. Several of \nthese products have entered the lab-based \nsecurity assessment process for projected \navailability to the community in 2023. This \nincreased capability will continue to improve \nthe security posture of the greater NSS \nthrough better management and monitoring. ADVOCATING FOR  \nZERO TRUST, CLOUD\nTraditional cybersecurity centered on a \nperimeter-defense model is ineffective \nagainst malicious cyber actors. Once inside \nthe network, the actors can move laterally, \nescalate privileges, and compromise the mission. The only way to protect critical \nresources is through a data-centric model. \nZero trust is a cybersecurity strategy and \nframework that embeds security throughout \nthe architecture for the purpose of preventing, \ndetecting, and responding to data breaches. \nThis security model eliminates the idea of trusted or untrusted networks, devices, \npersonas, or processes and instead constantly \ninterrogates the trust relationships formed by \nentities on the network and denies access by \ndefault, only allowing access by an approved \nuser and device. \nTo demonstrate the efficacy of zero trust \narchitectures in a government environment, and to enable NSA to publish well-informed \nguidance to the community, NSA built the \nNative Zero Trust Cloud (NZTC) environment \n a private cloud that implements zero \ntrust principles at the advanced level of the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Maturity Model. \nNSAs zero trust experts also partnered with the DoD CIO, Defense Information \nSystems Agency (DISA), Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and \nsubject matter experts from across the U.S. \nGovernment and industry to provide guidance to national-level strategies and roadmaps, and \npublish reference architectures for successful \nimplementation.

NSA is continually modernizing its cybersecurity solutions to be agile, threat \nadaptive, and scalable across multi-domain \noperations. A few 2022 modernization \nsuccesses include: \nNSA delivered another set of updatedcryptographic devices that implement\nNSA-approved government off-the-\nshelf quantum-resistant algorithms to\nprotect NSS from potential adversarial\nquantum computing attacks. The initial\nset was delivered in 2021. While a CRQC\nremains theoretical, the development\nand use of one could make keyportions of the U.S. cryptographic\ninventory obsolete.\nNSA certified 21 high assurance cryp -\ntographic solutions in 2022, afterensuring that security requirements, tailored for each solution, were met. \nMany of these products are upgrades \nto strengthen the security of existing \ndevices such as multichannel radios, tactical receivers, data links, and the \nGPS IIIF satellites.
