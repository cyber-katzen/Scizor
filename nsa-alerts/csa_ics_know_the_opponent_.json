These c yber actors, including advanced \npersistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets  to achieve  political gains, \neconomic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS  systems manage \nphysical operational processes, cyber actors operations could result in  physical \nconsequences, including loss of life, property  damage, and disruption of National \nCritical Functions . \nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, \noften incorporate vulnerable information technology \n(IT) components, and include external connections \nand remote  access that increase their attack \nsurfaces. In addition, a multitude of tools are readily \navailable to exploit IT and OT systems. As a result of \nthese factors, malicious cyber actors present an \nincreasing risk to ICS networks.  Traditional \napproaches to \nsecuring OT/ICS do \nnot adequately \naddress current \nthreats .  \nTraditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats  to \nthose systems . However, owners and operators who understand cyber actors tactics, \ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) can use that knowledge when prioritizing hardening \nactions for OT/ICS.  \nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory , which builds on previous NSA and CISA guidance  to \nstop malicious ICS activity  and reduce OT exposure  [1] [2], describes TTPs  that \nmalicious actors use to compromise OT/ICS assets . It also recommends mitigations  that \nowners and operators can use to defend their systems . NSA and CISA encourage \nOT/ICS owners and operators to apply the recommendations in this CSA .  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  2 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \nTechnica l Details  \nOT/ICS assets operate, control , and monitor industrial processes throughout U.S. \ncritical infrastructure. Traditional ICS assets are difficult to secure due to their design f or \nmaximum availability and safety, coupled with their use of decades -old systems that \noften lack any recent security updates. Newer ICS assets  may be able to be configured \nmore securely, but often have an increased attack surface due to incorporating Inte rnet \nor IT network connectivity to facilitate  remote control and operations. The net effect of \nthe convergence of IT and OT platforms has increased the risk of cyber exploitation of \ncontrol systems . [3] \nTodays cyber realm is filled with w ell-funded malicious cyber actors financed by nation -\nstate s, as well as less sophisticated groups, independent hackers, and insider threats . \nControl systems have been targeted by a variety of these  malicious cyber actors  in \nrecent years to achieve political gains, economic advantages , and possibly destructive \neffects . [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] More recently, APT actors have also developed tools for \nscanning , compromis ing, and controlling targeted  OT devices . [9]  \nMalicious actors game plan for control system  intrusion s \nCyber actors typically follow these steps to plan and execute compromises against \ncritical infrastructure control systems : \n1. Establish intended effect and select a target.   \n2. Collect intelligence about the target system.   \n3. Develop techniques  and tools to navigate and manipulate the system.  \n4. Gain initial access to the system.  \n5. Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effect.  \nLeveraging specific expertise and network knowledge, malicious actors especially \nstate -sponsored ones can conduct these steps in a coordinated manner, sometimes \nconcurrently and repeatedly , as illustrated by  real world  cyber activity . [5] [10]\nEstablish intended effect and select a target  \nCyber actors, from cyber criminals to  state -sponsored APT actors, target critical  \ninfrastructure to achieve a variety of objectives.  Cyber criminals are financially \nmotivated and target OT/ICS assets for financial gain (e.g., data extortion  or \nransomware  operations). State -sponsored APT actors target critical infrastructure for \n\n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  3 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \npolitical and/or military objectives, such as destabiliz ing political or economic \nlandscapes  or causing  psychological or social impacts on a population . The cyber actor \nselects the target and intended effect to disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/ or \ndestroy based on these objectives.  For example, disabling power grids in strategic \nlocations could destabilize economic landscapes or support broader military campaigns. \nDisru pting water treatment facilities or threatening to destroy a dam could have \npsychological or social impacts on a population . [11] [12]\nCollect intelligence about the target system   \nOnce the intent and target are established, the actor collects intelligence on  \nthe targeted control system. The actor may collect data from multiple sources, including:  \n Open -source research:  A great deal of information about control systems and \ntheir designs is publicly available. For example, s olicitation  information  and \nemployment advertisements  may indicate compo nents, and list specific model \nnumbers.  \n Insider threats:  The actor may also leverage trusted insiders, even unwitting \nones, for collecting information. Social engineering often  elicits a wealth of \ninformation from people looking for a new job or even just trying to help.  \n Enterprise networks:  The actor may compromise enterprise IT networks and \ncollect and exfiltrate ICS-related information . Procurement documents, \nengineering specifications, and even configurations may be  stored on corporate \nIT networks.  \nIn addition to OT -specific intelligence, i nformation about IT technologie s used in control \nsystem s is widely available. Knowledge that was once limited to control system \nengineer s and OT operators has become easily available as IT technolog ies move into \nmore of the control system environment. Control system vendors, in conjunction with \nthe owner/operator community, have continually optimized and reduced the cost of \nengineering, operating, and maintaining control systems  by incorporating more  \ncommodity IT components and technologies  in some parts of OT environments . These \nadvancements can make  more information about some systems easily available , \nthereby increasing the risk of cyber exploitation . \n\n\n  \n \nU/OO/## | PP -22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  | Cybersecurity Advisory  \nCybersecurity and \nInfrastructure \nSecurity Agency  \nNational  \nSecurity  \nAgency  TLP: WHITE  \n4 Develop  techniques  and tools  \nUsing the intelligence collected about the control systems design, a cyber  \nactor may procure systems that are similar to the target and configure them as mock -up \nversions for practice purposes. Nation -state actors can easily obtain most control \nsystem equipment. Groups with limited means can still often acquire control systems \nthrough willing vendors and secondhand resellers.  \nAccess to a mock -up of the t arget system enables an actor to determine the most \neffective tools and techniques. A cyber actor can leverage resident system utilities, \navailable exploitation tools, or, if necessary, develop or purchase custom tools to affect \nthe control system. Utiliti es that are already on the system can be used to reconfigure \nsettings and may have powerful troubleshooting capabilities.  \nAs the control system community has incorporated \ncommodity IT and modernized OT, the community  \nhas simplified the tools, techniques, scripts, and \nsoftware packages used in control systems.  As a \nresult, a  multitude of convenient tools are readily \navailable to exploit IT and OT systems.  A multitude of tools is \nreadily available to \nexploit IT and OT \nsystems.  \nActors may also develop custom ICS -focused malware based on their knowledge of the \ncontrol systems. For example, TRITON malware  was designed to target certain \nversions of Triconex Tricon programmable logic controllers (PLCs)  by modifying in -\nmemory firmware to add additional programming. The extra functionality allows an actor  \nto read/modify memory contents and execute custom code, disabling the safety system.  \n[13] APT actors have also developed tools to scan for, compromise, and control certain \nSchneider Electric PLCs, OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and Open Platform \nCommunications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers. [9]  \nWith TTPs in place, a cyber actor is prepared to  do virtually anything that a normal \nsystem operator can, and potentially much more.\nGain initial access  to the system  \nTo leverage the techniques and tools that the y developed and practiced,  \ncyber actors  must first gain access to the targeted system. Most modern control  \n\n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  5 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \nsystems maintain remote access capabilities allowing vendors, integrators , service \nproviders, owners, and operators access to the system. Remote access enables these \nparties to perform remote monitoring services, diagnose problems remotely, and verify \nwarranty agreements.  \nHowever, these access points often have poor security p ractices , such as using default \nand maintenance passwords. Malicious cyber actors can leverage these access points \nas vectors to covertly gain access to the system, exfiltrate data, and launch other cyber \nactivities before an operator realizes there is a p roblem. Malicious actors can use web -\nbased search platforms, such as Shodan, to identify these exposed access points.  \nVendor access to control systems typically uses connections that create a bridge \nbetween control system networks and external environment s. Often unknown  to the \nowner/operator, t his bridge provides yet another path for cyber exploitation and allows  \ncyber actors  to take advantage of vulnerabilities in other infrastructure to gain access to \nthe control system.  \nRemote access points and methodologies use a variety of  access and communication \nprotocols. Many are nothing more than vendor -provided dial -up modems and network \nswitches protected only by obscurity and passwords. Some are dedicated devices and \nservices th at communicate via more secure virtual private networks (VPNs) and \nencryption. Few, if any, offer robust cybersecurity capabilities to protect the control \nsystem access points or prevent the transmission of acquired data outside the relatively \nsecure envir onment of the isolated control system. This access to an ostensibly closed \ncontrol system can be used to exploit the network and components.\nExecute techniques and tools to create the intended  effects  \nOnce an actor gains initial access to targeted OT/ICS s ystem, the actor will  \nexecute techniques, tools, and malware to achieve the intended effects on the target \nsystem. To disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy  the system, the malicious \nactor often perform s, in any order or in combination, the following activities:  \n1. Degrade  the operator's ability to monitor the target ed system  or degrade the \noperators confidence in the control systems ability to operate, control , and \nmonitor the targeted  system.  Functionally, an act or could p revent the operator's \ndisplay ( human machine interface, or HMI ) from being updated and selectively \n\n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  6 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \nupdat e or chang e visualizations on the HMI , as witnessed during the attack on \nthe Ukraine power grid. [5] (Manipulation of View  [T0832 ]1) \n2. Operate the targeted control system. Functionally, this includes the ability to \nmodify analog and di gital values internal to the system (changing alarms and \nadding or modifying user accounts), or to change output control points  this \nincludes abilities such as altering tap changer output signals, turbine speed \ndemand, and opening and closing breakers . (Manipulation of Control [ T0831 ]) \n3. Impair the system's ability to report data.  Functionally, this is accomplished by  \ndegrading or disrupting communications with e xternal communications circuits \n(e.g., ICCP2, HDLC3, PLC4, VSAT, SCADA radio, other radio frequency  \nmediums) , remote terminal units (RTUs) or programmable logic controllers \n(PLCs), c onnected b usiness  or corporate networks , HMI subnetwork s, other \nremote I/O, and any connected Historian/ bulk data storage.  (Block Reporting \nMessage [ T0804 ], Denial of View  [T0815 ]) \n4. Deny the operator's ability to control  the targeted system. Function ally, this \nincludes the ability to stop , abort , or corrupt the systems operating system (OS) \nor the  supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) systems software \nfunctionality.  (Denial of Control  [T0813 ]) \n5. Enable remote or local reconnaissance on the control system.  Functionally, a n \nactor could obtain system configuration information to enable development of a \nmodified system configuration or a custom tool . (Collection [ TA0100 ], Theft of \nOperational Information  [T0882 ]) \nUsing these techniques , cyber actors  could cause various physic al consequences. They \ncould open or close b reakers , throttle valves, overfill tanks, set turbines to over -speed, \nor place plants in unsafe operating conditions. Additionally , cyber actors  could \nmanipulate the  control environment , obscuring operator awarene ss and obstructing \nrecovery , by locking interfaces and setting monitors to show normal conditions.  Actors \ncan even suspend a larm functionality, allowing the system to operate under unsafe \nconditions without alerting the operator. Even when physical safety systems should \nprevent catastrophic physical consequences, more limited effects are possible and \n                                            \n1 T-codes correspond to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  \n2 ICCP  Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol  \n3 HDLC  High-Level Data Link Control Protocol  \n4 PLC  Power Line Carrier  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  7 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \ncould be sufficient to meet the actors intent . In some scenarios  though , if an actor \nsimultaneously manipulates multiple parts of the system, the physical saf ety systems \nmay not be enough. Impacts  to the  system  could be temporary or permanent , potentially \neven including  physical destr uction of  equipment . \nMitigations  \nThe complexity of balancing network security with performance, features, ease -of-use, \nand availa bility can be overwhelming for owner/o perator s. This is especially true where \nsystem tools and scripts enable ease -of-use and increase availability  or functionality of \nthe control network ; or when equipment vendors require remote access for warrant y \ncompli ance, service obligations , and financial/billing functionality.  However, with the \nincrease in targeting of OT/ICS by malicious actors, owner/operators should be more \ncognizant of the risks when making these balancing decisions. Owner/operators  should \ncaref ully consider what information about their systems needs to be publicly available \nand determine if each external connection is truly needed . [1]  \nSystem owners and operators cannot prevent a malicious actor from targeting their \nsystems. Understanding that being targeted is no t an if but a when  is essential \ncontext for making ICS security decisions . By assuming that the system is being \ntargeted and predicting the effects that a malicious actor would intend to cause , \nowner/operator s can prioritize  and employ  mitigation actions.  \nHowever, the variety of available security solutions can also be intimidating, resulting in \nchoice paralysis. In the midst of so many option s, owner/operators may be unable to \nincorporate simple security and administrative strategies that could mitigate many of the \ncommon and realistic threats. Fortunately, owner/operators can apply a few \nstraightforward ICS security best practices to counter adversary TTPs.  \nLimit exposure of system information  \nOperational and system information and configuration data is a key element of critical \ninfrastructure operations. The importance of keeping such data confidential cannot be \noverstated. To the extent pos sible, avoid disclosing information about system hardware, \nfirmware, and software in any public forum.  Incorporate information protection education \ninto training for personnel.  Limit information that is sent out from the system.  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  8 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \nDocument the answers to the  following questions:  \n1. From where and to where is data flowing?  \n2. How are the communication pathways documented and how is the data \nsecured/encrypted?  \n3. How is the data used and secured when it arrives at its destination?  \n4. What are the network security standards at the data destination, whether a \nvendor/regulator or administrator/financial institution?  \n5. Can the data be shared further once at its destination? Who has the authority to \nshare this data?  \nEliminate all other data destinations. Share only the  data necessary to comply with \napplicable legal requirements, such as those contractually required  by vendors \nnothing more. Do not allow other uses of the data and other accesses to the system \nwithout strict administrative policies designed specifically to protect the data. Prevent \nnew connections to the control system using strict administrative accountability. Ensure \nstrict agreements are in place with outside systems/vendors when it comes to sharing, \naccess, and use. Have strong policies for the destruction of such data. Audit policies \nand procedures to verify compliance  and secure the  data once it gets to its destination, \nand determine who actually has access to it.  \nIdentify and secure remote access points  \nOwner/operators must maintain detailed knowledge of all installed systems, including \nwhich remote access points are or could be operating in the control syst em network. \nCreating a full connectivity inventory is a critical  step in securing access to the system.  \nMany vendor -provided devices maintain these access capabilities as an auxiliary \nfunction and may have services that will automatically phone home in  an attempt to \nregister and update software or firmware. A vendor may also have multiple access \npoints to cover different tasks.  \nOnce owner/operators have identified all remote access points on their systems, they \ncan implement the following recommendatio ns to improve  their security posture:  \n Reduce the attack surface by proactively limiting and hardening Internet -exposed \nassets. See CISAs Get Your Stuff Off Search  page for more information.  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  9 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \n Establish a firewall and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the control system \nand the vendors access points and devices. Do not allow direct access into the \nsystem; use an intermediary service to share only necessary data and only when \nrequired. For mor e information see CISAs infographic Layering Network Security \nThrough Segmentation . [14] \n Consider using virtual private networks (VPNs) at specific points to and from the \nsystem rather than allowing separate access points for individual devices or \nvendors.  \n Utilize jump boxes to isolate a nd monitor access to the system.  \n Ensure that data can only flow outward from the system  administratively and \nphysically. Use encrypted links to exchange data outside of the system.  \n Enforce strict compliance with policies and procedures for remote access,  even if \npersonnel complain  that it is too difficult . \n If the system does not use vendor access points and devices, ensure that none \nare active. Use strict hardware, software, and administrative techniques to \nprevent them from becoming covertly active.  \n Do n ot allow vendor -provided system access devices and software to operate \ncontinuously in the system without full awareness of their security posture and \naccess logs.  \n Install and keep current all vendor -provided security systems associated with the \ninstalled vendor access points.  \n Review configurations to ensure they are configured securely . Operators typically \nfocus on necessary functionality, so properly securing the configurations and \nremote access may be overlooked.  \n Consider penetration testing to validate  the systems security posture and any \nunknown accesses or access vulnerabilities.   \n Add additional security features to the system as needed. Do not assume that \none vendor has a monopoly on the security of their equipment; other vendors \nmay produce securit y features to fill gaps.  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  10 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \n Change all default passwords throughout  the system  and update any products \nwith hard -coded passwords , especially in all remote access and security \ncomponents . \n Patch known exploited vulnerabilities whenever possible. Prioritize timely \npatching of all remote access points. Keep operating systems, firewalls, and all \nsecurity features up -to-date.  \n Continually monitor remote access logs for suspicious accesses. Securely  \naggregate logs for easier monitoring.  \nRestrict tools and scripts  \nLimit a ccess to network and control system application tools and scripts to legitimate \nusers performing legitimate tasks on the control system. Removing the tools and scripts \nentirely and patching embedded control system components for exploitable \nvulnerab ilities is often not feasible. Thus, carefully apply access and use limitations to \nparticularly vulnerable processes and components to limit the threat.  \nThe control system and any accompanying vendor access points may have been \ndelivered with engineering, configuration, and diagnostic tools pre -installed. Engineers \nuse these tools to configure and modify the system and its processes as needed. \nHowever, such tools  can also be used by a malicious actor to manipulate the system, \nwithout needing any special add itional tools. Using the system against itself is a \npowerful cyber exploitation technique. Mitigations strategies include:  \n1. Identify any engineering, configuration, or diagnostic tools.  \n2. Securely store gold copies of these tools external to the system if pos sible.  \n3. Remove all non -critical tools.  \n4. Prevent these tools from being reinstalled.  \n5. Perform routine audits to check that these tools have not been reinstalled.  \nConduct regular s ecurity audits  \nThe owner/ operator  of the control system should consider performin g an independent \nsecurity audit of the sy stem, especially of  third-party vendor access points and systems. \nThe owner/ operator  cannot solely depend on the views, options , and guidance of the \nvendor/integrator that designed, developed, or sold the system. Th e goal  of such an \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  11 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \naudit  is to identify and document system vulnerabilities, practices , and procedures that \nshould be eliminated to improve the cyber defensive posture , and ultimately prevent \nmalicious cyber actors from being able to cause their intended ef fects . Steps to consider \nduring an audit include  the following:  \n1. Validate all connections ( e.g., network, serial, modem, wireless, etc.).  \n2. Review  system software patching procedures.  \n3. Confirm  secure storage of gold copies ( e.g., OS, firmware, patches, \nconfigu rations, etc.).  \n4. Verify removal from the system of  all non -critical software , services , and tools . \n5. Audit the full asset inventory.  \n6. Implement CISA ICS mitigation s and best practices . [15] [16] \n7. Monitor system logs and intrusion detection system ( IDS) logs.  \nMonitoring of access logs, system changes, IDS logs, and other tracking data should be \nperformed continuously, with a deeper look at this data during periodic audits.  \nImplement a dynamic network environment  \nStatic network environments provide malicious act ors with  persistent knowledge of the \nsystem. A static network can provide cyber actors the opportunity to collect bits of \nintelligence about the system over time, establish long-term access es into the system,  \nand develop the tools and TTPs to affect the co ntrol system as intended.   \nWhile it may be unrealistic for the administrators of many OT/ICS environments to make \nregular non -critical changes, owner/operators should consider periodically making  \nmanageable network changes. A little change can go a long wa y to disrupt previously \nobtained access by a malicious actor . Consider the following:  \n1. Deploy additional firewalls and routers from different vendors.  \n2. Modify IP address pools.  \n3. Replace outdated hardware ( e.g., workstations, servers, printer s, etc.) . \n4. Upgrade operating systems.  \n5. Install or upgrade commercially available security packages for vendor access \npoints and methodologies.  \n\n \n \nU/OO /200431 -22 | PP-22-1413  | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0  12 NSA, CISA  | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent  TLP: WHITE  \n \nPlanning these changes with significant forethought can help minimize the impact on \nnetwork operation.  \nOwner /operator s should familia rize themselves with the risk s to the system as outlined  \nby the product vendor . These may be described in manuals as the system using \ninsecure protocols for interoperability or certain configurations that may expose the \nsystem in additional ways. Changes t o the system to reduce these risks should be \nconsidered and implemented when feasible.  \nConclusion  \nThe combination of integrated, simplified tools and remote access es creates an \nenvironment ripe for  malicious actors to  target control systems networks. New I T-\nenabled accesses provide cyber actors with a larger attack surface into cyber -physical \nenvironment s. It is vital for OT/ICS defenders to anticipate the TTPs of cyber actors  \ncombining IT  expertise with engineering know -how.
