The private cloud, often referred to as an on -prem ises (on -prem)  \nsolution, is an infrastructure provisioned for use by a single company , whereas the \npublic cl oud is provisioned for general use  by many organizations . A multi -cloud \nenvironment , on the other hand, provisions multiple offerings  from different cloud \nservice providers . Organizations  often find themselves using  one or both of thes e \nsolutions when depl oying their infrastructures  to the cloud.  \nThis cybersecurity information sheet addresses the complications that may arise when \nimplementing hybrid cloud and multi -cloud environments due to increased complexity  \nand solutions to mitigate them . \n \n\n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126161 -24 | PP-24-0103  | March 2024  Ver. 1.0 2 \nNSA | Account for Complexities Introduced b y Hybrid Cloud and Multi -Cloud E nvironments  \nAddressing common complexities  \nMaintaining multiple cloud environments can become a burdensome  task, especially for \norganizations new to the cloud.  This includes the difficulties of:  \n Learning  the operations of various vendors  \n Maintaining data flows  between clouds  \n Controlling user access  \n Lacking unified visibility into cloud resources  \n Maintaining compliance  \n General lack of cloud security expertise . [1] \nThe following sections highlight these issues along with other  complex tasks  and \nassociated security recommendations for IT professionals to securely address them.   \nOperational complexities  \nNo two cloud environments are alike. Public cloud options tend to differ vastly , not only \nfrom private cloud infrastructures , but also  from each other as well, often resulting in \nknowledge and skill gaps  in the deployment and management process . Multi -cloud \nenvironments may also lead to operational siloes, where single teams or indivi duals \nmaintain just  one environment , causing configuration discrepancies between \nenvironments that may lead  to exploitable security gaps. [2] \nStandardizing cloud operations will resolve some operational complexities. Vendor \nagnostic infrastructure  as code (IaC) solutions can be used to deploy hybrid  cloud and \nmulti -cloud infrastruc tures from a centralized location. Refer to Enforce Secure \nAutomated Deployment Practices through Infrastructure as Code  for more information  \non IaC best practices. Unified management solution s are also available to provide  cloud \nadministrator s the ability  to manage and monitor infrastructure resources from a central \nlocation.  Administrators should familiarize themselves with the cloud offering s in their \nenvironment to avoid gaps in skillsets. Cloud training should be ongoing to maintain a \ngood security posture.  \nNetwork protections  \nIn hybrid  cloud  and multi -cloud environments , there are sometimes multiple  data flow s \nbetween the environments. A Zero Trust  approach should be taken by minimizing the \nflows between environments, only allowing paths  as defined by organiza tional policies , \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126161 -24 | PP-24-0103  | March 2024  Ver. 1.0 3 \nNSA | Account for Complexities Introduced b y Hybrid Cloud and Multi -Cloud E nvironments  \nand verifying all identities involved before allowing connection  attempts . A \nmisconfigured network can lead to data breaches across multiple cloud tenants and \npotentially a customers on -prem environment  as well . All network communications \nshould use Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite approved  algorithms . \n[3] Refer to Implement Network Segmentation and Encrypti on in Cloud Environments  \nfor additional network protection best practices.  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nCredential Access, Discovery  Network Sniffing [ T1040 ] \nDiscovery  Network Service Discovery [ T1046 ] \nDefense Evasion  Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions [ T1535 ] \nIdentity and Access Management  (IAM ) \nIdentity and access management differs across cloud vendors and is a challenge in \nhybrid  cloud and multi -cloud environments . Maintaining  user identities in separate \nenvironments or maintaining secure interoperation between providers , while also \nmaintaini ng the principle of least privilege , can be demanding .  \nIdentity management  \nIdentity servers are frequent targets for malicious cyber actors as they can be leveraged \nto retrieve user credentials that would grant access to on -prem and cloud environments. \nFederated identity is typically used for hybrid cloud and multi -cloud environments, \ngranting users access to multiple accounts and domains using a common set of \ncredentials. Account federation can be  managed on -prem by organizations or through \ncloud -based Id entity  as a Service (IDaaS) solutions.  \nComplexities in m aintaining on -prem identity solutions  may force organizations to turn to \nIDaaS as a centralized solution. While IDaaS  can be a viable option for maintaining \naccounts for multiple resources and makes user account activity more visible, it does \nrequire additional reliance on the vendor and can potentially serve as a single point of \nfailure for all accounts.  \nWhen deciding on the best solution for organization s, the authentication mechanism s \nand how authentication information is stored and protected should be considered, \nfollowing the guidelines presented in the NIST SP 800 -63 series on Digital Identity \nGuidelines . [4] Refer to Use Secure Cloud Identity and Access Management Practices  \nfor additional identity and access management guidance . \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126161 -24 | PP-24-0103  | March 2024  Ver. 1.0 4 \nNSA | Account for Complexities Introduced b y Hybrid Cloud and Multi -Cloud E nvironments  \nAccess management  \nCloud vendors typically use a role -based access control (RBAC) or an attribute -based \naccess control (ABAC) approach  for resource access management. Vendor -specific  \nIAM tools used for RBAC  and ABAC  are usually not scalable to other platforms as t he \nresource  definitions  are vendor specific . Ideally, when implementing hybrid cloud and \nmulti -cloud environments, access control policies should be uniformly defined, ensuring \nusers have the same level of access across accounts. M aintaining consistency in the \npolicies across multiple platforms , however,  may become cumbersome logistically, \ncausing confusion when assigning use r roles and potentially causing overly permissive \npolicies  to be overlooked . Infrastructure  as code (IaC) can be used to create, deploy, \nand maintain RBAC  and ABAC  policies for multiple cloud environments from a \ncentralized location.  \nWhether defined using an IaC solution or through vendor -specific tools, keep in mind \nthat vendors may handle privilege hierarchy differently , but the p rincip le of least \nprivilege should always be used  when granting access to all cloud and on -prem \nenvironme nts. IAM policies should be periodically audited to check for irregularities .  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nResource Development  Compromise Accounts: Cloud Accounts [ T1586.003 ] \nPersistence  Account Manipulation [ T1098 ] \nDefense Evasion, Credential \nAccess, Persistence  Modify Authentication Process [ T1556 ] \n \nD3FEND Tactic  Countermeasure  \nCredential Hardening  User Account Permissions [ D3-UAP] \nUser Behavior Analysis  Local Account Monitoring [ D3-LAM] \nLogging and monitoring  \nLogging and monitoring are essential tasks for proactively tracking cyber threats and \nshould be enabled for all environments in use. However, t hreat  hunting and keeping \ntrack of user activity in hybrid cloud and multi -cloud environments  can become difficult . \nThis is  due to lack of the skills or resources required to maintain constant visibility into \nmultiple environments at once , especially when monit oring activity between cloud \nenvironments .  \n\n \n \nU/OO/ 126161 -24 | PP-24-0103  | March 2024  Ver. 1.0 5 \nNSA | Account for Complexities Introduced b y Hybrid Cloud and Multi -Cloud E nvironments  \nFor real -time visibility, monitoring, and auditing for all environments, ingest  logs into a \ncentralized solution, such as Security Information and Event Management  (SIEM)  \nand/or Security Orchestr ation, Automation, and Response  (SOAR) technologies. The \naggregation of logs facilitates active monitoring and threat hunting from one location, \ngiving users the ability to write queries and create alerts without needing to replicate the \nsame activity in differen t environments.   \nThese solutions are often packaged with machine learning anomaly detection that can \nbe used to identify deviations from established behavioral patterns.  Refer to Manage \nCloud Logs for Effective Threat Hunting  for more information on logging best practices.  \nD3FEND Tactic  Countermeasure  \nUser Behavior Analysis  Local Account Monitoring [ D3-LAM] \nDisaster recovery  \nCloud providers  have their  own method s of disaster recovery for internal systems that \nmay impact the recovery objective for organization s. Multi -cloud so lutions are often \nused to circumvent issues that may arise in disaster recovery by allowing  organizations  \nto quickly spin up backups stored in a different cloud environment . When using multi -\ncloud solutions for disaster recovery efforts  of cloud assets , avoid vendor lock -in and \nhave redundancy across multiple cloud environments.  \nThough this approach may require addition al training to ensure service usage is \nunderstood across different environments, it helps ensure data is not lost if an outage or \ndestructi ve event  affects a CSP . Disaster recovery implementations should be regularly \ntested to en sure recovery expectations can be met if a real disaster  occurs .  \nATT&CK Tactic  Technique  \nImpact  Data Destruction [ T1485 ] \n \nD3FEND Tactic  Countermeasure  \nPlatform Monitoring  Endpoint Health Beacon [ D3-EHB] \nMaintaining compliance and governance  \nEnsuring compliance standards are met can be difficult in hybrid  cloud  and multi -cloud \nenvironments. Policy  as code, an IaC model, can be used to codify security and \ncompliance best practices across cloud accounts.

Consider implementing the following best practices to ensure cloud \nenvironments remain protected:  \n Use infrastruc ture as code to deploy infrastructure resources from a centralized \nlocation .  \n Ensure training is ongoing for all cloud environments in use to avoid gaps in \nskillsets . \n Minimize data flows between environments to paths necessary for day -to-day \nbusiness operations . \n Ensure CNSA Suite  approved algorithms are used . \n Follow NSA and NIST guidelines to determine the best IAM solution to meet \norganizational needs . \n Define access control policies uniformly to ensure user access is consistent \nacross all environments . \n Use a centralized solution to aggregate logs and facilitate active monitoring and \nthreat hunting . \n Avoid vendor lock -in and enable redundancy across multiple environments to \nease disaster recovery efforts  for cloud assets and resources . \n Codify security an d compliance best practices through policy  as code . \nFurther guidance  \nSupplementary NSA guidance on ensuring network environments are secure and \ndefendable is available at NSA Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance .
