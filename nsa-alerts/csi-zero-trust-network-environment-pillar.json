The Zero Trust network and environment pillar \ncurtails  adversarial lateral movement by employ ing controls and capabilities to logically \nand physically segment, isolate, and control access (on -premises and off -premises) \nthrough granular policy restrictions.   \nThe network and environment pillar works in concert with the other Zero Trust pillars as \npart of a holistic Zero Trust securit y model that assumes adversary breaches occur \ninside the network, and so limits , verifies , and monitors  activities  throughout the \nnetwork . \nThe concepts introduced in this cybersecurity information s heet provide guidance on \nenhancing existing network security controls to limit the potential impact of a \ncompromise through data flow mapping, macro and micro segmentation, and software \ndefined networking.  These capabilities enable host isolation, network segmentation, \nenforcement of encryption, and enterpr ise visibility. As organizations mature their \ninternal network control, they greatly improve their defense -in-depth posture and, \nconsequently, can better contain, detect, and isolate  network intrusions.  \n \n  \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  2 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nIntroduction  \nAccording to public report s, an Ameri can retail corporation  experienced a significant \ndata breach in 201 3 due to a lack of network segmentation . [1] Preceding the breach, \ncyber criminals  managed to acquire  the login credentials of a heating, ventilation, and \nair conditioning ( HVAC ) company that had been contracted by several of the retail \ncorporations store  locations. The locations  had granted the HVAC  company access to \nthe corporate  network to moni tor energy and temperature levels. However, u sing the \nobtained login credentials, cyber actors  successfully in troduced malware into the \ncorporations  point of sale systems , stealing  information for approximately 40 million \ndebit and credit cards. While the  HVAC company required access to the retail \ncorporations  network to carry out its responsibilities, findings suggest  the corporation  \nlikely would  have been able to mitigate third-party access to their payment system s by \nimplementing network seg mentation a nd access control . [2] \nTraditional network security has emphasized  a defense -in-depth approach ; however , \nmost networks invest primarily i n perimeter defense. Once inside the network perimeter, \nend users, applications, and other entities are often given broad access to multiple \ncorporate resources. If network users or components are compromised, malicious \nactors can gain access to critical r esources from inside or outside the network . Ideally, \norganizations should manage, monitor, and restrict both internal and external traffic \nflows.  \nThis cybersecurity information sheet (CSI) will discuss  the network and environment \npillars focus  on impleme nting security controls close to resources and data in addition \nto perimeter defense , pursuant to the Zero Trust ( ZT) security model . This pillar s \nprimary areas  include mapping data flows within the network and implementing network \nsegmentation with strong access controls  to inhibit lateral movement . This shift enable s \nhost isolation, network segmentation, enforcement of encryption, and enterprise \nvisibility . As organizations mature their internal network control , they greatly  improve \ntheir defense -in-depth posture  and, consequently,  can isolate  network intrusions to a \nsmall portion of the network . \nAudience  \nThis CSI provides guidance primarily intended for N ational Security Systems  (NSS) , the \nDepartment of Defense ( DoD), and the Defense Industrial Base ( DIB). However , it may \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  3 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nbe useful for owners and operators of other systems that might be targeted by \nsophisticated malicious actors. This CSI incorporates guidance from the DoDs  Zero \nTrust Strategy, Zero Trust Reference Architecture , and Cybersecurity Reference \nArchitecture  (CSRA) . [3], [4], [5] Additional guidance  for other system owners and \noperators is also available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n(NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrast ructure Security Agency (CISA ). [6], [7] \nBackground  \nThe Presidents Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity (EO 14028 ) \nand National Security Memorandum 8 (NSM -8) direct the Federal Civilian Executive \nBranch agencies and NSS owners and operators to develop and implement plans to \nadopt a ZT cybersecurity framework . [8], [9] \nThe NSA CSI, Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model , defines the concept of ZT as a \nsecurity strategy with core principles : acknowledge ment of  the ubiquity of cyber threats , \nand eliminat ion of  implicit trust  favoring  instead continuous verification of all aspects of \nthe operational environment . ZT implementation efforts are intended to continually \nmature cybersecurity protections, responses, and operations over time. Progression of \ncapabilities in each of the seven pi llars of ZT  User, Device, Network & Environment , \nData,  Application & Workload, Automation & Orchestration , and Visibility & Analytics   \nshould be seen as elements in a cycle of continuous improvement based on evalua tion \nand monitoring of threats . [10] \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  4 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \n \nFigure 1: Description of the seven pillars  of Zero Trust  \nFigure 1 depicts the ZT pillars, including the network and environment pillar. The \ncapabilities and milestones for the network and environment pillar component of the ZT \nmaturity model are described in detail throughout this CSI. The pillars are not \nindependent; many capabilities in the network and environment pi llar depend on, or \nalign with , capabilities in other pillars as indicated.  \nNetwork and environment pillar \nWhile a network is the connectivity of hardware and software, the cybersecurity \nenvironment as defined in the DoD CSRA and NIST SP 800-207 is the digi tal \necosystem encompassing  all of the network components, non-person entities , and \nprotocols for inter -communication.  [5], [6] The ZT maturity model delivers a network \nsecured  in-depth through  several key functions of ea ch of the four networking and \nenvironment pillar capabilities : \n Data flow mapping  \n Macro segmentation  \n Micro segmentation  \n Software Defined Networking  \n\n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  5 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nThe network and environment serve this model through a segmented robust \narchitecture that must be intentionally developed at the outset and maintained and \nimproved upon throughout the environments lifecycle.  \nIn addition to a secure network segmentation framework, ZT architecture employs \nsecure network traffic management through strong encrypt ion and persistent verification \nof all users, devices, and data. Automation and orchestration  depends  on defined \nprocesses and security policies, along with adaptive network capabilities to dynamically \nisolate or modify network segmentation as needed. I ntuitive analytics  monitor network \nand other events and  activities  for suspicious  behaviors . Given proper application, t hese \ncapabilities  all support the ZT architecture and have the potential to greatly improve  the \nnetwork s security . \nThe network and environ ment pillar isolates critical resources from unauthorized access \nby defining network access, controlling network and data flows, segmenting applications \nand workloads, and using end -to-end encryption . This is accomplished through proper \nnetwork segmentatio n at the macro and micro level s, combined with software defined \nnetworking (SDN ), to allow centralized control and automation. This pillar depends on \nan organizations depth of awareness and understanding of their data  how it flows  \nwithin standalone networks and across networks  that interconnect physical \ninfrastructure, cloud computing, and distributed work environments .  \n \nFigure 2: Zero Trust network and environment  pillar maturity  \n\n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  6 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nData flow mapping  \nData flow mapping identifies the route data travels within an organization and describes \nhow that data transforms from one location or application to another. This activity \nhighlights the internal and external nodes on which data is stored or processed, which \nenabl es the discovery of any data misuse. Organizations should leverage data owners \nand network teams knowledge to form a comprehensive data flow map.  \nThis map can also identify data flows where the data is not properly encrypted. In cases \nwhere dat a is not encrypted in transit, the data senders should enable end -to-end \nencryption where possible or leverage virtual private networks (VPNs)  or equivalent \nencrypted tunnels and protocols  to protect the data in transit.  \nIn addition to discovering flows where data is insufficiently protected, t his data flow \nmapping process is foundation al for other network activities, such as macro and micro  \nsegmentation. Further, u nderstanding how data flows through the network aids in \nefficiently identifying anoma lous traffic behavior  via analytics . \nTable 1: Data flow mapping maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nIdentify \nlocations where \ndata is stored \nand processed \nand in which \nstate the data \ncomponents \nare stored.  Organizations  begin \nthe mapping of both \nphysical and logical \ndata flows . Mapping \nis primarily manual at \nthis level.   \n \nUnencrypted data \nflows are transitioned \nto encrypted data \nflows or within \nencrypted network \ntunnels  or protocols . Organizations have a \ncomplete list of  \napplications and have \nidentified critical data \nflows .  \n \nSome automation has \nbeen implemented to \nmaintain the accuracy of \nmappings. Any \nanomalous data flows \nidentified should be \nisolated or eliminated at \nthis level.   \n Organizations \nhave a \ncomplete \ninventor y of \ndata flows.  \n \nAutomation \nmonitors for \ncontrols, and \nmitigates all \ncurrent, new, or \nanomalous data \nflows.  \nMacro  segmentation  \nNetwork segmentation is crucial in designing and implementing a ZT architecture. It can \nbe broken down as follows:  \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  7 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \n Macro segmentation  \n Micro segmentation  \nMacro segmentation  provides high -level control over traffic moving between various \nareas of an organizations network by breaking up a network into multiple discrete \ncomponents  with each supporting a different security requi rement . In other  words, \nmacro segmentation can be thought of as the  separation of sub-organizations within a \ncompany . For example, an employee in the IT department should  not have access to \nthe accounting department s section of the network, and all of the  data and resources \nresiding there . These  network boundaries , coupled with access controls , provide \nsecurity by shrinking the attack surface to prevent lateral movement. Additionally, macro \nsegmentation  paves the way for automating security  responses . As a  result, this further \nminimizes the risks of loss from data breaches, denial of service , or malware \nproliferation.  \nIn the case of the retail corporations  data breach  detailed earlier , an HVAC company \nwas given  valid access to the network  for service -related tasks . The network was not \nproperly segmented however,  allowing a  cyber actor  to access the network using  \ncredentials stolen from some of the  HVAC company  employees and  pivot to point -of-\nsales  systems.  [1] According to public reporting, macro  segmentation could have \nprevented this, saving millions of dollars in customer and corporate losses . [2] \nTable 2: Macro segmentation maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nDefine different \nsecurity levels \non the network.  \nMap the logical \ndistinctions in \nnetwork \nstructure.  \n Organizations begin \nsegmenting their \nnetworks based on \nbusiness functions , \nlocations , and asset \ncriticality .  \nUse of internal  \nsecurity controls are \nstrengthen ed within \nany existing \nsegments (e.g. \nVLANS)  Access policies \nrestricting lateral \nmovement between \nsegments are \ndefined and written \ninto firewall rules  \nbased on security \npolicies .  The n etwork is \nfurther  segment ed \ninto more granular \ncomponents and an \nautomated central \nmanagement system \nis integrated and \nconfigured to \nmanage the growth \nof the network.  \n \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  8 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nMicro segmentation  \nMicro segmentation  provides security at a granular level by breaking down a  portion of \nthe network into smaller components to limit how data flows  laterally through strict \naccess policies. Micro  segmentation can be thought of as the network se paration within \na sub-organization; employees in the same department should not have access to each \nothers resources  unless explicitly required . This provides  for additional security \nenforcement  closer to applications and resources , augmenting policies already \nestablished at  the network perimeter. Therefore, m icro segmentation  involves isolating \nusers, applications, or workflows into individual network segments to further reduce the \nattack surface and limit the impact should a breach occur .  \nWhile the  intrusion into  the retail corporations  network  occurred ten years ago, the \nlessons learned continue to reverberate  throughout the cybersecurity industry. For \nexample, because micro segmenting the point -of-sales systems from each other and \nfrom other systems  might have limited the impact , micro segmentation  is now a primary \ncomponent of many organizations defense posture . Todays  SDN technology makes \nthis more manageable through central control and automated policy enforcement.  \nTable 3: Micro segmentation maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nDefine \ndifferent \nsecurity levels \non the \nnetwork  \nbased on \nidentity and \napplication \naccess . Organizations \nbegin to \ntransition toward \nservice -specific \ninterconnections \nand the isolation \nof critical data \nflows.  Organizations \ndeploy endpoint \nand application \nisolation \nmechanisms to \nmore of their \nnetwork \narchitecture with \ningress/egress \ncontrols  between \nmicro segments . \nControls are tested \nand refined as \nneeded.  Organizations employ \nextensive micro \nsegmentation  based on \napplication profiles and data \nflows , with continuous \nauthentication of \nconnectivity for service -\nspecific interconnections.  \n \nCentral management \nplatforms are refined to \nprovide  automated  and \noptimal visibility  and \nsecurity monit oring, \nincluding alerting on \nanomalous behavior.  \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  9 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nSoftware defined networking  \nSDN offers unique advantages in terms of granularity through micro segmentation, \nadaptability, and centralized policy management. Integrating SDN components into \nexisting infrastructure also can enable customizable security monitoring and alerting.  \nThough  micro  segmentation can be achieved with traditional system components  and \nmanual configuration , the centralized nature of SDN allows for dynamic implementation \nand management across the network. SDN enables the control of packet routing by a \ncentralized control server via a distributed forwarding plane, provides additional visibility \ninto the network, and enables unified policy enforcement.  \nSDN is already a feature of many modern network devices currently in use and can \nallow flexible integration and cont rol of new equipment. Additionally, SDN network \nmanagement platforms are readily available and can automate manual tasks. This \nfacilitates integration of network segments under a common centrally  managed policy \nand reduces the risk of human error , such as misconfigurations as the network scales.  \nWhile security of the network overall benefits from micro  segmentation through SDN, \nthe SDN Controller (SDNC) itself can become a priority target that requires proper \nconfiguration and continuous monitoring. As scripts are written to make application \nprogramming interface  (API) calls to facilitate necessary automation  of tasks , SDNC \nconfigurations can expose those APIs.  SDN improves  network security by automating \nupdates and security policies . However,  to prev ent exposing APIs, good cybersecurity \npractices (and discipline) are necessary to inhibit the  unauthorized disabling of security \ncontrols  and other compromises of SDN capabilities . Refer to Managing Risk from \nSoftware Defined Networking Controllers  for more information about these risks and \nrecommended practices . [11]  \nDedicated API administrator roles should be created with restricted privileges that do \nnot allow the same level of access as SDN administrators. The SDNC should only \naccept A PI calls from authorized API administrators. API calls should be secured using \nproper encrypted protocols (e.g.,  TLS v1.2 or newer , SSH v2 or newer ) and mutual \nauthentication (such as client and server certificates ) when possible to protect the data \nin tra nsit.  \n  \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  10 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \nTable 4: Software defined networking maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganizations \nmap network \nsegments \nwithin their \nadministrative \npurview and \nidentify a \nroadmap for \nSDN \ncomponent \nintegrations.  Integrate SDN \ncomponents and \ndevelop a central \ncontrol plane, along \nwith management \npolicy, network \nconfiguration rules, \nand task schedule \n(such as updates).  \n \nMap SDN APIs , \nestablish roles, and \nconfigure the  SDNC to \nmake API calls using \nencryption and \nauthentication . Test \ninterconnectedness \nand set \nconfigurations to \nemploy \nsegmentation rules \nat the optimal level  \nof granularity .  \n \nCreate alert systems \nto notify \nadmin istrator s of \nanomalous or \nsuspicious behavior.  Employ advanced \nanalytics and \ncontrols.  \n \nTest the netwo rk to \ndetermine which \nnetwork paths would \nallow an intruder to \nmove between \nsegments laterally or \notherwise.  \n \nRestrict the paths as \nappropriate with strict \naccess controls .  \nSummary  \nExpanding and refining the network and environment pillar  roadmap according to the  \nmaturity model developed here provide s an organization with processes for resisting, \ndetecting, and responding to threats that exploit weaknesses or gaps in their enterprise \narchitecture. Those  processes support an operational mindset in which it is assumed \nthat threats  already  exist within the nominal boundaries of their systems. Vigilance is \nrequired to ensure that risks are continually assessed, and appropriate responses are \nenacted in a timely manner, with follow -up investigati ons and damage control as \nnecessary.  \nNSA strongly recommends that network owners and operators strengthen their network \nand environment by developing capabilities commensurate with the advanced levels of  \nmaturity models described in this CSI. Network and environment security begins with \nestablishing an accurate inventory of al l current data flows . This  ensur es that access to \nthese flows is properly protected , vetted , and appropriate .  \nTo mature the network and environment capabilities, an organization should:  \n Map data flows based on usage patterns and operational business requirements .  \n Properly segment the network at both the macro and micro level s.  \n For centralized control and automated tasking, use  SDN where it is available and \npractical to do so.  \n\n  \nU/OO/125052 -24 | PP-24-0689 | MAR  2024 Ver. 1.0  11 NSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturit y Throughout the Network and Environment  Pillar  \n Automate  security policies  to gain operational efficiency and agility .  \n Use risk -based methodologies to define access rules that include mechanisms to \nensure malicious or unauthorized traffic is dropped prior to reaching network \nresources  at the perimeter, macro, and micro boundaries .  \nFurther guidance  \nNSA is actively assisting DoD customers in piloting ZT systems, coordinating activities \nwith existing NSS and DoD programs, and developing additional ZT guidance to support \nsystem developers through the challe nges of integrating ZT within NSS, DoD, and DIB \nenvironments. Upcoming guidance will help organize, guide, and simplify incorporation \nof ZT  principles and designs into enterprise networks.  \nWorks cited  \n[1] Computerworld.
