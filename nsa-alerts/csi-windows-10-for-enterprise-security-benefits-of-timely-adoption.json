The functionality of many of \nthese features has been evaluated  through  the \nNational Information Assuran ce Partnership \n(NIAP)[1]. \nSemi -Annual over Long -Term \nServicing  \nMicrosoft\n0F1 provides two servicing options for \nWindows 10 Enterprise clients[2]. \n The Semi -Annual Channel (SAC) option \nincludes new or updated features that Microsoft \ndeems ready for broad deployment in each \nrelease. With two releases each  year, SAC is \nideal for most  users that require the latest \nfeatures immediately. NSA recommends SAC \nfor wide adoption on desktop, office automation, \nand enterprise systems.  \n The Long -Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)  \noption is Microsofts model of releasing a major \nversion of Windows every two to three years. \nSystems using LTSC will receive critical security \nupdates in between releases, but will not receive \nnew security features, architectural security \nfixes, or feature enhancements until the next OS \nrelease. The LTSC release is not recommended \n                                                \n1 Windows, Microsoft, and Hyper -V are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corp.  \n \n \n for desktop systems due to the disadvantages of \nnot receiving new sec urity features and \narchitectural fixes.  \nHistorically, each iteration of security updates in the \nSAC has included a notable increase in the use of \nControl Flow Guard in the compilation of system \nfiles, hardening the system against arbitrary code \nexecution.  \nSAC releases include major updates to the \nCredential Guard feature. Windows 10 version 1511 \nintroduced Credential Manager support, and version \n1607 includes Virtual Secure Mode and Hyper -V1 \nenabled by default. LTSC maintains an older base \nversion of Crede ntial Guard from mid -2015.  \nWindows Defender Exploit Guard provides many \nthreat mitigations and improvements to reduce the \nattack surface of applications by replacing the \ndeprecated Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit \n(EMET). Microsoft introduced Exploit  Guard with \nWindows 10 version 1709. LTSC does not yet \ninclude Exploit Guard.  \nWhen 46 public User Account Control (UAC) bypass \ntechniques[3] were tested by NSA on two recent \nversions of Windows, the results showed a 80.43% \nbypass success rate in Windows 10  version 1507 \n(LTSC), with only a 36.96% success rate in 1709 \n(SAC). Using SAC for timely adoption of releases \nmitigates most additional techniques that are not \nexplicitly patched in Microsoft security updates.  \nNew major features are added with each SAC \nrelease, as well as a number of minor security \nfeatures. Recent examples include:  \n Windows Information Protection (WIP) provides \na barrier between personal and enterprise data \nto prevent data leakage.  \n Windows 10 for Enterprises Security Benefits of Timely \nAdoption  \n[1] NIAP Certification of Windows 10 [Online].

DEP allows \nWindows to mark areas of memory as non -\nexecutable (NX) to help mitigate code injection \nand buffer overflow attacks.  \nEnterprise over Professional  \nThe Enterprise edition of Window s provides \nadvanced capabilities to protect against modern \nsecurity threats. Many NSA -recommended \nmitigations require security features that are \npresent only in the Enterprise edition of Windows.  \n AppLocker\n1F2 provides application whitelisting, \nwhich allows for greater administrative control \nover application execution policy. AppLocker \nenables logging of application executables, \n                                                \n2 AppLocker and Microsoft Edge are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corp.  \n provides visibility into application inventory, and \nprevents the execution of common malware.  \n Virtual Secure Mode (VSM)  uses Microsofts \nhypervisor (Hyper -V) to isolate critical system \nservices: Kernel Mode Code Integrity (KMCI), \nHypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI), a nd the Local \nSecurity Authority Subsystem Service \n(LSASS)[4]. Because the VSM virtual machine is \nseparate from the host operating system (OS), \nmalware cannot tamper with the service or \nmodify its data.  \n Credential Guard  places an isolated version of \nLSASS i n VSM providing a mitigation for some \nforms of Pass -the-Hash attacks.  \n Windows Defender Application Guard uses \nHyper -V to isolate the Microsoft Edge1[5] web \nbrowser from the host while the user browses \nuntrusted sites.  \n Device Guard  prevents untrusted code from \nexecuting by ensuring that only trusted, signed \ncode runs after the boot loader. Device Guard \nmoves code integrity mechanisms into VSM, and \nenforces signing for boot binaries and firmware.  \nWindows 10 Enterprise 64 -bit Semi -\nAnnual Channel  \nMicrosoft introduced their newest update strategy, \nWindows as a Service, in Windows 10. With this \nnew approach, Microsoft has increased the pace of \nincorporating security improvements into the OS.  \nThe 64-bit version of Window 10 Enterprise Semi -\nAnnual Channel levera ges the largest set of \nsecurity features and improvements offered by \nMicrosoft, making it NSAs recommendation for \ninstallation on National Security Systems.  \nDisclaimer of Warranties and Endorsement  \nThe information and opinions contained in this document a re provided \"as is\" and \nwithout any warranties or guarantees.
