In 2022, malicious cyber actors exploited older software vulnerabilities more \nfrequently than recently disclosed vulnerabilities  and target ed unpatched , internet -facing systems.  \n\n \n \n  Page 2 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23 -215A  UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nTLP: CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR  The authoring agencies strongl y encourage vendors, designers, developers, and end -user \norganizations to implement the recommendations found within the Mitigations  section of this \nadvisory including the following to reduce the risk of compromise by mal icious cyber act ors. \n Vendors, designers, and developers : Implement secure -by-design and -default principle s \nand tactic s to reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities in your software . \no Follow the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) , also known as SP \n800-218, and implement secure design practices into each stage of the software \ndevelop ment life cycle (SDLC).  As part of this, establish a coordinated vulnerability \ndisclosure program  that includes processes to determine root causes of discovered \nvulnerabilities.  \no Prioritize secure -by-default configurations , such as eliminating default passw ords, \nor requiring addition configuration changes to enhance product security . \no Ensure that published CVEs include the proper CWE  field identifying  the root \ncause of the vulnerability . \n End-user organizations : \no Apply timely patches to systems . Note:  First che ck for signs of compromise if CVEs \nidentified in this CSA have not been patched.  \no Implement a centralized patch management system . \no Use security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) , web \napplication  firewalls, and network protocol analyze rs. \no Ask yo ur software providers to discuss their secure by design program  and to \nprovide links to information about how they are working to remove classes of \nvulnerabilities and to set secure default settings.   \nTECHNICAL DETAILS  \nKey Findings  \nIn 2022, malicious  cyber actors exploited older  software vulnerabilities  more frequently  than recently \ndisclosed vulnerabilities and target ed unpatched , internet -facing systems. Proof of concept (PoC) \ncode was publicly available f or many of the  software vulnerabilities or v ulnerability chains, likely \nfacilitating exploitation by a broader range of malicious  cyber  actors.  \nMalicious cyber actors generally have the most success exploiting known vulnerabilities within the \nfirst two years of public disclosure the value of such vu lnerabilities gradually decreases as software \nis patched or upgraded. Timely patching  reduces the effectiveness  of known , exploitable  \nvulnerabilities , possibly decreasing the pace of malicious cyber actor operations and forcing pursu it of \nmore costly and t ime-consuming methods  (such as developing zero -day exploits or conducting \nsoftware supply chain operations ). \nMalicious  cyber  actors likely  prioritize developing  exploits for severe and  globally prevalent CVEs . \nWhile sophisticated actors also develop tools to exploit other vulnerabilities, developing exploits for \ncritical, wide -spread, and publicly known vulnerabilities gives actors low -cost, high -impact tools they \n\n \n \n  Page 3 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23 -215A  UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nTLP: CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR  can use for several years. Additionally,  cyber actors likely give higher priority to vulnerabi lities that are \nmore prevalent in their specific targets networks. Multiple  CVE or CVE chains require the actor to \nsend a malicious web request to the vulnerable device, which often includes unique signatures that \ncan be detected through deep packet inspe ction.  \nTop Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities  \nTable 1 shows the top  12 vulnerabilities  the co -authors  observed malicious cyber actors routinely \nexploiting  in 202 2: \n CVE-2018 -13379 . This vulnerability, affecting Fortinet SSL VPNs , was also routinely \nexploited in 2020  and 2021 . The continued  exploitation  indicates  that many organizations \nfailed to patch software in a timely manner and remain vulnerable to malicious cyber \nactors.  \n CVE-2021 -34473 , CVE-2021 -31207 , CVE-2021 -34523 . These vulnerabilities, known as \nProxyShell, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. In combin ation, successful \nexploitation enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code. These vulnerabilities  reside  \nwithin  the Microsoft  Client  Access  Service  (CAS),  which  typically  runs on port 443 in \nMicrosoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g., Microso fts web server). CAS is \ncommonly exposed to the internet to enable users to access their email via mobile devices \nand web browsers.  \n CVE-2021 -40539 . This vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote code execution \n(RCE) in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and was linked to the usage of an \noutdated third -party dependency. Initial exploitation of this vulnerability began in late 2021  \nand continued throughout 2022 . \n CVE-2021 -26084 . This vulnerability,  affecting  Atlassian  Confluence  Server  and Data  \nCenter  (a web -based collaboration tool used by governments and private companies)  \ncould  enable  an unauthenticated  cyber actor  to execute  arbitrary  code  on vulnerable  \nsystems.  This vu lnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited \nvulnerabilities after a  PoC was released  within  a week  of its disclosure.  Attempted  mass  \nexploitation  of this vulnerability was observed in September 2021.  \n CVE-2021 - 44228 . This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apaches Log4j library, \nan open -source logging framework incorporated into thousands of products worldwide. An \nactor can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable \nsystem , caus ing the execution of arbitrary code.  The request  allows  a cyber  actor  to take \nfull control  of a system.  The actor  can then steal information, launch ransomware, or \nconduct other malicious activity. [1] Malicious  cyber actors began exploiting the \nvulnerability after it was publicly disclosed in December 2021, and continued to show high \ninterest in CVE-2021 - 44228  through the first half of 2022.  \n CVE-2022 -22954 , CVE-2022 -22960 . These vulnerabilities allow RCE , privilege escalation, \nand authen tication bypass in VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and \nother VMware products. A malicious  cyber  actor with network access could trigger a \nserver -side template injection that may result in remote code execution . Exploitation of \n\n \n \n  Page 4 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23 -215A  UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nTLP: CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR  CVE-2022 -22954  and CVE-2022 -22960  began in early 2022  and attempts continued \nthroughout the remainder of the year.  \n CVE-2022 -1388 . This vulnerability allows unauthenticated malicious  cyber  actors to \nbypass iControl REST authentication  on F5 BIG -IP application delivery and security \nsoftware . \n CVE-2022 -30190 . This vul nerability impacts the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool \n(MSDT) in Windows. A remote, unauthenticated cyber actor could exploit this vulnerability \nto take control of an affected system.  \n CVE-2022-26134 . This critical RCE vulnerability affects Atlassian Confluence and Data \nCenter. The vulnerability, which was likely initially exploited as a zero -day before public \ndisclosure in June  2022 , is related to an older Confluence vulnerability ( CVE-2021 -26084 ), \nwhich cyber actors also exploited in 2022.  \nTable 1: Top 12 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities  in 2022 \nCVE Vendor  Product  Type  CWE  \nCVE-2018 -\n13379  Fortinet  FortiOS and FortiProxy  SSL VPN

CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR  MITIGATIONS  \nVendors and Developers  \nThe authoring agencies  recommend vendors  and developers  take the following steps  to ensure their \nproducts are secure by des ign and default : \n Identify repeatedly exploited classes of vulnerability. Perform an analysis of both CVEs \nand known exploited vulnerabilities  to understand which classes of vulnerability are identified \nmore than others. Implement appropriate mitigations to  eliminate those classes of \nvulnerability. For example, if a product has several instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities, \nensure all database queries in the product use parameterized queries, and prohibit other \nforms of queries.  \n Ensure business leaders  are responsible for security. Business leaders should ensure \nthat proactive steps to eliminate entire classes of security vulnerabilities, rather than only \nmaking one -off patches when new vulnerabilities are discovered.  \n Follow the SSDF (SP 800 -218) and implement secure design practices into each stage of the \nSDLC.  Pay attention to:  \no Prioritiz ing the use of memory safe languages wherever possible [ SSDF PW 6.1 ]. \no Exercis ing due diligence when selecting software components (e.g., software libraries, \nmodules, middleware, frameworks)  to ensure robust security in consumer software \nproducts  [SSDF PW 4.1 ]. \no Setting up secure development team practices ; this includes c onducting peer code \nreviews , work ing to a common organization secure coding standard, and maintainin g \nawareness of language specific security concerns  [SSDF  PW.5.1,  PW.7.1, PW.7.2 ]. \no Establishing a vulnerability disclosure program  to verify and resolve security \nvulnerabilities disclosed by people who may be internal or external to the organization \n[SSDF RV.1.3 ]. As part of this, establish processes to determine root causes of \ndiscovered vulnerabilities.  \no Using static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools to analyze \nproduct source code and application behavior to detect error -prone practices [SSDF \nPW.7.2, PW.8.2 ]. \no Configur ing production -ready product s to have to mo st secure settings as default and \nprovi ding guidance on the risks of changing each setting [ SSDF PW.9.1, PW9.2 ] \n Prioritize secure -by-default configurations  such as el iminating default passwords, \nimplementing single sign on (SSO) technology via modern open standards, and providing \nhigh-quality audit logs to customers with no additional configuration and at no extra charge.  \n Ensure published CVEs include the proper  CWE  field identifying the root cause of the \nvulnerability  to enable industry -wide analysis of software security and design flaws . \nFor more information on designing secure -by-design and -default products , includ ing additional \nrecommended  secure -by-default configu rations,  see joint guide Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity \nRisk: Principles and Approaches for Security -by-Design and -Default . \n\n \n \n  Page 10 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23 -215A  UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nTLP: CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR  End-User Organizations  \nThe autho ring agencies recommend end -user organizations implement the mitigations below to \nimprove cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actors activity. These mitigations align with \nthe cross -sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by C ISA and the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and \nprotections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the \nCPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and g uidance to protect against the most common and \nimpactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISAs Cross -Sector Cybersecurity \nPerformance Goals  for more i nformation on CPGs, including additional recommended baseline \nprotections.  \nVulnerability and Configuration Management  \n Update software, operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets in \na timely manner  [CPG 1.E ]. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities , especially \nthose CVEs identified in this CSA, then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote \ncode execution or denial -of-service on internet -facing equipment. For patch information on \nCVEs identified in this CSA, refer to the appendix . \no If a patch for a known  exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied, \nimplement vendor -approved workarounds.  \no Replace end -of-life software (i.e., software no longer supported by the vendor ). \n Routinely perform automated asset discovery  across the entire estate to identify and \ncatalogue all the systems, services, hardware and software.  \n Implement a robust patch management process and centralized patch management \nsystem that establishes prioritization of patch applications  [CPG 1.A ]. \no Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning  and patching of internet -facing \nsystems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service \nproviders ( CSPs) or other managed  service providers ( MSPs). Reputable MSPs can \npatch applications such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other \nemployee collaboration tools for their customers. However, MSPs and CSPs can \nexpand the ir custom ers attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, so \norganizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly \nreduce risk  [CPG  1.F].

Store copies off -networ k in physically secure \nlocations and test regularly  [CPG 2.R ]. \n Maintain an updated cybersecurity incident response plan  that is tested at least annually \nand u pdated within a risk informed time frame to ensure its effectiveness  [CPG 2.S ]. \nIdentity and Access Management  \n Enforce phishing -resistant  multifactor authenti cation (MFA) for all users , without \nexception.  [CPG 2.H ]. \n Enforce  MFA on all VPN connections . If MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in \nremote work  to use strong passwords  [CPG 2.A, 2.B , 2.C , 2.D, 2.G ]. \n Regularly review, validate, or remove privileged accounts  (annually at a minimum)  [CPG \n2.D, 2.E]. \n Configure access control under the principle of least privilege  [CPG 2.Q ]. \no Ensure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least privilege) \nto perform intended function s (using non-administrative privileges  where feasible ). \nNote:  See CISA s Capacity Enhancement Guide  Implementing Strong Authentication  \nand ACSC s guidance on Implementing Multi -Factor Authentication  for more \ninformation on authentication system  hardening . \nProtective Controls and Architecture  \n Properly configure and  secure internet -facing network devices , disable unused or \nunnecessary network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused network \nservices and devices  [CPG 2.V, 2.W, 2X ]. \no Harden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link -Local Multicast \nName Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Common Internet \nFile System (CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP . \no Manage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts ( e.g., KRBTGT) to minimize \nGold en Ticket attacks and Kerbero asting . \no Strictly control the use of native scripting applications , such as  command -line, PowerShell, \nWinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation ( WMI), and Distributed Component Object \nModel  (DCOM ). \n Implement Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA)  to limit or block lateral movement by \ncontrolling access to applications, devices, and databases. Use private virtual local area \nnetworks [CPG 2.F, 2.X ]. Note:  See the Department of Defenses Zero Trust Reference \nArchitecture  for additional information on Zero Trust.  \n\n \n \n  Page 12 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23 -215A  UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFI  \nTLP: CLEAR  \nTLP: CLEAR   Continuously monitor the attack surface  and investigate abnormal activity that may \nindicate cyber  actor or malware lateral movement [CPG 2. T]. \no Use security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security \ninformation and event management (SIEM) tools.  Consider using an information \ntechnology  asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure EDR, SI EM, vulnerability \nscanner , and other similar tools  are reporting  the same number of assets  [CPG 2.T, 2.V ]. \no Use web application firewalls to monitor and filter  web traffic.
