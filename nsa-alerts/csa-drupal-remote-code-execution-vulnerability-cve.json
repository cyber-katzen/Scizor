Use Body Text for most text in  the template. This style has built in spacing.  \nOn March 28, 2018, the Drupal project announced that a vulnerability had been discovered in Drupal 7.x and 8.5.x (as \nwell as prior, unsu pported versions) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on Drupal \ninstallations. In some situations, Drupal installations not directly connected to the Internet could be vulnerable to \nexploitation through a Cross -Site Reques t Forgery (CSRF) attack.  \nWeb-based applications, such as Drupal, can be overlooked in routine patching since vulnerability scans may be unaware \nof their presence. Furthermore, administrators often postpone major version updates to web applications due to t he \nfrequent user impact and incompatibility with customized features. Web applications are a frequent target for attackers \nand vulnerabilities can be exploited days or even hours after their release. In general, configuring web applications to \nupdate autom atically whenever possible is imperative for security.  \nThere are many web -based CMSs similar to Drupal. Other common CMSs include Wordpress4 and Joomla5. \nOrganizations should be aware of CMS installations within their purview and ensure adequate processe s are in place for \ntimely updates.  \nMITIGATION ACTIONS:  \nSystem owners are advised to update to the latest version of Drupal, 8.5.1, which is not impacted by CVE6-2018 -7600. \nThe Drupal project currently supports two major releases, Drupal 7 and Drupal 8.5. In stallations of Drupal 7 should \nupgrade to 7.58. Other unsupported, outdated releases are not secure and should be immediately upgraded to Drupal \n8.5.1. Compromised Drupal installations should be restored to a known good state before updating. Admin istrators should \nrefer to the Drupal security advisory, SA -CORE -2018 -002, for more information.  \nIn addition, consideration should be given to implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if one is not currently in \nplace. The  core WAF ruleset may block most  attempts to exploit this Drupal vulnerability. In general, WAFs provide \nsignificant benefits to web application security and should be implemented in most environments.  \nAPPLICABILITY:   \nThis Bulletin is issued under the authority defined in National Securi ty Directive 42 and applies to all Executive  \nDepartments and Agencies, and to all U.S. Government contractors and agents who operate or use National  \nSecurity Systems (NSS) as defined in CNSS 4009.    \n                                                \n1 Drupal is a registered trademark of Dries Buytaert  \n2 Apache is a registered trademark of the Apache Software Foundation  \n3 Nginx is a registered trademark of Nginx Software Inc.  \n4 Wordpres s is a registerd trademark of the Wordpress Foundation  \n5 Joomla is a registered trademark of Open Source Matters, Inc.  \n6 CVE is a r egistered trademark of The MITRE  Corporation  \n\n \n \n2 U/OO/144343 -18          PP -18-0299          19 April 2018  \n  \nDISCLAIMER OF WARRAN TIES AND ENDORSEMENT : \nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.  \nReference herein to any specific commercial prod ucts, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or \notherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government, \nand this guidance shall not be used for advertising or product endors ement purposes.   \n \nFor further information about this product, please contact:  \nClient Requirements or General Cybersecurity  Inquiries  \nCybersecurity Requirements Center  \n410-854-4200  \nEmail: Cybersecurity_Requests @nsa.gov  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n",
