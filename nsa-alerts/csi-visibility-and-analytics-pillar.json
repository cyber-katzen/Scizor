The constant risk of intrusion underscores the critical \nimportance of swift detection and mitigation.  \nThis cybersecurity information sheet (CSI) centers on the visibility and analytics aspect \nof the Zero Trust ( ZT) mode l, emphasizing the significance of comprehensively \nobserving data characteristics and events within an enterprise -wide environment. \nPrioritizing cyber -related data analysis aids in informing policy decisions, facilitating \nresponse actions, and constructing  a risk profile to proactively fortify security measures.  \nVisibility and analytics form the cornerstone of any ZT strategy, empowering \norganizations to harness infrastructure, tools, data, and techniques for proactively \nmitigating risks and for rapid ident ification, detection, and response  to emerging cyber \nthreats. Evolving from traditional signature -based approaches, detection (visibility  and \nanalytics ) and response capabilities are increasingly adopting behavior -based \nmethodologies to combat the sophisti cation of modern cyber threats. This pillar \nhighlights the benefits of continuous monitoring and provides insights essential for \nidentifying and mitigating potential security risks  to assure that only authorized users \nand devices access sensitive resources . \nThis CSI offers recommendations for advancing visibility and analytics within the ZT \nframework. It explains  how these capabilities seamlessly integrate into a comprehensive \nZT framework as detailed in the NSA publication , Embracing a Zero Trust Security \nModel . [1] National Security System (NSS), Department of Defense ( DoD), and Defense \nIndustrial Base (DIB) stakeholders can leverage this guidance in conjunction wit h \ncomplementary resources to enhance visibility and analytics through the implementation \nof outlined capabilities.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  2 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nIntroduction  \nThe advent of generative artificial in telligence,  capable of mimicking human \ncommunication patterns with remarkable speed, has e xacerbated th e phishing threat. \n[2] To effectively combat phishing , it is crucial to delve into various indicators and \nunderstand the requisite visibility needed t o capture relevant information \ncomprehensively. Once this data is gathered, the fusion across disparate sources \nbecomes imperative to stitch together the attack pattern triggered by the initial phishing \nattempt. Traditional IT architectures often falter in  detecting this threat due to their \ninability to adapt and respond swiftly to the dynamic nature of phishing techniques , \nunderscoring the urgent need for enhanced visibil ity and analytics capabilities.  \nResearchers have learned repeatedly that the actions of malicious cyber actors are \nrarely impulsive and unplanned. These entities often act in intentional and deliberate \nways; a concept captured in the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base focused on the \nspecific taxonomy of adversarial actions . [3] Detecting and identifying potential threats \nrequires both human and technological elements to understand the entirety of the \nnetwork, to detect anomalous changes that may signal intrusion , and to react to an \nincident expediently  and properly should one occur.  \nThe individual concepts in this CSI are not entirely novel , but are presented in a manner \nthat identifies their unique and interdependent roles in supporting cybersecurity thr ough \na complete Z ero Trust (ZT)  framework. They work together to uphold the key principles \nof ZT, while focusing more directly on the visibility and analytics pillar of capabilities and \nactivities as defined in the DoD Zero Trust Strategy.  [4] \nAudience  \nThis CSI provides guidance primarily intende d for N ational Security System (N SS), \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) networks, but may be \nuseful for owners and operators of other systems that might be targeted by \nsophisticated malicious actors. Guidance for system owners and operators is also \navailable via the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  [5] and the \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA ). [6] This guidance is \ncompatib le with the DoDs Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (CSRA) Version 5.0 , \n[7] the DoD Zero Trust Reference Architecture (ZT  RA) Version 2.0, [8] and the DoD \nZero Trust Strategy , [4] referenced at the end of this document . \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  3 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nBackground  \nThe Presidents Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity (EO 14028)  \n[9] and National Security Memorandum 8 (NSM -8) [10] direct the Federal Civilian \nExecutive Branch (FCEB) agencies and NSS owners and operators to develop plans to \nadopt a ZT cybersecurity framework .  \nIn Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model , the concept of ZT is defined and \ncontextualized along with the undergirding principles of the seven pillars. The pillars are \ncomposed  of capabilities that enable progressive maturity across a comprehensive ZT \nframework . [1] The capabilities described in this CSI are intended to continually mature \ncybersecurity protections, responses, and operations over time. Progression of \ncapabilities in each of the seven pillars shou ld be seen as a cycle of continuous \nimprovement based on evaluation and monitoring of threats.   \nThis CSI offers guidance in accordance with the DoD ZT RA maturity scale of \npreparation, baseline, intermediate, and advanced. It also complements the ZT Portfolio \nManagement Office (PfMO) guidance of \"target\" and advanced levels . [4] \n \nFigure 1: Description of the seven pillars of Zero Trust  \n\n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  4 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nFigure 1 displays the seven ZT pillars, including the visibility and analytics pillar. The \ncapabilities and milestones for the visibility and analytics pillar of the ZT maturity model \nwill be described in detail throughout this document. The seven ZT  pillars are not \nindependent as each pillar depends on or aligns with the capabilities in the other pillars.  \nVisibility and analytics pillar  \nAccording to the DoD ZT RA, visibility improves detection of anomalous behavior and \nprovides the ability to make dy namic changes to security policy and real -time access \ndecisions. [8] The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust \nMaturity Model Version 2 .0, which aligns with NSS guidance,  refers to visibility as \nobservable artifacts that result from the characteristics of and events within enterprise -\nwide environments . [6] The visibility and analytics pillar in the ZT framework provides \nhealth, status, performance, behavioral, and threat insights across the infrastructure by \nobserving real -time communications and security -relevant activities happening across \nall network components. This pillar is necessary for baselining data needed for the other \npillars because it leverages log data from all of them to build a comprehensive picture of \nwhat is happening across t he network. Not only does this pillar depend on the other \npillars, but then it employs its own capabilities to bring together and make sense of the \ncollected  data, producing critical insights into anomalous and potentially malicious \nactivity.  \nThis is acco mplished through the following key capabilities  to be discussed in greater \ndetail below :  \n Logging all relevant activity  \n Centralized security information and event  management  \n Security and risk analytics  \n User and entity behavior analytics  \n Threat intelligence in tegration  \n Automated dynamic policies   \nThese capabilities ensure that proper implementation of the visibility and analytics pillar \nwill facilitate analysis of events, activities, and behaviors and feed  artificial intelligence \nand machine learning technology for additional actionable analytics . Success in the \nvisibility and analytics pillar ensures that detection and response to cybersecurity \nthreats is prompt, and allows for threat hunting, forensics, ac celerated investigations, \nand support to compliance initiatives.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  5 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \n \nFigure 2: Zero Trust visibility and analytics  pillar maturity  \nLogging  all relevant activity  \nThe first step in making sense of what is happening on the network is to capture  \nrelevant activity  logs from network devices (e.g., switches, routers, wireless access \npoints, network monitoring software), user devices and applications (e.g., office \nproducts, development tools, operating systems), authentication services (e.g ., \nidentities and credentials used, account directories, federation gateways, etc.), and \nresources and data access (e.g., file systems, hosted services, email services, \nwebsites, etc.) . Given the amount of log data this could entail, capture only pertinent  \nactivities occurring across the environment  with priorit y given to  the right viewpoints \nrather than indiscriminately collecting everything.  Begin by identifying  all available log \nsources and potential log events, and then  choosing the ones to capture that  have \nrelevant, useful information. These logs should  be gathered into a central repository, \nlike a SIEM, and stitched together into a workflow that can be analyzed for indicators of \nsuspicious or malicious activity.  \nTraditionally, this data has been used in isolated computer security or information \ntechnology initiatives (e.g., operations, audits, user behavior, regulatory compliance)  as \nsnapshot activities , such as annual assessments or penetration testing, or as \nsupplementary information sources on an as-needed basis. Collecting and \nunderstanding activities via logs allows for the baselining and determination of what is \n\n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  6 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nconsidered normal activity on the network. Once established, any deviation from the \nnorm can be investigated to determine if an acti vity is benign (such as an accidental \nmisconfiguration) or malicious.  The logs must be collected , stored, standardized per \nindustry standards, and analyzed continuously for network security purposes  to always \nhave a view of what is occurring on the network . \nTable 1: Log ging  all relevant activity  maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganizations collect \nand store all  \npertinent  network, \ndata, application, \ndevice, and user \nlogs.  \n \nA network baseline is \nestablished, and an \nupdate schedule to \nensure snapshots \nare kept current.  Logs are parsed, \nnormalized, and \nshared with the \nappropriate \nnetwork \ndefenders  and \nsecurity \noperations \ncenter (SOC).  Logs relevant to \nhunt and incident \nresponse operations \nare identified and \nprioritize d for \nretention and \nanalysis.  \nAdditional logging is \nprocessed as \nneeded.  Logging activities \nare automated  to \nautomatically \ningest , format, and \nnormalize  relevant \nlogs from new \nsources . This \nprovide s a more \ncomplete picture of \nnetwork activities \nand user behavior  \nand facilitates \nsecurity protections \nautomation at \nscale.  \nCentralized s ecurity information and event management  \nOrganizations should utilize security information and event management (SIEM) \ntechnology to aggregate and centralize security  information about a network, correlate  \nevents from different sensor viewpoints,  and perform analysis on th e data to generate \nalerts about potential cybersecurity threats within a network envi ronment . A SIEM \nmanages this data by providing interactive user dashboards with actionable playbooks, \nfast indexing for search queries, and advanced processing capabilities (e.g., machine \nlearning or high performance computing (HPC) capabilities  to manage events at scale ) \nfor preprocessing and detection of threats. The SIEMs objective is to identify security \nthreats and enable them to be mitigated before they have an opportunity to cause harm \nto an organization.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  7 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nTable 2: Centralized  security information and event management (SIEM) maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nNetwork \ndefenders and  \nsecurity \noperations \ncenters (SOC) \nmonitor, detect, \nand analyze \ndata logged \ninto a SIEM \ntool manually .

Use of machine \nlearning to help \nidentify unknown  \nthreat  behaviors . \n \nUse of high \nperformance \ncomputing (HPC) \ncapabilities for \nprocessing data \nfaster and at scales \nnot previously \nachievable.  \nSecurity and risk analytics  \nOrganizations aim to develop analytics that assess ri sk to their data and infrastructure \nusing information about their configuration s, network assets, and known exploited \nvulnerabilities. The risk picture should leverage information about security capabilities \nimplemented to protect systems  and data as factors that may reduce the initial risk \nassessment . The r isk estimation should also factor in the value and criticality of assets \nin the network , such as important files, critical servers , essential services, or highly \nprivileged users , when determining the potential impact of possible incidents . External \ndata, such as Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), known exploits \n(ExploitDBs), and the Common Vuln erability Scoring System (CVSS), should be utilized \nto enrich dynamic risk  scores as  the threat environment changes . \nTable 3: Security risk analytics maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nData , such as \nvulnerabilities \nfrom CVEs, Known \nvulnerabilities, \nconfiguration  Vulnerability information \nfrom CVEs, known \nexploit ed vulnerability A comprehensive \nrisk assessment \nscoring system is \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  8 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nexploits from \nExploitDB, \netc., are \ncollected and \nused to \ndevelop \nCVSS  \nscores .  information , and \nasset  data are \ncombined to \ndevelop a simple \nrisk assessment.  data, asset information, \nand risk mitigation \nmeasures are analyz ed to \ndevelop locally adjusted \nCVSS scor es and more \ncomprehensive risk \nassessments .  \nInitial i nsider threat risk s \nare evaluated.  applied to  networks , \nincluding information \nabout the sensitivity \nof data and criticality \nof assets and \nservices .  \nAdditional \ninformation regarding \nnew vulnerabilities is \npotentially scraped \nfrom authoritative \nsources to better \ndetermine risk.  \nAn automated risk \nassessment system \nis established.  \nUser and entity behavior analytics  \nUser and e ntity behavior analytics (UEBA) utilize log data to detect abnormal behaviors \noccurring on the network. UEBA usually attempts to correlate across many log sources \nto find unusual behaviors, especially since single or limited log sources are often  \ninsufficient to detect malicious behaviors by cyber actors who try to hide within the noise \nof normal network activities and fluctuations. Behavior analytics were first describ ed in \nthe user pillar with analysis of basic user patterns . UEBA within organiz ations completes \nits expansion here by taking collected data and using traditional and machine learning \n(ML) artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to analyze the enormous set of network \nactivities and pick out aberrations that may indicate malicious acti vity. Initially , AI-based \ndetections are supervised , but using  advanced techniques , such as neural networks, \nUEBA operators may not need to be  part of the learning process. These models , \nhowever , will always be probabilistic; models that cannot be fully explained will need to \nbe backed up with evidence , and human operators will always be necessary for \noperational decision s. \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  9 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nThe objective of UEBA is to identify abnormal and potentiall y dangerous behavior  \nindicative of threats. Identification of insider threats is the key objective in locating \nmalicious insiders or hackers who manipulate compromised insider credentials. These \ninsider threats have the capability to escape  notice by  other  security tools since  they act \nwith legitimate permission s or mimic authorized activity on a network . \nMITREs D3FEND  taxonomy of cybersecurity countermeasures includes an entire \ntechnique category of User Behavior Analysis [ D3-UBA] with a dozen sub -techniques \nfor different methods of identifying anomalous behaviors that could indicate potential \nmalicious activity. [11] \nTable 4: User and entity behavior  analytics maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nUEBA \nbaselining and \nprofiling \nstrategy is \ndesigned.  \nHigh-risk areas \nare identified,  \nand specific \nuse-cases are \nestablished.  Organizations initially \nemploy analytics to \nprofile and baseline \nactivity and \nbehaviors of users \nand entities and to \ncorrelate those \nbaseline s to inform \nanomaly detect ion. Abnormal and \npotentially \ndangerous user and \ndevice behavior  \nthreats  are \nautomatically \nidentified.  Advanced automated \nAI-based analytics \nsupport ing detection \nof anomalous users, \ndevices, and other \nentity  actions and \nadvanced threats  are \ncreated  and used . \nThreat intelligence integration  \nThreat intelligence helps organizations enrich their awareness and develop tools and \ntechniques aimed at  threats or activities by threat actor s. Threat intelligence informat ion \nincludes threat indicators;  tactics , techniques , and procedures (TTPs) ; securit y alerts; \nthreat intelligence reports;  tool configurations , and other sources . Threat intelligence \nhelps organizations prioritize security events and alerts based on severity and \nrelevance, identify potential threats that may have gone previously undetecte d, enhance \nAI/ML model accuracy, and inform decision -making processes for security analysts. \nConsider using indicator sharing services from government or sector sharing initiatives, \nas well cybersecurity a dvisories (CSAs) published by NSA or alerts by othe r \ncybersecurity authorities. Many advisories and alerts include indicators that can be used \nby cybersecurity tools and SIEMs. Additionally, threat information informs network \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  10 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nowners of the latest adversary TTPs and can be aggregated, transformed, analyzed,  or \ninterpreted to help set priorities, including for  logging  and mitigations .  \nTable 5: Threat intelligence integration maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nThe \norganization  \ndefines its  \nthreat \nintelligence \nrequirements,  \nincorporating \ncritical assets, \nknown threats, \nuse of threat \nintelligence \ndata, etc.  Threat Intelligence \nPlatforms (TIPs) are \nimplemented, data is \nnormalized  for \nstandardization and \nmachine -readability.  \nSOCs  gather  threat \nintelligence informa tion \nand streams .

Resultant threat \nintelligence data is \ndirectly integrated into \nother SIEM data to \nenhance automated \ndetection  and response \nefforts . \nAutomated dynamic policies  \nInformed by the other capabilities in the visibility and analytics pillar, organizations \nestablish dynamic policies by utilizing previous rule -based access to teach AI/ML \nalgorithms to make automated access decisions  to various resources . Ongoing \nmonitoring of security posture , risk assessments and scoring, and automated patch \nmanagement are all used in this process . \nOne of the ultimate goals of ZT is to establish dynamic policy automation modeled using \nreal-time security  profiles and have those policies continuously adapt  themselves  based \non the changing threat environment and confidence scores.  The same applies to other \npolicies beyond access control as well , such as patc hing and configuration policies.  \nDepending on the organizations policies and risk tolerance, dynamic policies may \nrequire people to approve policy changes, often  through pre -approved policy options \nthat can be implemented dynamically.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/164512 -24 | PP-24-2134  | May 2024  Ver. 1.0  11 NSA | Advancing Ze ro Trust Maturity Throughout the Visibility and Analytics Pillar  \nTable 6: Automated dynamic policies  maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nExisting policies are \nreviewed  and \ndeterminations made \nregarding which \npolicies are suitable \nfor automation.  \nNew dynamic \npolicies developed as \nneeded to address \nemerging threats.
