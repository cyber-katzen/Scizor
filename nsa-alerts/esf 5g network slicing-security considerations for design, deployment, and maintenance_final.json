\nThe Enduring Security Framework1 established a working panel comprised of government and \nindustry experts and conducted an in -depth review of the fifth -generation technology for \nbroadband cellular networks  standalone network slicing  network architecture . This panel assessed \nthe security,  risks, benefits, design, deployment, operations, and maintenance of a 5G standalone \nnetwork slice  over two papers - Parts 1 and 2.  \nThe working panel  published in Potential Threats to 5G Network Slicing2 which identifies some 5G \nnetwork slicing threat vectors  that pose significant risks to network slicing  and serves as Part 1 . \nThis document is Part 2 of the two -part series  - it focuses on addressing some identified threats to \n5G SA network slicing, and provides industry recogni zed practices  for the design, deployment, \noperation, and maintenance of a hardened 5G standalone  network slice (s). \nFor the purposes of this paper, a network slice is defined as an end -to-end logical network that \nprovides specific network capabilities and c haracteristics for a user . More specifically, it is  a network \narchitecture that allows infrastructure providers to divide their network up into several virtual \nnetworks  to satisfy different 5G use cases with varying quality of service requirements and  was not \nintended to be a security mechanism to isolate different 5G user sets.  \nSince a  mobile  network  operator can create specific virtual networks that cater to different clients \nand use cases , security is a major consideration . In a 5G i nfrastructure this necessitates that the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability triad of each network slice must be ensured.  \nThis document will help foster communication amongst mobile network operators, hardware \nmanufacturers, software developers, non-mobile network operators , systems integrators, and \nnetwork  slice customers in the hopes that it may facilitate increased resiliency and security  \nharden ing within network slicing.  \nIntended Audience  \nIt is not the goal of this document to provide an exhaustive how -to list for the design and operation \nof a network slice; rather, to introduce best practices that can help mitigate threats against a 5G \nnetwork slice. The threat landscape in 5G is dynamic; due to this, advanced monitoring, auditing, \nand other analytical capabilities are required to meet certain levels of network slicing service level \nrequirements over time.  \nIt is assumed the audience has some familiarity with 5G networks and the overall concept of \nnetwork slicing. Readers of this document are expected to augment the information contained here \nwith individual studies on current best practices for designing, de ploying, operating, and \nmaintaining a network slice.  \n \n1 The Enduring Security Framework (ESF) is a cross -sector working group that operates under the auspices of Critical Infrastructure \nPartnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) to address threats and risks to the security and stability of U.S. national security sys tems. It is \ncomprised of experts from the U.S. government as well as representatives from the Information Technology , Communications, and \nthe Defense Industrial Base sectors. The ESF is charged with bringing together representatives from private and public sector s to \nwork on intelligence -driven, shared cybersecurity challenges.  \n2 https://media.defense.gov/2022/Dec/13/2003132073/ -1/-\n1/0/POTENTIAL%20THREATS%20TO%205G%20NETWORK%20SLICING_508C_FINAL.PDF   \n\n6 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Scope  \nThis document contains forward -looking statements that may change or evolve as time passes , as \nthe standardization of the 5G network slicing evolves . Existing 5G implementations do not fully \nrealiz e the breadth of available standard s. Current and future 5G standards do not and are unlikely \nto prescribe exactly how 5G standalone network slicing must or should be implemented. This will \nallow for network slicing to have varying implementations between infrastructure \nproviders/vendors. Further discussion is needed between infrastructure providers and \ncurrent /potential customers . \nWhile most of the 3GPP technical specifications supporting basic Network Slicing have been sorted \nout, the industry is still at  the Minimum Viable Product stage , with Mobile Network Operator s \nlooking to commercialize slicing in their own mobile networks. GSMA is facilitating collaboration \non defining minimum standard slice templates, which will facilitate roaming.  \nAs with most emerging technologies, with increased benefits come increased risks. This paper is \nintended to introduce 5G stakeholders to the benefits associated with network slicing, provide \nguidance in line with industry best practices, and present perceived risk s and management \nstrategies which may address those risks.  \nAs of the time of this writing, the commercial availability of standards -based 5G network slicing \nwithin an operators mobile network only appears to be a reality within one year , possibly \nlonger . Given that 5G roaming is still in the future, the expectation is that 5G network slicing \nacross multiple operators networks  is as well . Work also appears to be progressing  for slicing \nwithin a data network that is, a network external to the mobile network however that still falls \ninto the future category . The same can be said for  any network slicing seamlessly coordinated \nacross mobile networks and data networks.  \n \nNonetheless , network slicing is not principally a security mechanism  and cannot be relied on for \nthat purpose. 5G threats, which are beyond the scope of this paper, continue to apply to network \nslicing.  Network slicing introduces additional security concerns, where the details for many of \nthese are beyond the scope of this pap er and should be discussed with infrastructure \nproviders/vendors , such as:  \n \n Inter -slice communications . \n Authentication/Authorization among network slice managers, instances, and elements . \n Different security protocols and policies between slices . \n Denial of service, especially in one slice that affects other slices . \n Exhaustion of security resources, especially in one slice that affects other slices . \n Side channel attacks across slices . \n User equipment  connection to multiple slices . \n Shared network functions,  compute (hypervisor or container engine), data, and other \nresources  (storage, networking)  across slices . \n Slice separation via physical machines, virtual machines, or Linux containers.  \n Shared management and orchestration systems across slices . \n Shared human administrators across slices.  \n The network slice itself and the network slice identifier transmitted by the user equipment  \nmay represent anonymity concerns for the user and a focal point for an attacker.  \n\n7 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Introduction  \nIn a world where communications requirements seem to change as soon as specifications are \nfielded, the expected high technology adoption of smart households, sma rt grids, and smart meters \nwill require a large number and high density of Internet of Things devices  cellular wireless network \nconnectivity  to be efficient and cost -effective. The best way to field such a 5G telecommunication \nsystems  is to divide a networ k into slices - principally , a way to provide similar communication \nservices with similar network characteristics to different vertical industries.3 \nA standard 5G standalone network  consist s of user equipment connected by an over -the-air link to \na radio access network, which then interfaces with the core network. In a 5G standalone \ninfrastructure, network slicing is a network architecture  that enables multiplexing of independent \nlogical networks . The multiple logical networ ks may share  the same physical resources \n(computer s, networking, network resources, management, and administrators) . This sharing has \nthe potential to enable more efficient resource utilizations  and enable s cost savings  with  the \npotential expense of lesser  assurances of confidentiality, integrity, and availability  triad.  \nA network slice  provides a virtual network service that connects an application running on user \nequipment, such as a cell phone or Internet of Things sensor, with applications that may be running \non other user equipment or servers that are connected to a data network.  \nThis document  assesses the current state of 5G network slic ing technology , including common \nindustry definitions, as well as physical an d logical architectural references,  and provides \ninformation necessary to understand and mitigate some potential threats to 5G network slicing . \nNetwork slicing can help augment  security of 5G systems and communications carried over 5G \nnetworks.  Logical iso lation of network traffic (both control and user -planes), 5G network functions \nand other compute workloads, and storage of subscriber profiles and other data could help protect \ninformation in one slice if another slice were to be compromised.   \nAdditional authentication and authorization , as well as specialized policies and configurations , can \nbe applied on a per -slice basis.  Security elements, monitoring, and analytics could also be \ncustomized per slice.  Many of these concepts would help apply a Zero Trust  Architecture paradigm \nto the network slice itself, noting that the capabilities and options for a network slice may vary by \noperator and does not address zero trust  beyond the slice, e.g., in the operators network, external \ndata networks, and the applica tion itself.  \nThe logical isolation afforded by network slicing for network function s and more generally \ncompute tasks deserves additional discussion.  Logical isolation, in this context, could mean \ncompute tasks separated in virtual machines or in container s, and those workloads may or may not \nbe run on the same physical machine or interconnected set of physical machines.   \nIn the case of the same physical machine, then the workloads may share the same hypervisor and \ncontainer execution engine; in the case of  separate physical machines but interconnected group of \nmachines, then the systems themselves share network connectivity and the workloads may share \nthe same orchestration system.   \nTaking logical isolation one step further, a specific network slice could b e configured such that its \n \n3 3GPP TS 23.501  \n\n8 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   network functions  and other related workloads are executed only on a dedicated set of physical \nmachines, which host no other compute tasks; noting, however, the isolated group of physical \nmachines may share network connectivity, orchestration systems, and human administrators with \nother slices.  \nFrom a security perspective , network slic ing is a logical part of a larger system, where security is \ninherently intertwined.  Network slicing provides benefits and trade -offs, from both func tional and \nsecurity perspectives , that must be considered.   \nExisting alternatives  to network slicing, depending on use case, include :  \n Using a custom fourth -generation technology  for broadband cellular networks 4G Access \nPoint Name or 5G Data Network Name to logically separate some network traffi c. This does \nnot provide all the functionality of a n end -to-end network slice . \n Implementing a Mobile Virtual Network Operator model which requires significant \ninvestment in cost and time.  \n Deployment of a private 5G network infrastructure, which could be a private 5G non -\nstandalone or private 5G standalone, that could implement 5G network slices , or a \ncombination of both private 5G non -standalone and private 5G standalone.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   PRINCIPLES  AND CONCEPTS  \nWhat is Network Slicing?  \n5G network slicing is a network architecture that provides a way to divides a network to provide \nindependent logical networks over physical network resources and functionality . This  can help \noperators provide differentiated services and more quickly deploy new cases.  An operator can use \nnetwork slicing to logically allocate physical resources across one or more slices, where each slice \nmay have a different Quality of Service (QoS) and other performance characteristics , as well as \nconfigurations and policies , to meet a variety of use cases and possibl e Service Level Agreements  \n(SLAs) . For example, a slice supporting mobile broadband users requires high data rates and \ntraffic volumes, a  slice supporting Internet of Things  devices may optimize high -density devices \nand power consumption, and a slice supporting autonomous driving may provide high -reliability \nand low -latency communications . \nMobile Network Infrastructure  \nThe 5G ecosystem uses  radio resources for some part of the communication between an originating \nand a destination application. While there are standards defining specifications for how operators \nbuild their 5G networks, but currently network slice specifications  requirements a re insufficient \nand need to evolve for the develop ment , implement ation , and maint enance of security for network \nslicing.  \nCurrently network slice specifications  do not get into the implementation detail level and allow for \nwide ranging varying of the networ k slice implementations.   The placement of functional \ncomponents onto a physical  computing platform is a choice that may affect the level of service \nprovided by the network slice. Multiple functions may run on the same computing platform or may \nbe distribu ted across multiple computing platforms . \nUser Equipment  \nUser Equipment (U E) consists of the Mobile Equipment (ME) and the Universal Integrated Circuit \nCard (UICC), where the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application resides.   \n \nThe UICC, also referred to as Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards, are used to store U E-specific \ncredentials required for access to an operator network. The credentials are used as part of the 5G \nAuthentication and Key Agreement ( 5G-AKA ) or Extensible Authentication Protocol Authentication \nand Key Agreement Prime ( EAP -AKA ) authentication p rocedures before establishing connectivity \nwith the operators 5G network. The UICC also has the capability to run network security \napplications in a secure and trusted environment.  \n \nIn the design  of device  system  architecture,  network  slicing  features  require  the coordination  \nbetween  the upper  operating  system  and the lower  communication  modem.   Table  1 shows  two \nways  to implement  network  slicing  features  in the device  system  architecture:   \n \n\n10 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Table 1: Traffic  to network  slice  matchi ng schemes   \nScheme   Description   \nModem -centric   The modem  matches  traffic  by its attributes  to a network  slice.   \nOS-centric   The operating  system  matches  traffic  by its attributes  to a network  slice.   \n \nImplementation  of these  two schemes  may  include  changes  to the operating  system  and application \nprogramming interface s (API), respectively.  The overall  impact  of this is determining  that  \nthe network  slice  termination  point  will be on the 5G device  in one of three  locations:  \n Modem ,  \n Operating  System , and  \n Application.    \n \nThe UE Route  Selection  Policy  (URSP)  is a set of rules  for routing  application  packets  to the \nappropriate  network  slice.   Input  to the policy  includes:  \n Network Slice Selection Assistance Information  (NSSAI),   \n Protocol Data Unit  (PDU)  session,   \n Session  and Service  Continuity  (SSC)  mode,  and \n Type  of access  (e.g.,  3GPP  or non-3GPP  such  as Wi-Fi4)). \n \nThe URSP  rule  is composed  of Traffic  Descriptor  (TD)  and Route  Selection  Descriptors  (RSD).  The \napplication  specifies  the TD and the modem  uses  the TD to look  for a URSP  rule  matched  to the TD. \nBased  on policies,  the URSP  rules  can be updated  based  on netw ork conditions  (e.g.,  overload  \nconditions).   \nTransport Networks  \nIntroduction  \nTransport networks are the connective links  between the network connected elements that \nimplement a network slice between two elements .   \nTransport Networks  Inside  of the Mobile Operator Network  \nTransport networks are categorized by the types of elements that they connect. The fronthaul  \nnetwork connects the radio unit to a distributed unit in the radio access network ( RAN) . The mid -\nhaul  network connects a distributed unit to the other elements in the RAN, including the central \nunit. The backhaul network transports the user plane and the control plane to the 5G core.  The 5G \ncore network  connects  all NFs and repositories in the 5G core. Th e user plane function  (UPF ) \nconnects applications and services that are outside of the 5G system via a data network.  \nTransport Networks  Outside of the Mobile  Operator  Networ k \nTo meet organizational needs, many 5G networks need to connect to data, applicati ons, and devices \noutside the 5G network boundary. These connected data networks may have wide -ranging \n \n4 Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi -Fi Alliance.  \n\n11 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   topologies and support a wide range of protocols at the Internet, transport, and application layers. \nIt is critical to mission success that network planne rs, implementors, and operators carefully plan \nfor these connections to ensure continued confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mission -\ncritical data across a full end-to-end ( E2E ) connection. The N6 Reference Point  demarks the \nboundary between the 5G network and external data networks.                            \nWhile most of  this paper focuses on network slicing exclusively within the context of an operator \ncontrolled 5G network, it is important to note that many d ata network protocols also support \nnetwork slicing natively  or will soon develop the ability to do so5.  Even when an external \nnetwork does not support slicing natively, when properly configured and coordinated it can often \nextend specified Quality of S ervice (QoS), and latency service levels that a 5G network slice \nprovides. A network slice that originates on a 5G network can be delivered across non -5G data \nnetworks  to provide E2E  service; critically, this will extend the physical and logical reach of 5G \nnetworks to connect users with needed applications and data outside the 5G boundary. With well -\norchestrated internetworking, certain critical features might be supported E2E  for customer s. \n5G interworking is rapidly evolving. Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) are rapidly \ndeveloping non -5G slicing standards and protocols  (e.g., the Internet Engineering Task Force  \n(IETF )6)7, while those SDOs work along with 3GPP to update 5G data network  interworking \nstandards that connect to these and other services  while enabling E2E automation of service \nfulfillment and service assurance.  \nRadio Access Networks  \nThe RAN  logically connects radio unit (RU) interfaces through distributed units (DU) and at l east \none central unit (CU) and to the interface of multiple network  function s in the core network .  \nRANs have evolved as technology has evolved. Today RANs can support multiple -input, multiple -\noutput (MIMO) antennas, wide spectrum bandwidths, multi -band ca rrier aggregation, and more.  \n \nFigure 1: RAN in a 5G System  \n5G Core Network  \nThe 5G core network  consists of several well -defined services called network functions .  An \nnetwork function  refers to  either an abstract service definition or an instance of that service.  An \ninstance of a n network function  may be shared by multiple network slices or may be allocated \n \n5 See MEF 84: Subscriber Network Slice Service and Attributes  document.  \n6 https://www.ietf.org/  \n7 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft -ietf-teas -ietf-network -slice -framework/  \n\n\n12 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   exclusively to one slice.  \nA network function  instance  that provides a service is referred to as the producer network function , \nand a n network function  instance that uses a service is referred to as the consumer network \nfunction .  The implementation of a  network function  may be physical, virtual, or cloud native. \nNetwork function s utilize a cloud nat ive design to enable flexible scaling and upgrades.   \nThe number of network function  services can be scaled up or down as needed.  As a result, 5G \nnetwork function s can be quickly created, deployed, and scaled, using automated life cycle \nmanagement. An example 5G core network  is depicted in  Figure 2.  \n \nUE (R)AN UPF DNN2 N4N1\n N9 NSSF NEF NRF PCF UDM AF\nNSSAAF AUSF AMF SMF SCP NSACFNnssf Nnef Nnrf Npcf Nudm Naf\nNnssaaf Nausf Nanf Nsmf Nnsacf\nN3 N6UDR\nNudr\nCHFNchfSEPP\nN3IWFNn3iwf\nUse-case \ndependentNFs used \nfor Slicing\n \nFigure 2: 5G Core Architecture Containing the NFs  \nThe control a nd user plane function al separation (CUPS)  architecture enhancement was introduced \nin evolved packet core (EPC) and the same continues in the 5G core .  This separation allows the  \ncontrol  plane  functions to interact with multiple user plane  functions and in turn provides for more \nscalable deployment choices. The NFs that have been introduced by 3GPP for supporting  network \nslicing within the control plane are the Network Slice Selection Function ( NSSF), Network Slice -\nspecific Authentication and Authorization Function (NSSAAF) , and the Network Slice Admission \nControl Function (NSACF).  \nInterconnect and Roaming  \nRoaming  for 5G network  slicing  require s several  new  capabilities , network  slicing standards,  and \nbusiness  agreements  to be developed . If agreements  exist  between  service  providers,  then  roaming  \noccurs  when  there is an interconnection  between  the users  home  network  and another  mobile  \nnetwork.   \nRoaming between  mobile network operators (M NOs) typically take place in two difference ways - \nvia direct connections between each MNO, or via an IP Service Interconnection (IPX).  An IPX \nfacilitates  interconnection between MNOs  according to agreed inter -operable service definitions \nand commercial agreements.  \n\n13 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   The GSM Association (GSMA )8 provides technical guidance to MNOs  for connecting their IP -based \nnetworks and services together to achieve roaming and/or inter -working services between them.  \nRoaming services enable mobile subscribers to use services in countries or areas outside of their \nhome networks. Roaming is only u sable in areas or countries where MNOs have signed a roaming \nagreement. Connections can be  established, and roaming agreements can be signed between MNOs \nto ensure service continuity while roaming. Roaming agreements allow MNOs to set policies to \ncontrol n etwork access for roaming subscribers and manage roaming services.  \nComponents of a 5G Network Slice  \nRoles  \n5G network s lices may be designed and managed by various entities. The recognized worldwide \nleaders of 5G standards creation - the 3rd Generation Par tnership Project (3GPP)9 and the GSMA - \ndefine multiple roles related to network slicing, specifying them in publications 3GPP TS 28.530 \nand NG.116, respectively. The roles of relevance  used in this paper , in no  particular order,  are:  \n Network Operator  (NO P), \n Network Slice Customer  (NSC) , \n Network Slice Provider  (NSP) , and \n Network Slice User  (NSU ).10 \n \nDepending upon the  scenario (s): \n Each role can be filled  by one or more organizations simultaneously.  \n An organization can fill one or more  roles simultaneously ( e.g., a company can fill the NOP  \nand NSP  roles simultaneously).11 \n5G System Components  \nNetwork slicing is a crucial piece of technology that allows for the needs of each industry/or \norganization to be fulfilled by having multiple logical networks to be tailored and created on top of \nshared physical infrastructure: Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network, Transport Network \n(TN) , and a service orchestrator.   \nThe life -cycle management of a slice includes slice design, the virtualized network function ( VNF ) \non-boarding, network preparation to support the slice, slice creation and instantiation, \noperationalizing, and day -to-day management of the slices including scaling in/out based on \nservice assurance. Service assurance is pr ovided by constant supervision/monitoring, reporting, \nand modifying the network in an automated manner. Modification s may involve configuration \nchanges, instantiation of network s and/or network function  resources.   \n \n \n \n8 https://www.gsma.com/  \n9 https://www.3gpp.org/  \n10 Although this distinction is not acknowledged by 3GPP or GSMA, ESF ascertains there is a difference between a \nnetwork slice customer and a network slice user.  \n11 3GPP TS 28.530  \n\n14 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   The implementation of a network slice consists of multiple interconnected elements across some or \nall the access, core, and data network domains : \nAs previously mentioned, the RAN  logically connects the RU interfaces through DUs  and at \nleast one CU and to the interface of a network functi on in the core network.  \nAs previously mentioned , the core network  consists of several well -define d network \nfunction s. A network function  can an abstract service definition or an instance of that \nservice. An instance of a network function  may be shared by multiple NSs or may be \nallocated exclusively to one slice.  \nThe data network  (DN) is a non -5G TN that connects elements in the core network to \napplications or services outside of the 5G network.  \nService orchestration frameworks ( Management and Network Orchestration  (MANO ), Open \nNetwork Automation Platform  (ONAP) , etc) are popular means to provide life -cycle management of \na network slice  and servi ces. \n \n \nFigure 3: The Life Cycle of Service / Slice Instance Orchestration12 \nThe ETSI MANO framework has been used as an example framework ; however, the security \nfeatures, controls and mitigations mechanisms described in this paper are generic enough and \ntherefore would be applicable to any service orchestration framework.  \nNetwork Slice Composition  \nA network slice is composed of portions of the 5G netw ork resources that collectively implement a \nlogical network. The components are selected and configured so that the network slice provides a \nspecified level of service.  \nFrom an application point of view, a network slice provides a connection to another app lication or \nservice. The network slice is implemented by active components in one or more access, core, and \ndata networks.  \nEach of those components is a service or function, hosted on a computing platform. Each computing \nplatform may be physical or virtual . Each component consumes resources and may also consume \nother services. The placement of components onto computing platforms is a policy choice made to \nassure a negotiated level of service. Thus, the implementation of a network slice may include many \ncomp uting platforms.  \nA network slice may use entirely physical resources, or it may consist of a mix of physical and \nvirtual resources. In 5G, network slicing allow s operators to create logical  data pipelines and \n \n12 Derived from 3GPP.  \n\n\n15 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   control/management functions for each type of s ervice, thereby assuring the requirements of  each \nservice.  \nFigure 4  illustrates a sample composition of network slices. Each network slice is a logical resource \nthat is provisioned to deliver a level of service. The level of service delivered by a composit ion of \nnetwork slices is typically different from the level of service delivered by each component network \nslice. That level can be higher, lower, or the same as the levels of service of each of the component \nnetwork slices.  \nEnd End slice\nslice\nslice slice slicesliceService Client Over -the-top connection\nsliceEnd End\nEnd End End End End EndEnd End End End\nData network Access network Core network\n \nFigure 4: Network Slice Composition  \nA network slice might span across multiple network domains used by a n NSP ( e.g., access network, \ncore network, and transport network) and is comprised of dedicated and/or shared resources  in \nterms of functionality, processing power, storage, and bandwidth. A network slice available in the \nHome Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) to their own subscribers may also be available when \nthe subscribers UE is roaming.  \nA fully E2E  enabled slice requires support across each of the domains shown in Table  2, not all \nwhich support slicing at the time of this documents publication .   \nTable 2:  \nNetwork Slicing Domains  \nDomain  Description  \nRAN Slicing  The next natural step, once slicing aware Radio Resource Management  policy \nmanagement and associated models get consolidated.  \nCore Network \nSlicing  5GC was designed to support network slicing from the very beginning, i.e., \n3GPP Rel -15. Since the 5GC is clo ud-native consists of a microservice \narchitecture, dynamic slicing will be easier and available earlier.  \nTransport \nNetwork Slicing  Programmable service -tailored connectivity throughout the E2E  data path, \nacross all network segments (fronthaul, midhaul, ba ckhaul) a nd technology \ndomains (IP/  Multiprotocol Label Switching , optical, microwave). The existing \nheterogeneity (in terms of resources and topology) on the transport underlay \nmakes TN slicing a challenge, and naturally the last part to be consolidated. \nThis requires the completion of Software Defined Network Controller (SDN -C) \nstandards and a wider adoption of SDN technology across the different \ndomains . \n \nA Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (NSSAI)  is used to identify a network slice \nuniquely within the NOP domain . The UE subscription information can contain at least one default \n\n16 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   NSSAI to be used when the UE performs initial registration.  \nThe Access Management Function (AMF ), or the NSSF of the serving Public Mobile Network  \n(PLM N), maps the subscribed NSSAI values from the home PLM N to the respective NSSAI values  \nbeing used in the serving PLM N. This mapping is based on PLMN  policy or on agreements between \nthe visited and home PLM Ns. \nNetwork Slice Service Level Cha racteristics  \nOrganizations like the 3GPP, GSMA , IETF , and the MEF13 have specified service level characteristics  \n(SLCs)  that describe aspects of a provided network slice. From their documents, a working group of \ngovernment and industry experts, led by ESF,  identified over 90 independent SLCs .  \nService  level characteristics can be used to specify service level requirements  (SLRs) , including \nsecurity and other, on a network slice. When applicable, additional SLCs , such as described in the \nGSMA Generic Network Slice Template (NEST)  document , can be used. SLCs  related to QoS are \ndefined in the  3GPP TS 23.501  document.  \nEach identified SLC is described by the attributes shown in Table 3 below:  \nTable 3:  \nAn Example Service Level Characteristic Value14 \nEach network slice can provide the agreed service level for specific functionality requested from \ndifferent service providers or tenants.  \nSLRs  on a network slice specify NSC  requirements. A meaningful implementation of a network slice \nmust be able to determine when customer's r equirements are not met. Each network slice SLC is \nintended to specify a metric that is measurable within a network slice implementation.  \n \n13 https://www.mef.net/   In 2015, the Metro Ethernet Forum voted to shorten its name to MEF to better reflect i ts expansion \ninto setting standards for network virtualization.  \n14 This table was developed within the Network Slice service level characteristics subgroup.  Attribute  Description  \nName  A meaningful alphanumeric identifier for the characteristic.  \nExample: packetDelayBudget  \nDescription  A meaningful statement of the purpose and behavior of the characteristic.  \nExample: An upper bound in milliseconds for the time that a packet may be \ndelayed between the UE and the UPF that terminates the N6 interface. For a \ncertain 5QI, the value of the PDB is the same for uplink and downlink.  \nUnit of Measure  An expression that specifies a standard of measurement (UCUM).  \nExample: ms  \nMultiplicity  The possible number of values: Scalar (zero or one) or Array (zero or more).  \nExample: Scalar  \nType  A specification of the range of possible values; Specified as either an enumerated \nlist, or as a simple data type (ex: Boolean, integer, float, or string).  \nExample: Integer  \n\n17 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Each SLRs  specifies a value for SLC. That value is then used to determine if the implementation \nmeets the SLRs . Multi ple values may be specified for a SLC that is an array.  \nExample : An SLR on the latency between a UE and the UPF can be specified as a requirement \nthat the packetDelayBudget is 300 ms.  \nTwo strategies are used to simplify the specification of SLRs :  \nFirst , there is no need to specify a SLC when any of its possible values are sufficient to meet \nthe customer's requirements. No implementation assumptions are to  be made for service \nlevel char acteristics which  are not referenced by a n SLR.  \nSecond , the remaining SLCs  can be bundled into standard, or industry defined subsets called \nnetwork slice profiles ( e.g., 3GPP 5G QoS Identifier (5QI) ). When applicable, standardized \n5QI values described the re can be used.  \nNetwork Slice Profile  \nA network slice profile is the set of SLRs  that are applicable to the constituents of a network slice. \nThese include both the NFs and the connecting transport networks.  \nAn example of a network slice profile is the 5G Q oS model, specified  in 3GPP TS 23.501  and \nshown in Table 4 . The set of 5G QoS network slice characteristics are:  \n averagingWindow,  \n maximumDataBurstVolume,  \n packetDelayBudget,  \n packetErrorRate,  \n priorityLevel,  \n resourceType.  \n \nEach combination of values for these six characteristics is assigned a 5QI. Each 5QI identifier \nimplies the corresponding values for the six corresponding network slice characteristics. \nTable 4 shows the standard values for 5QI = 2.  \nTable 4:  \n3GPP Specified Values for 5QI = 2  \nCharacteristic  Value  \naveragingWindow  2000  \nmaximumDataBurstVolume  N/A  \npacketDelayBudget  150 ms \npacketErrorRate  1.00E -02 \npriorityLevel  40 \nresourceType  GBR  \n \nA network slice can be composed from multiple lower -level network slices. Each segment is \nrepresented by a NetworkSliceSubnet . Regardless of how a network slice how is implemented, its \nnetwork slice profile defines the requirements that need to be  met.  \n\n18 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   In addition to authentication and authorization measures, confidentiality  requires protection of \ndata within  a network slice both while that data is in transit or while at rest (i.e., stored in transient \nor persistent storage). Transmission methods include , but are not limited to, shared memory, data \nbusses o r networks within a computing platform, and networks between computer platforms. \nStorage includes any type of persistent, or transient storage device .  \nTwo methods used to protec t against data  leakage are  isolation and encryption. Isolation can be \nphysical or virtual. Dedicated physical resources are required for physical isolation. Isolation may \nbe accomplished using virtual resources, such as sessions, or virtual storage with restricted acces s. \nThe level of isolation and encryption are governed by the SLRs  specified for a network slice. The \nimplementation of the network slice is responsible for assuring that all functional components \nsufficiently support the confidentiality , integrity, and ava ilability  requirements.   \nAvailability requirements for a network slice are specified as part of its SLRs . The implementation \nof the network slice is responsible for assuring that the functional components provide sufficient \ncapability to meet those availab ility requirements. The NSC can negotiate with NSPs  to agree on a \nservice profile for each over -the-top connection . For example, a network slice service profile might \ninclude a  missionCriticalCapabilitySupport of High or an availability requirement of High.  \nNetwork Slice Service Profile  \nFigure 5  shows an abstract  model for slice and service profiles that is derived from 3GPP TS 28.541 .  \nIt is intended to illustrate the relationship between SLCs  and SLRs to the slice and service profiles \ndefined by 3GPP. Requirements need to be  specified by a slice profile. Slice specific requirements \nwill evolve over time to contain new requirements beyond those currently captured by 3GPP.     \nAn NSP is responsible for  evalua ting  their customer use cases to determine the set of network \nslices that need to be provided. Each  network slice  can be characterized by the requirements that \nmet by the respective NSP. The NSP has an obligation to  match those requirements with existi ng \nslice profiles, such as those from GSMA. If necessary, modify or add SLRs  as needed to meet the \ndesign requirements.   \nAs shown  in Figure 5 , network slice requirements are defined by associating a value to one or more \nnetwork slice characteristics. By p reference, network slice characteristics from the GSMA ought to  \nbe used. If an appropriate characteristic is not defined there, in 3GPP TS 23.50 1, or in this \ndocument , a new network slice characteristic can be defined as previously discussed in this paper . \nCustom network slice requirements are created by choosing values for each of the chosen set of \nnetwork slice characteristics. The completed set of network slice requirements is then associated \nwith a network service profile. That profile is the basis for a service level agreement (SLA) between \nan NSC and an NSP.  The NSC can negotiate with NSPs  to agree on a service profile for each over -\nthe-top connection.   \n \n\n19 \n \nTLP: CLEAR    \nFigure 5: Network Slice Model  \nSecurity Management of a Network Slice  \nOnce a network slice has been designed and implemented, it enters the operations phase of the \nlifecycle. This phase includes activation, modification, and deactivation of the network slice. \nActivation of a network sli ce must  not commence until all SLRs  have been met. Ideally, the network \nslice needs to stay  activated throughout the intended deployment period until deactivation. \nHowever, mission objectives or the operational conditions might change over time, so \nmodific ations to the network slice might be needed during the deployment period so that specific \nSLRs  are met.  \nA baseline of security related network slicing features must be established for day -to-day \noperations. Those features must support confidentiality , integrity, and availability  requirements.  \nZero trust architecture (ZTA) methodology can be implemented and exercised to ensure the secure \nactivation, supervision, reporting, modification, and the de -activation of a slice.  \nTo ensure smooth network slice opera tions, these security features need  be deployed as might be \nrecommended by the 3GPP. 3GPP standards define fu nctionalities of Communication Service \nManagement Function (CSMF), the Network Slice Management Function (NSMF), and the Network \nSlice Subnet Manag ement Function (NSSMF).  These interact with functions of the Operations \nSupport System  and Business Support System  (OSS/BSS) , and the Virtualized Network Function \nManager (VNFM ) within the MANO architecture. These three  components plus the capability \nexposure platform make up the network slice m anagement components.  \n\n\n20 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Network Slice Orchestration Frameworks  \nThe ETSI MANO and ONAP service  orchestration frameworks have been developed with detailed \nspecifications that support the design, deployment, operations, and maintenance phases of slices . \nIn short, the life cycle of a slice can be carried out in an automated manner.  \nMANO define s an NFV architecture that enables  design, management, and allocation of virtual \ninfrastructure resources to VNFs and slices . The main functional blocks within the NFV -MANO are:  \n \n Network Functions Virtualization Orchestrator (NFVO),  \n Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM), and  \n Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM)  \n \nAdditional functionalities that have been defined for managing containerized VNFs are the \nContainer Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and the Container Image Registry (CIR) \nfunctions. The CISM is responsible for maintaining the containerized workloads while the CIR is \nrespons ible for storing and maintaining information of operating system container software \nimages. The behavior of the NFVO and VNFM is driven by the contents of deployment templates \n(a.k.a. NFV descriptors) such as a Network Service Descriptor (NSD) and a VNF De scriptor (VNFD).  \nThe 3GPP defined functionalities of the NSMF and the NSSMF map to functionalities within the \nOSS/BSS, and the VNFM within the MANO architecture.  \nONAP is an open -source platform that enables product -independent capabilities for design, \ncrea tion, and life cycle management of network services. The ONAP E2E  Network Slicing Use Case \nrealizes functionality of a slice across 5G RAN, core, and transport network slice subnets. The Use \nCase demonstrates the modeling, orchestration (life cycle and res ources) and assurance of a \nnetwork slice implemented in alignment with relevant 3GPP, ETSI, IETF, and other standards.15 \n5G Threat Vectors  \nThere are many threat vectors  that affect a 5G network slice . Of these, Denial of Service (DoS) \nattacks on the signaling plane, Misconfiguration Attacks, and Man -in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks \npose significant risks to network slicing. Relative to the commonly known confidentiality , integrity, \nand availability  triad, DoS directl y attacks the availability of the system and its functionality , \nincluding  loss of access to  the 5G infrastructure , loss of  access to remote data,  or compromised  \ncommunication services.  \nZTA methodology can help harden a  5G deployment; a big part of ZTA can  be accomplished by \nemploy ing authentication, authorization, and audit (AAA) techniques. Proper implementation of \nauthentication and authorization can also mitigate threat vectors stemmed from misc onfiguration \nattacks.  \nBoth misconfiguration attacks and MIT M attacks can have a broad range of adverse effects on \nconfidentiality , integrity, and availability . Misc onfiguration attacks  refers to a situation where \nadversaries take advantage of misconfigured system controls. It might include security features \n \n15 https://docs.onap.org/projects/onap -integration/en/latest/docs_E2E_network_slicing.html#e2e -network -slicing -\nuse-case  \n\n21 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   that a re inadvertently turned off or system monitoring services being disabled.  \nMITM attacks imply that the adversary secretly relays and possibly alters the communications \nbetween two endpoints. Such an attack could be devastating as misinformation and disinfo rmation \ncould be resulted. If ZTA principles are applied, this could be an effective means to help mitigate \nthese MITM 5G attacks . \nCyber hygiene must be followed to ensure cyber impacts due to inherent system vulnerabilities and \nmisconfigurations are minim ized:  \n ZTA  requires AAA techniques that are employed within and between all 5G  components and \nbetween supporting infrastructure  connected elements.  \n Perform cyber risk assessment periodically as new and emerging threats continue to be \nproduced  to the operating environment.  \nGoals for End -to-End Network Slicing  \nA network slice user data is shown flowing from the UE to the data network , passing through RAN  \nfunctions, TN, and the 5G Core. Orchestration frameworks ( e.g., MANO)  configures and orchestrates \nthe Open RAN , TN, and 5G Core to realize a network slice. The c ombination of all these system \ncomponents is the attack surface for the network slice user data flow.  \n \n \nFigure 6: End -to-End 5G Network Slicing Architecture  \nThe high-level goals for E2E 5G network slicing influences the network slice profile. The \nfollowing are some high-level security objectives for E2E 5G network slicing:  \n1) Ensure availability of the network slice  user data in transit as required by the NSC . \n2) Ensure integrity of network slic e user data in transit as required by the NSC . \n3) A network slice  must enforce the physical and logical constraints on its path over its \nlifetime.  \n4) A network slice  must ensure confidentiality of data in transit as required by its SLRs.  \n5) Ensure confidentiality o f the owner of the network slice user data in transit as required \nby the network slice customers.  \nSpecific use cases may comprise other high -level objectives for E2E  5G network slicing. The high -\nlevel security objectives address the following key asset s of a 5G  network slice:  \n Network slice user data flow.  \n Identity of NSCs and NSUs  using a network slice . \n Geographic location of the components  of a network slice.  \n \n\n\n22 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Specific use cases may comprise other key assets than what is enumerated  in the aforementioned \nlist for E2E  5G network slicing.  In this scenario, a single UE connected to two slice d to support two \ndifferent applications :  \n1) Demand from a large  number of live stream s of an on -site sporting event to enhance or \nargument the real time experience.  \na. Support many  subscribers.  \nb. Ultra -low latency (to match events in real time) and high bandwidth.  \ni. Use of edge compute (to minimize latency and minimize data network \nbackhaul requirements) . \nc. Potentially low confidentiality requirement . \n2) Support for real time update of fantasy sport team stats . \na. Support many  subscribers.  \nb. Ultra -low latency, low bandwidth, high frequency update of odds . \nc. High confidentiality, integrity, and a vailability  triad . \nd. A centralize real time scores statistics server system in a regional cloud . \n  \n\n23 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   DESIGN CRITERIA  \nNetwork Slice  \nThe requisite criteria to adequately define a 5G network slice is specified by the end -user \n(NSU/NSC ) in the form of a network slice service profile and confirmed by the supplier of the NSP .  \nA NSP implements a service that realizes a network slice. A n NSP  might implement multiple \nnetwork slices. Each network slice may be composed of one or more underlyi ng network sub-slices. \nAt the lowest level and without additional SLRs , a network slice is equivalent to the underlying \nphysical network. Conceptually, any composition of two or more underlying network slices is a new \nnetwork slice. The NSP  has the privile ges necessary to use the underlying network slices in the \nimplementation of the new composite network slice.  \nA network slice can be tailored based on the specific requirements agreed between customer and \nslice provider and can span across multiple network domains used by an NSP (e.g., access, core , \ntransport , and data networks ) and is comprised of dedicated and/or shared resources in terms of \nfunctionality, processing power, storage, and bandwidth.  \n5G network slic ing offer s a NSP the opportunity to increase  the utilization of their physical \ninfrastructure while meeting the SLRs of multiple NSCs. Currently NSCs must have significant in -\ndepth discussions with NSPs on meeting the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of slices by \nan NSP . 5G network slice  standards are immature/nonexistent regarding  confidentiality, integrity, \nand availability SLCs.  Standardization efforts  and adoptions by NSP s in this area is  required before  \nthe SLRs for confidentiality, integrity, and availability can be uniformly applied between operators.  \nCurrently, 5G network slic ing specifications do not prescribe how network slice are implemented.  \nFor instance, a fundamental tenet of the 3GPP is to create specificati ons, while implementation is \nleft to MNOs and mobile network vendors.  \nFigure 7 shows some the ways a n NSP might choose to implement 5G network slices. The potential \nvariability  and inconsistency will have significant effect on both the QoS and confidential ity, \nintegrity, and availability of the 5G network slice. Network slice s are implemented as independent \nlogical networks that are separated and managed for each service type within a common \ninfrastructure. Network slicing can guarantee the quality of data transmission for time -sensitive \nservices or mission -critical services, such as connected cars, by allocating isolated and dedicated \nresources.  \n \n\n24 \n \nTLP: CLEAR    \nFigure 7: Independent Logical Networks16 \nSlice #1 shares 5G core NFs  (Network Resource Function (NRF ), Policy Control \nFunction (PCF ), and Access Management Function ( AMF )) with Slice #2.  \nHowever, Slice #1 and Slice #2  do not share other NFs ( Session Management \nFunction ( SMF ) and UPF ) and may have their own additional dedica ted PCF for each \nof their slices.  \nSlice #3 does not share any NFs with the other two slices and therefore from a core \nnetwork perspective it is isolated from the other two, even though the access \nnetwork ( e.g., RAN) is shared between all the three slices.  \n \n Network Slice Service Profile Recommendations  \n Establish and define a comprehensive list of the slice profile s (across all SLAs ) to be \naccommodated by the NSP . \n Establish the types and requirements  of the UE that will connect to the RAN  for each \nindividual slice profile (across all SLAs ) accommodated by the subject 5G network.  \n Establish the types and capabilities of data networks that will connect to the N6 Interf ace \nfor each individual  slice profile (across all SLAs ) accommodated by the subject 5G network \nslice . \n Establish the full list, and associated metric value ranges ( e.g., SLRs ), of all SLCs  contained \nwithin the slice profile s (across all SLAs ) accommodated by the subject 5G network slice.  \n Establish the maximum of number of concurrent slices, for each individual slice profile \n(across all SLAs), that will be accommodated by the subject 5G network slice . \n Establish the requisite combinations (includ ing types and quantities) of component NSPs  \n(across all SLAs) that will be concurrently accommodated by the subject 5G network slice .  \n \n16 From 3GPP web  \n\n\n25 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   \n Establish the method, frequency, requisite response timing, and prioritization policies for \nthe dynamic administration of  network slicing across all SLAs accommodated by the \nsubject 5G network.  \n  Define each network slice service profile using SLR names and values as specified by 3GPP, \nGSMA, or other industry or standards development bodies.  \n Before provisioning, the NSP assu res the requested network slice  can conform to requested \nSLRs and other requirements.  \n  Changes to the security or other requirements of an existing network slice  is denied if the \nNSP cannot assure that the implementation of that network slice  will conform to the \nrequested changes.  \n  Once provisioned, the implementation of a network slice  continues to conform to the \nrequirements specified when the network slice  was p rovisioned or modified.  \n  Evaluate and confirm that the subject 5G network can accommodate the types and \nrequirements specified by the NS service profile.  \n  Evaluate and confirm that the subject 5G network can concurrently accommodate the \nrequisite combinat ions (including types and quantities) of individual slice profiles (across \nall SLAs).  \n  Evaluate and confirm that the subject 5G network can accommodate the method, \nfrequency, requisite response timing, and prioritization schema for the dynamic \nadministrati on of network slicing across all SLAs.  \nOpen RAN  \n \nTo support the overall security goals described in the previous section  Goals for End -to-End \nNetwork Slicing , any Open RAN implementation must  meet the following security objectives:  \n Ensure the confidentia lity, integrity, and availability triad of the network slice user data in \ntransit within the Open RAN . \n Ensure integrity of the physical and logical path of the network slice user data within the \nOpen RAN.  \n Ensure confidentiality of the identity of the owner of the network slice user data within the \nOpen RAN.  \n Ensure confidentiality  of the geographic location of the network slice user data within the \nOpen RAN . \nAlthough there are many methods to compromise a network slice,  the design of an Open RAN  \nimpleme ntation  should specifically mitigate unauthorized access and misconfiguration \ncompromises . The remainder of this Open RAN section addresses these security objectives and \nmitigations for an Open RAN based on O -RAN Alliance specifications.17 \nUnauthorized acc ess to a network slice within an O -RAN system requires access to the 5G System \nuser plane and control plane. The 5G System provides for optional Packet Data Convergence \nProtocol  (PDCP ) confidentiality and data integrity mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access of \nthe user plane and control plane within the O -RAN system . If these mechanisms are not \n \n17 https://www.o -ran.org/  \n\n26 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   implemented by an operator, then an attacker could have access to the user plane and cont rol \nplane within the entire O -RAN system .  \nO-RAN supports optional 3GPP confidentiality and data integrity mechanisms for the N2 and N3 \nback haul interfaces between the 5G RAN and 5G Core17. If these optional mechanisms are not \nimplemented by an operator, then a  threat actor could have access to the 5G system (5GS) user \nplane  and control plane  between the O -RAN system and the 5G Core.   \nLike any component of a 5G RAN, the CU requires security controls to prevent unauthorized access \nto the user plane  and cont rol plane . A virtualized CU requires similar security controls.18192021 \nMisc onfiguration exploits  target the availability and integrity of a network slice. An O-RAN  system  \nmisconfiguration attack on the availability of a network slice could deny service with precision \nranging from targeting an operator RAN down to a specific network slice. An O-RAN system \nmisconfiguration attack on the integrity of a network slice could modify the physical and/or logical \npath of the network slice user data in transit from RU to CU.  \nAn O-RAN system  misconfiguration attack surface consists of the system that manages O-RAN \nnetwork functions and transport networks. As illustrated in Figure 8 below , the system is known as \nthe Service Management and Orchestration framework (SMO).22 Many features of the SMO follow \nthe network orchestration and management systems defined by 3GPP, ETSI, and ONAP.  \n \nFigure 8: O-RAN Service Managem ent and Orchestration  \nThe Management and Orchestration section describes the attacks, attack surface, and potential \nmitigations for service orchestration frameworks.

The ESF \npublication Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations  discusses rApp and non -RT RIC \nsecurity objectives, threats, and mitigations.  \nThe SMO consists of management interfaces t o O-RAN NFs as shown in Figure 8. The O1 interface \nmanages the DU, CU, and other ORAN NFs. The Non -RT RIC manages the Near -Real -time (Near -RT) \nRIC network function s using the A1 interface. The Open Fronthaul M -Plane interface manages the \nO-RAN Radio Unit s (O-RU)s. The O2 interface manages the O -Cloud, where the O -Cloud is the cloud \ninfrastructure for the O -RAN system. Security controls must  be in place to help prevent an attacker \nfrom modifying O -RAN system configurations with unauthorized access to t hese interfaces.  \nTo address these and other O -RAN security concerns, see the recommendations for security \ncontrols and mitigation in ESF publication Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations .23 \nCore Network ing \nThe high -level potential threats that  have been identified to slicing with respect to the core \nnetwork , include attacks that may originate from UEs, unauthorized humans , and unauthorized \nmachines towards the core  NFs.  The attacks may include spoofing of customer specific  NSSAI by \nthe UEs and other identity thefts. Other attacks of this class include un -authorized access to \ncustomer  NFs by NFs from another slice using the control plane . For example,  when Unified Data \nManagement  (UDM) in one slice makes a request for subscription info rmation  of members of \nanother slice to a  unified data repository  (UDR ) that is in a different slice.  \nMisc onfiguration and tampering attacks can lead to Denial -of-Services (DoS) to legitimate slice \nusers. Examples of such attacks include:  \n Tampering of NSSAI inform ation when data is in flight between NFs (e.g., from UDR to UDM, \n5G radio node ( gNB ), and AMF etc.) ; \n Tampering of slice -specific data -usage ; \n Tampering slice -specific authentication data between NSSAAF and AMF ; \n Replay attacks ; and  \n Misconfiguring of slice -specific info ( e.g., NSSAI at the UDR, policies related to slices at the \nPCF, NSSF, charging and logs related to slices etc.) . \n \nPassive or active eavesdropping could lead to leakage of highly sensitive customer  slice  such as: \nleakage of NSSAI over the air, and subscriber info rmation  (e.g., Subscription Permanent Identifier \n(SUPI ), UE location information , subscription information , slice information ) as to who is using \nwhich slice may be leaked between slices. Also, leakage of slice -specific Network Information ( e.g., \nrouting information from NRF) and leakage of sensitive slice information to external networks ( e.g., \napplication function ). \nSignaling storms on N2, N3, and over service -based interfaces (SBI) can cause  DoS to legitimate \nslice users, and attacks from UE over N1  can impact N2 and N3 interfaces. Similarly attacks from N6  \n \n23 https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity -Collaboration -Center/Enduring -Security -Framework/  \n\n28 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   and N9 interfaces  could impact the customer -slice user plane .  \n Recommended Core Network Security Mitigations:  \n1) Security mitigations to protect the 5G system identified by the CSRIC VII24 include using \nnon-access stratum (NAS) signaling integrity and confidentiality between the UE and the \ncore network as well as using mutual Transport Layer Security  (TLS) -based authentication \nand secure communications between NFs using the service -based in frastructure. For NFs -\nto-NFs communications over non -SBI interfaces, CSRIC VII recommends using Internet \nProtocol Security (IPSec).  \n2) Use of network slice -specific authentication and authorization by leveraging a  Network \nSlice -Specific Authentication and Aut horization  (NSSAA) to protect against un -authorized \naccess to slices by UEs using NSC -specific credentials (these credentials are different from \nNOP credentials that are used for 5G -AKA).  \n3) Provide capability to e nable logical / physical isolation of the con trol plane and user -plane  \nNFs belonging to each of the NSCs. Each can provide  logical isolation of NSC slice subscriber \ninfo (e.g., using separate UDR instances per slice) and based on SLRs, provide physical \nisolation of NFs per slice (e.g., separate UDM /  Authentication Credential Repository and \nProcessing Function (APRF) by means of hardware security models )). \n4) Employ a dedicated intermediate certificate authority (ICA) that is used for life -cycle \nmanagement of the certificates issued to the NFs belonging to a particular slice . \n5) Employ an authorization server to provide attribute and role -based access control (RBAC) \nof humans and machines to perform per slice configuration, fault, and performance \nmanagement.  Ensure that slice -specific logging can also be per formed.  \n6) Employ a security vault to provide confidentiality and integrity of all sensitive and security \ndata ( e.g., private keys, open authorization [OAuth ] tokens, cert chains) used as part of \ncontrol and management plane messaging and to isolate sensitive  and security data from \nthe rest of the platform. This makes the data available only to the respective authorized NFs  \nwithin a slice . \n \nStore subscription information  associated with a NSCs subscriber within encrypted databases and \nemploy backup and data r ecovery processes from golden data. Protect subscriber data -at-rest \nusing a secure environment (e.g.,  hardware security module (HSM )). Similarly,  an HSM can be used \nto protect  applicable credentials used for network slice -specific authentication . \nUser Equipment  \nCurrent 3GPP 5G standards allow a UE to access up to eight  network slices. The 5G UE must be \nhardened  to prevent the UE from being used as a mean s for network  slices to interact \ninappropriately.  \nIn the design of device system  architecture, network slicing features require the coordination \nbetween the upper operating system and the bottom communication modem. Table 5 shows two \nways to implement network slicing features in the device system architecture:  \n \n24 https://www.fcc.gov/about -fcc/advisory -committees/communications -security -reliability -and-interoperability -council -vii \n\n\n29 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Table 5:  \nTraffic to Network Slice Matching Schemes  \nScheme  Description  \nModem -centric  The modem matches traffic by its attributes to a network slice.  \nOS-centric  The operating system matches traffic by its attributes to a network slice.  \n \nThe two approaches include two OS -Centric scheme solutions, namely, changes to the operating \nsystem and Application APIs respectively. The overall impact of this is determining where the \nnetwork slice termination point will be in on the 5G device in one of  three  locations:  \n The Modem , \n The Operating System , and/or  \n The Application.  \nTo hide details of data connection management and maintenance from applications, native \noperating system characterizes a data connection by network capability. Each network capabi lity \nstands for a certain kind of capability. Since operating system manages data connections based on \nAccess Point Name (APN) and Data Network Name (DNN), the capabilities associated to individual \nservices provided by system identified by the APN/DNN are the most important.  \nGiven the complexity of the OS -Centric scheme and fragmentation, the recommendation is to select \na modem centralization scheme\" which provide users with more diversified, flexible, and \nevolvable high -quality network slicing services.  However, the network slicing at the \nOS/Application layer provides greater flexibility and enhanced user experience at the same time.  \nIt is understood that  implementing an OS -Centric scheme for OS/applications is challenging since \nan operating system does  not natively support URSP  for the following reasons:   \n A URSP  rule is composed by a traffic descriptor (TD) and RSD s.  \n The upper layer ( e.g., an application) specifies the TD and the modem uses the TD to look for \na URSP  rule matched to the TD.  \n The modem with a matched TD tries to establish a PDU session using the corresponding \nRSDs in the order of precedence.  \n Since  operating system designs data connection framework based on APN type, the \noperating system can be modifie d for the reason explained below to use TDs . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n30 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Table 6:  \nThe following is an example URSP rule for enterprise traffic.  \nURSP  Rule ( enterprise)   \nPrecedence:   1 (0x01)   \nTraffic Descriptor  \nOperating System Id \n+ Operating System  \nApp Id Type 0x97A498E3FC925C9489860333D06E4E470A454E5445525052495345   \nRoute Selection Descriptor  \nPrecedence:   1 (0x01)   \nComponent #1:  \nS-NSSAI  SST:1 SD:2 (0x01000002)   \nComponent #2: DNN   enterprise   \n \n Recommended U ser Equipment  Security Mitigations : \n1) Start with the current  modem -centric approach, and then move to an OS -centric approach \nonce the issues about a standards -based uniform approach can be developed in the future.   \n2) When available, t erminate the slice in the application . This migh t provide greater security \nfrom a confidentiality or privacy perspective when compared to the current modem -centric \napproach.   \n3) Implement mobile device management (MDM) to protect network slice thus protecting the \ndevice since it is all self -contained.  MDM agents may not be applicable on all UEs. \n4) Protect NSSAI from being tampered and therefore recommend  storing it within a secure \nenvironment ( e.g., UICC) . \n5) Perform a uthentication and authorization of application requests to a ccess  a network slice .  \nCloud and Virtualization  \nMost 5G systems will be instantiated on virtualized compute, network, and storage resources;  and \nwill utilize on-premises virtual machine management (private cloud) or in commercial cloud \nplatforms (public cloud). Mapping most of the 5G system into the virtualized, managed resources of \na private or public cloud will require security controls on all use s of those resources.  \nDepending on the type of cloud deployment for 5G system, the set of security controls that are \nrequired to harden th e 5G system need to be considered and deployed appropriately. There are \nIndustry standards and guidance that provide the list of security controls . These are generic in \nnature and need to be configured specifically for the cloud provider/technology.  \nThe c onfiguration of the cloud controls depends on the responsibility for the security of the data, \nwhich depends upon the type of cloud deployment that is being leveraged such as Infrastructure as \na Service  (IaaS ), Platform as a Service  (PaaS ), Software as a Service  (SaaS) , etc.  \n \n\n\n31 \n \nTLP: CLEAR    Recommended Mitigations for Virtual Systems:  \n Ensure that controls implemented by the 5G system  cannot be bypassed using direct access \nto cloud resources.  \n Establish necessary network connections between the components o f the 5G system a re \nestablished and permit no other connections.  \n Protect data storage used by the 5G system  from access, tampering, or deletion by any \nunauthorized parties.  \n Establish and maintain mechanisms for monitoring operation of the 5G system , espec ially \nresource usage, actions of authorized cloud administrators, and network traffic flows. (This \nsupports both real -time and forensic analysis of cloud operation to support assurance for \nthe 5G services.)  \n \nA cloud platform (public or private) does two th ings to support the hardening of  network slicing:  \nprovide a foundation for overall 5G operations, and  provides resources  to set up, manage, monitor, \nand tear down security services and dynamic resources allocations for slices.  \nAssured 5G operations are f oundational to network slicing  To gain this assurance, 5G operators \nleverage cloud services in their design and deployment as described below. In all cases, the \nprinciple of least privilege is essential: assign to every person or non -person entity only t he \nprivileges and accesses necessary for operation.  \n Recommended Cloud Platform Hardening Mitigations : \n Employ cloud tenant separation mechanisms ( e.g., virtual private cloud) to ensure \nseparation between the 5G system  and other workloads within the supporting cloud \nplatform.  \n Employ cloud identity and access management (IAM) features to ensure that only \nauthenticated and authorized administrators can cr eate or alter cloud resource \nconfiguration s. Manage authorized identities centrally.  \n Configure monitoring mechanisms across the cloud platform (public or private) to record \nall critical actions and resource usage. (General principles for monitoring are giv en by NIST \nSP800 -92; specific guidance for each cloud platform is offered by that platforms vendor.)  \n Configure storage supporting the 5G system  to use access control, integrity assurance, and \nencryption, with keys managed by the cloud platform.  \n Configure network segmentation to separate user plane  from 5G  control plane  traffic .  \n Ensure that  control  plane  entities , such as VNFs /CNFs , have only necessary network \nconnectivity.  \n \nSecure instantiation of security services and allocation of securely configured r esources to assure \nthe integrity and selected security attributes of slices. To meet this objective, 5G operators can \nleverage  the resource management and security services offered by cloud platforms.  \nA network slice provides network connectivity for autho rized UEs while enforcing specific network \nperformance, integrity, and confidentiality guarantees. Therefore, certain entities ( such as VNFs) in \nthe 5G logical architecture possess privileges to dynamically allocate, manage, monitor, and \n\n\n32 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   deallocate network  paths to support slice operations.  \n Recommended Security Mitigations for Network Slice Creation:  \n Do not  configure such dynamic network assets manually ; instead , invoke an approved \ntemplate or script to set up the slice assets. (E.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)  \n Do not deploy  vulnerable components in production ; continuously monitor for new \nvulnerabilities and remediated . Follow guidance provided in National Institute of \nStandards and Technology ( NIST ) Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) PR.IP -12: A \nvulnerability management plan is developed and implemented . \n Employ  secure software development and operations processes for any code being used in  \nproduction, inc luding the management scripts and Infrastructure as Code  (IaaC ) scripts . \n Configure security controls, monitoring, and resource usage constraints onto the dynamic \nnetwork path and its elements before enabling operation or connecting any UEs to the slice.  \n Ensure that the network path resources/assets associated with the slice are owned by a \ndynamically created identity specifically designated for this purpose. ( e.g., provisioning a \ndedicated identity to serve as the owner for the slice aids separation betwe en slices and \nhelps with slice monitoring.)  \n Instantiate the requisite computing resources with an approved template , control image, or \nscript such as a dedicated VNF /CNF .  \nInterconnect & Roaming  \nRoaming between network operators is based on dedicated roaming agreements, which typically \nare established, along with technical requirements, prior to any roaming. This applies to network \nslicing roaming agreements too. Roaming agreements are necessary t o allow operators to configure \nan E2E  network that provides the desired overall functionality and service parameters. The GSMA \nbroadly outlines the content of such roaming agreements in standardized form.   \nFor network slice roaming to become a reality, several technical and business aspects first need to \nbe in place : \n \n MNOs need to rollout slicing in their mobile networks and have a network slice product \noffering.  \n Extended roaming agreements including slice definitions with SLAs based on slice \nattributes.  \n Operational support (management and orchestration, and service assurance) in roaming \nenvironments.  \n Global availability of slicing compatible UEs.  \n \nAn NSP can consider the following when procuring network slicing services : \n \n The visited network could provide to the roaming user a network slice with equivalent \nfunctionality of the slice used in the home network , e.g., the roaming partners may agree to \nsupport a common set of standardized slices.  \n\n\n33 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   \n The home network might export the blueprint of a custom ne twork slice used by a user so \nthat it can be instantiated and administered by the visited network.   \n The home network might extend the slice into the visited network, provided it has \nauthorization from the visited network to control the resources.  \n \nIntercon nection refers to the technical physical and logical connection between two or more MNOs. \nInterconnection is a necessary component of roaming between two or more public land mobile \nnetwork s (PLMN )s. \n3GPP specifications offer an interconnection solution bas ed on the Security Edge Protection Proxy \n(SEPP). All signaling traffic across and between operator networks MNOs is expected to transit \nthrough these security proxies.  \nThe SEPP mitigates attacks on the N32 interface by protecting 3GPP  control plane  message s \nbetween interconnecting MNOs. Security controls for protecting confidentiality and integrity for \nthe N32 include either TLS or Protocol for N32 Interconnect Security ( PRINS ). Additionally, 3GPP \nTS 33.501 specifies protection for the N32 interface in clau ses 13.1 and 13.2 .25 26 \nRecommended Controls and Mitigations for 3GPP Interconnect Security:  \n Transit the signaling traffic between MNOs through SEPPs.  \n Enable filtering of traffic coming from the interconnect with authentication between SEPPs.  \n Employ application layer security solution on the N32 interface between the SEPPs to \nprovide protection of sensitive data attributes while still allowing mediation services \nthroughout the interconnect.27 \nData Network ing  \nGiven the dynamic nature of the 5G  data network  interworking environment, and since the data \nnetwork  may not necessarily belong to the NSP or the NSC, there are various threat actors and \nassociated threats that  would have to be considered such as: misconfiguration and tampering \nattacks, pa ssive and active eavesdropping, spoofing, and signaling and user -plane flooding attacks \ncausing DoS.  \nExamples of tampering or misconfiguration attacks include : \n Replay of Domain Name System ( DNS ), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP ), or \nProtocol -Independent Multicast (PIM ) messages,  \n Tampering with NSSAI information carried between AAA Proxy ( AAA -P) and DN -AAA \nservers as part of the slice -specific authentication procedure , and  \n Tampering with authentication and authorization data carried within Extensible \nAuthentication Protocol (EAP ) messages, modification, and replaying slice -specific user \nplane  messages between data network  and UPF over N6.  \n \n25 REPORT ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING OPTIONAL SECURITY FEATURES THAT CAN DIMINISH THE \nEFFECTIVENESS OF 5G SECURITY, FCC CSRIC VII  \n26 3GPP TS 33.501  \n27 Additional resources for security framework, data models , and API s are  the MEF 117 SAS Service Attributes and \nService Framework ; MEF 118 Zero Trust Framework for MEF Services ; and MEF 128 LSO API Security Profile  \n\n\n34 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Passive and active eavesdropping co uld lead to information disclosure to un -authorized entities. \nExample of such attacks include subscriber info (e.g., SUPI, UE location, subscription info, and more \nimportantly slice info) leakage, as to who is using which slice may be leaked between slices  and to \nexternal entities. Such disclosures are possible if EAP messages are not protected. Additionally, \nleakage of sensitive network info to other slices ( customer or non -customer) or to external entities: \nLeakage of slice -specific network Information (e .g., routing information: DHCP, DNS messages). \nRemote Authentication Dial -In User Service (RADIUS)  and Diameter messages may also leak such \ninformation which can then be used by an attacker to target the N6 or the data network  network.  \n                               \nFigure 9: Reference Architecture for 5G Network Interworking28 \n \nMitigations to Facilitate Future Data Network Interworking Security  in the \nEarliest Stages of Design : \n1) Leve rage sandbox and test environments to model E2E  5G-to-external data network  \ninterworking, including leveraging native slicing specifications in other network types, \nVirtual Private Network (VPN)  and tunneling protocols, and Management and Orchestration \nframeworks to facilitate secure data network  interworking.   \n2) Engage in follow -on work through the ESF  or other suitable mechanism to develop more \ndetailed guidance for the rapidly evolving network slicing work of MEF, TMForum , GSMA \nand others to extend the capabilities of 3GPP/5G slicing into the broader global networking \nframeworks.   \n3) In requests for proposal and system design documents, requestors assess and specify full -\nE2E  connectivity requirements, including slice parameters and/or key 5G slice -defin ed QoS \nrequirements that are to  be maintained E2E  across non -5G environments ( e.g., security, \nphysical/logical separation, encryption, QoS, latency, etc.)  \n4) Network providers pre -negotiate internetworking agreements necessary to provide E2E  \nconnectivity acro ss the full geographic footprint where connectivity is needed.  \n \nRegardless of how data network  interworking is implemented, network design and deployment \nneed to  consider the threat environment at the N6 interface to ensure the confidentiality , integrity, \nand availability  triad of the overall information system.  \n \n28 3GPP TS 29.561 V17.5 figure 6 -1 \n\n\n35 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Recommended Mitigations to Counter the Risks Previously Described : \n Protect integrity and authenticity for all signaling  (e.g., Use DNSEC to protect DNS \nmessages. ) and control plane  messages.  \n Transport EAP messages carrying authentication and authorization data over secured \ntransport mechanisms that provide the confidentiality, integrity, and availability triad  as \nwell as  replay protection ( e.g., Diameter messages that are protected f or integrity and \nauthenticity) . \n Protect all policies and data associated with network slicing at the UPF for the N6 interface \nfrom tampering using data -at-rest integrity protection . \n Control human or machine access to the N6 configuration on the UPF by leveraging an IAM \nsystem that uses granular access control . Such controls include attribute -based access \ncontrol or  using multi -factor authentication for humans.  \n Protect the user plane  traffic dedicated to a customer  slice at the IP layer for integrity and \nconfidentiality. Recommend  using IPSec between  the UPF to the customer  network in an \nE2E  manner. In some cases, the protection may be done in a hop -by-hop fashion.  \n Instantiation of a customer  dedicated  N6 interface associated may be reside on a shared \nUPF or on a dedicated UPF for customer . \n Use mutual authentication for communication between the AAA -S / DN -AAA and the \nNSSAA and SMF respectively , by means of  X.509 certificates that have been issued by a \nmutually trust ed certificate authority. Similarly, use mutual authentications  for all \ncommunications between the SMF and the DHCP servers over the N6 using X.509v3 \ncertificates . \n Each instance of the N6 interface at the UPF that is dedicated to a slice shall have the  \ncapability to rate -limit and firewall user traffic per slice based on  current  policies.  \n  For each network slice, support rate -limited signaling / control plane  messages for each N6 \ninterface used to communicate to DN -AAA, DNS, DHCP servers etc.  \nManagement and  Orchestration  \nA very highly sought -after target for compromising  a 5G network slice is attacking the MANO \nsystem. This is because the  design, deployment, a nd operation of the slice will be done by the \nmanagement platform, mostly via IaC, programmed automation playbooks, and orchestration of \nfunctions . Commandeering the MANO system  enable s the ability to introduc e security \nconfiguration vulnerabilities that a ttackers can use to compromise the integrity of the network \nslice. The threats encompass unauthorized modifications of the playbooks, compromised software \nsupply chain s, alteration s of the IaC scripts  physical network function (PNF) and VNF ( xNF ) images . \nThe set of security controls required to protect the MANO system are the same as protection of an \napplication, guidance can be found in NIST publications such as:  \n NIST 800 -53 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations  \n NIST 800 190  Application Container Security Guide  \n \nIn addition, ensure that the security controls are tailored towards the specific needs of the NOP  \nsystem - such as the API security system - consider  the structure of the APIs as defined by 3GPP and \n\n\n36 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   TMF in evaluating attacks against them.  \nEnsure that only authorized entities (humans and machines) have the capability to modify or \nupdate slice characteristics. The authorized entities need to  be granular  and different for each of \nthe processes (ex: slice design, activation, etc.) associated with the slice lifecycle . \nNetwork Slice Creation  and Deployment  \nThe requirements specified by a network slice at inception are expected to be met throughout its \nlifecy cle. Network cyber -attacks need to  be considered. These potential vulnerabilities include \ntraffic injection attacks, impersonation attacks, and DoS attacks, including exhaustion of resources.  \nMore specifically to roaming scenarios, new vectors of attack r elated to interconnect can arise \nespecially considering management and orchestration across different administrative domains.  \nSlicing across domains will most likely use heterogeneous platforms and solutions: slicing \ncomponents can be implemented in firmw are, operating system kernel level, in the virtualization \nsoftware systems or even in regular software. In this wide spectrum of environments, the slicing \ncomponents may be provided by different vendors thereby making difficult a common level of \nsecurity f or a network slice.  \nSince roaming requires additional interconnect interfaces, these can be used as attack points and \nexpose vulnerabilities between slices and services.  \nThe threats covered here focus primarily on newer threats related to NFV  with a focus  on slicing. \nThreats relating to the infrastructure, e.g., cloud infrastructure, or generic 5G system threats  or \ngeneric threats relating to trust enabling functions  and services, ( e.g., time service, NTP, DNS, DHCP \netc.), are not addressed in this documen t. \nRegardless of which frameworks ( e.g., MANO, ONAP) are used, the threats described here are \napplicable to the service and slice design and deployment infrastructure , and ought to  be mitigated \nto ensure the confidentiality , integrity, and availability  triad of the overall information system. \nSome of the key  threats that would have  to be addressed include, un -authorized access and \nelevation of privileges.  \nA threat actor gains access and elevates privileges and thus on -boards a malicious net work slice \ncontaining malicious VNFs that will attack the NFs of other tenants. A threat actor could perform an \nun-authorized request for reservation of compute, store,  and network resources  (e.g., using the Or -\nVi or Vnfm -Vi interface ). The impact could be  network slice SLA and service degradation to \nlegitimate slices.  \nA threat actor attacking a weak RBAC mechanism or exploiting a vulnerability on the system can \nallow the threat actor to further deploy malicious code into the telec ommunications  environment  \nby modifying the deployment patterns. The OSS/BSS system may be used (e.g., using the Os -Ma \ninterface ) by an attacker to gain privilege s to modify slice design  and orchestration /activation of \nthe slice and associated NFs, and modify changes to slice connections  (e.g., modifications to service \nchaining).  \nAnother class of attack that must be addressed as a high priority includes tampering. An attacker \nmay tamper with policy registries ( e.g., authorization policies), VNF or CNF packages and artifacts, \nmodification of affinity and anti -affinity rules, VNF ins tance information, VNF  / CNF  attestation \n\n37 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   data, etc.  \nSpoofing of user or machine identities attacks using password /private key  stealing, or Man -in-the-\nMiddle (MITM) may allow the impersonator to conduct activities in deploying malicious code into \nthe telec ommunications  environment using the OSS/BSS, NFVO, VNFM or VIM/CISM. An attacker \ncould also spoof the URL of a legitimate repository from where the orchestrator is expected to pull \nimages.  \nTo Counter the Above Threats, and Ensure Network Slices Are Designe d and \nDeployed in a Secure Manner, Recommended Security Mitigations Include : \n \n1) A centralized identity management system that is part of the NSPs PKI system, which is \ncapable of issuing and managing X.509v3 certificates to the various orchestration \ncomponen ts (MANO or ONAP functions). The certificates are then used for mutual \nauthentication between the different components before service requests can be processed . \n2) Granular attribute and role -based access  control (RBAC) that limits access to a resource by \nscope and duration and the type of actions (e.g ., Create, Read, Update , and Delete \n[CRUD ] operations) that can be performed.  \n3) Ensure that the authenticity - that every artifact is from a trusted vendor - and integrity of the \npackages an d artifacts are maintained throughout the life cycle of the xNF. Another class of \nattack that must be addressed as a high priority includes tampering. An attacker may \ntamper with policy registries ( e.g., authorization policies), VNF or CNF packages and \nartifacts, modification of affinity and anti -affinity rules, VNF instance information, VNF  / \nCNF  attestation data, etc.   \n4) Finally , ensure that the NSP certifies the VNF packages do not contain any known \nvulnerabilities once the package has been on -boarded by r unning security scans.  \nAdditionally secure supply -chain requirements may need to be adhered to by the NSP.  \n \nThe security features listed above , and using zero -trust framework , would help mitigate attacks on \non-boarding and instantiation of the network sl ices.   \nNetwork slice design and deployment across networks will rely on defined standardized slice types \n(in 3GPP) and the GSMA -defined Generic Slice Template (NEST). End to end inter -operator design \nand deployment of slices is currently  unlikely with roam ing and interconnect relying mostly on \nSLA s between operators. This is in part because one MNOs network management cannot be \nimposed on another MNOs operations. Particularly challenging is in the case of local breakout for \nslice orchestration as both the  home and the visited networks are involved.  \nOrchestration of a slice will require service agreements to be in place between transport, \nRAN/core, and slice providers in advance of a service request. Coordinated management is \nessential between the RAN/core , interconnection, and the transport domains to ensure the E2E \nSLAs, which may include cross -domain orchestration. In addition to that, transport and mobile \nnetwork capabilities are expected to  be harmonized to ensure that mobile network capabilities are \nnot compromised by limitations in the transport network.  \n \n \n\n\n38 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Network Slice Isolation and Segregation Recommendations :  \n Logical isolation and performance isolation between network slices . \n Physical isolation of physical resources for network slices, and separate management \nsystems and administrators will be required to meet high confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability triad requirements.  \n Data plane on one  slice ought  not influence other network slices.   \n Control plane  actions ( e.g., creation/update/deletion) have no influence on other slices.  \n \nETSI recognized that l eakage of data between network slices as a significant problem . To avoid \nleakage or breach issues between network slices, it is recommended  that any implementation \nprovide risk mitigation from attacks from one slice to another.  \nNetwork Slice Implementation Recommendations:  \n Usage -specific security policies regarding au thentication and authorization requirements \n(e.g., IoT vs. mobile broadband user) must  be configurable.  \n Slice -specific authentication that is performed over and above the 3GPP primary \nauthentication is carried out to meet customer  user authentication requirements.  \n Network Slice and the provider take into consideration  privacy of user information and \ndevice identifiers, including following regulations like Customer Proprietary Network \nInformation  (CPNI ).29 \n Confidentiality must  be considered for network slice  selection information when sent over \nthe RAN .  \n Isolation of network traffic ought to  be maintained  when a common control plane between \ndifferent network slices is used.  \n Security of sensitive shared network elements , such as the UDR that stores subscriber \nprofiles , needs to  be secured  and actively monitored.  \n \n  \n \n29 Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), June 9 2008, https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA -\n08-132 1A1.pdf  \n\n\n39 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE CRITERIA  \nIntroduction   \n \n5G n etwork slicing add s complexity to a network. While there are standards defining specifications \nfor how operators build their 5G networks, there are no clear specifications for how network \noperators and slice providers develop, implement, and maintain security for network sli cing.  \nDuring operations and maintenance, improper NS configuration s and management may present an \nopportunity for malicious actors to access data from different slices that they otherwise do not \nhave access to, or to deny access to authorized slice users.  This is the reason authentication and \nattribute -based access control s (ABAC) are fundamental to a network slice .  \nDefinition of Operations and Maintenance   \n \nWhen a systems engineer fields a system, it enters the Operations Phase. Operati ng a  5G network \ntypically involves day -to-day operational and management activities, including (but not limited to) \nscaling in/out based on service assurance, health monitoring , security scans, etc.  \nMaintenance refers to the general upkeep of the network slices. Preventive maintenance is a \nschedule of planned actions aimed at preventing breakdowns and failures before they occur and at \npreserving and enhancing equipment reliabili ty by replacing worn components before they fail. \nPreventive maintenance for a 5G network slicing might include software patching and periodic \nupdates.  \nOperations and maintenance (O&M) involve  monitoring  configuration, fault, and performance \nmanagement by humans, or by automation. To ensure security , all intra -datacenter \ncommunications must use standards -based and approved encryption , and be mutually \nauthenticated  security  (e.g., mutual TLS or IP sec) to ensure confidentiality , integrity, and \navailability . \nImportance of Operations and  Maintenance  \nFor 5G network service providers, the O&M phase include s activation, supervision, reporting, \ndeactivation, and modification activities. Each network slice may have unique SLRs. The actions of \noperators and O&M tools must assure that those requirements are met. These  need robust O&M \ntools, processes, and capabilities. For example, maintaining the integrity of the O&M platforms is \nextremely critical and therefore their trust -enabling functions ( e.g., PKI authorization s erver) need \nto be always validated for integrity leveraging hardware roots -of-trust and remote attestation . \nBackwards compatibility or at least co -existence of multi -mode network elements from previous \ngenerations also poses architectural challenges to 5G operators. These complex structural \nproblems are exacerbated in roaming situations , or in use cases that involve multi -operators \nworking together. Additionally, network slice  providers work with the vendor of VNF packages, \nplatform softwar e vendors etc. to ensure that the authenticity (ensuring every artifact is from a \ntrusted vendor) . Each NSP must assure the integrity of each  package is maintained throughout the \nlife cycle of the VNF. To achieve this the NSP and  the vendors need to  agree on a trust model that \neither uses third -party CA or  the NSPs PKI system. Also, the NSP needs to  certify that the VNF \n\n40 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   package does not contain any known vulnerabilities once the package has been on -boarded by \nrunning security scans . \nEffective O&M solutions  strike a delicate balance between cost, performance,  and \nfunctionality /security . Techniques to meet this objective include centralized monitoring, fault root \ncause analysis, performance data analysis, automatic O&M controls, etc.  \nBasic 5G  network performance assurance capabilities require network/user behavioral \nvisualization, fault demarcation/isolation , and self -diagnosis capabilities. NSP provides  service \nassurance to key performance indicators  and visibility to their customers. For exa mple , customers \ncan clearly know the details on both security and service assurances that the slice provides. \nDetailed logs on performance, faults, and security events could be  provided to authorized customer \npersonnel or machines. Based on measurements, t he service assurance platform ( e.g., using \nArtificial  Intelligence/Machine Learning  (AI/ML )) can tailor the service and security assurances to \nmatch the SLR.  \nOrchestratio n of Network Slices  \nPolicy Considerations   \nEach network slice operates on a specific tracking area associated with a collection of logical 5G \nradio nodes (gNBs) and the associated set of Access and Mobility Management functions. \nEmblematic  transport data plane technologies include IP, VPN, and Virtual Local Area Network  \n(VLAN ). It is paramount that the collection of 5G technologies comply with  organization security \npolicy. Additionally, E2E QoS requirements need to  be supported within the slices designated \ndeployment area; in practice, the E2E QoS uniquely define the combination of  the QoS in the RAN \nand the QoS in the 5G Core for a given network slice use case.  \nWorkflow Considerations   \nComplex workflows might be required to handle a network slicing request. One example is the \nprovisioning of transport specific resources. Provisioni ng can involve intelligent and dynamic \ntuning of QoS, and intelligent admission control to determine available resources.   Resources \ninvolved might belong to the RAN, the 5G Core, or both.  \nMaintenance of Network Slices  \nMaintenance of a network slice includ es assuring that all SLRs  are met. Service assurance includes \nresource management and making sure SLRs  and policies (internal or intra -operator) are met. \nOnce a network slice has been created and configured to meet certain SLRs , it needs to be \nmonitored and maintained over time as threats continue to evolve.  \nMonitoring  \nIt is expected that network monitorin g covers all SLRs specified by associated network slice service \nprofiles, including the operational state of each hardware and software component of a network \nslice. Monitoring the usage of a network slice is not limited to fraud detection, revenue assuran ce, \nor device behavior analysis for obvious network impacts, e.g., DoS signaling storm or user traffic \nsaturation. Monitoring can be used by the system to protect itself from an attacker that may gain \n\n41 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   access directly to that system.  \nIt is important to iden tify where the security monitoring interfaces are within the 5G ecosystem. \nThis is especially important in multi -vendor implementations where functionality from different \nsources might be deployed.  \nTable 7 describes recommendations for typical types of mobile network monitoring activities . For \nexample,  in NIST 5G Cybersecurity, it highlights the value of having good visibility across the 5G \ninfrastructure; consequently, there is a need to continuously monitor communications patterns, see \nthreats within the  extended network, and detect and respond to threats using methods such as \nbehavioral modeling , supervised  machine learning,  and unsupervised machine learning .34 \nThe reference materials in Table 7 contain various attributes needed  to maintain consistency a nd \nreliability of each network slice. Implementations provide timely and efficient access that \ninformation.  \nTable 7:  \nExamples of Network Monitoring Activities for 5G Networks  \nTypes of Network Monitoring  Explanation  \nPerformance Management  Due to the complex nature of mobile networks and vendors \ndiversity of hosting platforms, a unique overarching \nperformance management technique across different networks \nand vendors is required  \nQuality of Service  5G QoS include network performance metrics ( e.g., latency, \nthroughput, etc.) but might also include availability, reliability, \naccessibility, retainability, etc.  \nNIST 5G Cybersecurity  NIST SP1800 -33B provides examples of 5G standard features \nand third -party secu rity controls for successful 5G \nimplementations.  \nControl Plane \nCommunication  Control plane communication is not only protected for privacy \nbut also protected against attackers malicious modifications, \nperformance issues, and anomalous behaviors.  \nUser -Plane Communication  This is the communication which connects the actual data \ncoming over the RAN to the Internet which is helpful to detect \nacceptable use violations e.g., a DDoS attack, DNS tunneling, \nspoofing, etc.  \nAnomaly Detection  Ano maly detection is a capability of identifying unusual \nactivities or behaviors in networks. A variety of sensors, \nfiltering and advanced ( e.g., AI/ML -based) security analytics are \nnecessary to detect sophisticated and zero -day threats.  \n \nTo conduct O&M acti vities successfully, the service requirements  as defined by a network slice \nprofile need to be monitored. As noted in the Figure 10 above, monitoring a network slice can \neither be functional  monitoring  and/or  security monitoring.  \nTypically, functional moni toring is already provided by the equipment CORE, RAN, and that \nelement manager assuming the network is operating in a healthy state. It is paramount that \nsecurity monitoring is built with zero -trust tenets  in mind. Hence, monitoring solutions from the \nprevious generations need to be integrated or updated to include 5G specific features. Otherwise, \n\n42 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   carriers will have to build a standalone separate monitoring capability to support 5G O&M . \nIn the federated roaming scenarios, where slices are traversed into another carrier network , SLA \nneeds to  be established before deployment; a common methodology of monitoring and security \nmitigation schemes needs to  be present at the gateways or logical borders between carriers.  \nMonitoring incorporates the c ollected data from various sources in the 5G networks. The acquired \ndata will be analyzed first to see what insights and conclusions may be drawn. The analysis is \nfollowed by alerting, visualizing, and reporting. These steps are discussed in the following clauses . \nAlerting  \nAlert capability is an important management tool. It is recommended  that any alerting program \nsupport the ability to subscribe to user specified asynchronous alert messages.  Alerts can notify a \ncyber protection team (CPT) or network operators of unusual activities and possible cyber events.  \nAlerts can be used in conjunction with Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) for correlating \ncyber events . For example,  periodic UE a nd network scanning can identify anomalous behavior that \nshows malicious code has compromised certain 5G network element. For example, this may trigger  \nan alert to the security orchestration, automation,  and response (SOAR) platform, which instructs  \nthe ne twork monitoring system (NMS) to disconnect the UE and prevent it from registering to the \nnetwork  until the malicious code has been removed from the UE.  \nIn this simple example, SIEM supports threat detection, compliance , and security incident \nmanagement th rough the collection and analysis (both near real time and historical) of security \nevents, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources30.  A SIEM cannot \naddress  alerts  by themselves , and will not mitigate any threats directly ; however, having them \nallow s CPT and operators to respond quickly and efficiently. Together, they provide CPT and cyber \noperations near -real-time benefits, deep insights over time -based data analysis, and underlying \nsupport for cybersecurity visua lizations and dashboards . \nReporting  \nReporting functionality include s providing status of updates, metrics that can be used to assure \nthat an installation is correct, and metrics that can be used to detect potential issues. The reporting \ncan include a  summa ry of network slice health status and overview . \nReporting and storage of past historical data are both important in O&M ; they provide \ntroubleshooters the ability to review and later analyze a problem. For example,  cyber forensics and \nanomaly detection , at both the network level and user behavioral level , rely on past reports and \nhistorical data. Summary r eports can be periodic ally generated for management, but the se would \nbe different than reports required by  maintenance personnel , as reports  for maintenanc e \npersonnel  need to  be comprehensive to encompass all relevant technical details and be in a \nreadable format . \n \n \n \n30 https://www.gartner.com/en/information -technology/glossary/security -information -and-event -management -siem  \n\n43 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Conclusion  \n5G SA network  slicing  is poised  to become  a key technology  feature  within  5G, so it is imperative  \nwe understand  potential  security  threats  to 5G network  slicing . Hence,  it is important  to recognize  \nindustry -recognized  best -practices  of how  5G network  slicing can be implemented,  designed,  \ndeployed,  operated,  maintained , potential ly harden ed, and mitigated  as they  affect  QoS  and \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability triad SLAs.  The goal  is to promote  collaboration  amongst  \nMNOs,  hardware  manufacturers,  software  developers,  other  non -MNOs,  systems  integrators,  and \nnetwork  slice  customers,  in order  to facilitate  increased  resiliency  and security  hardening  within  \n5G network  slicing.  \n \n\n44 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   APPENDIX: Abbreviated Terms  \nAcronym  Meaning  \n3GPP  Third Generation Partnership Project  \n5G Fifth Generation Cellular Network  \n5G-AKA  5G Authentication and Key Agreement  \n5GC  5G Core Network  \n5GS  5G System  \n5G SA  5G Standalone  Cellular Network  \n5QI 5G QoS Identifier  \nAAA  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting [Server]  \nABAC  Attribute -based Access Controls  \nAF Application Function  \nAI/ML  Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning  \nAMF  Access Management Function  \nAPI Application Programming Interface  \nAPN  Access Point Name  \nAPRF  Authentication Credential Repository Processing Function  \nCIA Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability  \nCIR Container Image Registry  \nCISA  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  \nCISM  Container Infrastructure Service Management  \nCP Control Plane  \nCRUD  Create, Read, Update and Delete  \nCPT  Cyber Protection Team  \nCSMF  Communication Service Management Function  \nCU Central Unit  \nCUPS  Control and User Plane Function Separation  \nDDoS  Distributed Denial of Service  \nDHCP  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  \nDN Data Network  \nDNN  Data Network Name  \nDNS  Domain Name Service  \nDoS  Denial of Service  \nDU Distributed Unit  \nE2E  End -to-End  \nEAP  Extensible Authentication Protocol  \neMBB  Enhanced Mobile Broadband  \nEPC  Evolved Packet Core  \nESF Enduring Security Framework  \nEAP -AKA  Extensible Authentication Protocol Authentication and Key Agreement Prime  \nGSMA  GSM Association  \nHPLMN  Home Public Land Mobile Network  \nIaC Infrastructure as Code  \nIAM  Identity & Access Management  \nIETF  Internet Engineering Task Force  \nIoT Internet of Things  \n\n45 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Acronym  Meaning  \nIPsec  Internet Protocol Security  \nIPX IP Packet eXchange  \nMANO  Management and Network Orchestration  \nMDM  Mobile Device Management  \nMEF  (Formally known as the) Metro Ethernet Forum  \nMIMO  Multiple -input/Multiple -output  \nMITM  Man in The Middle  \nNEST  Network Slice Template  \nNAS  Non -access Stratum  \nRBAC  Role -based Access Control  \nNF Network Function  \nNFV  Network Function Virtualization  \nNFVO  Network Functions Virtualization Orchestrator  \nNIST  National Institute of Standards and Technology (US DOC)  \nnon-RT RIC  Non -Real -Time RAN Intelligence Controller  \nNRF  Network Resource Function  \nNSACF  Network Slice Admission Control Function  \nNSP  Network Slice  Provider  \nNSSAAF  Network Slice -Specific Authentication and Authorization Function  \nNSSAI  Network Slice Selection Assistance Information  \nNSSF  Network Slice Selection Function  \nNSSMF  Network Slice Subnet Management Function  \nO&M  Operations and Maintenance  \nOAuth  Open Authorization  \nONAP  Open Network Automation Platform  \nOSS-BSS Operations Support System - Business Support System  \nPCF  Policy Control Function  \nPDCP  Packet Data Convergence Protocol  \nPDU  Protocol Data Unit  \nPLMN  Public Land Mobile Networks  \nPLMP  Public Mobile Network  \nPNF  Physical Network Function  \nQoS  Quality of Service  \nRADIUS  Remote Authentication Dial -In User Service  \nRAN  Radio Access Network  \nRBAC  Role -based Access Control  \nRSD  Route Selection Descriptor  \nRU Radio Unit  \nSBI Service -Based Interface  \nSDN -C Software Defined Network Controller  \nSDO  Standards Development Organization  \nSEPP  Security Edge Protection Proxy  \nSIEM  Security Incident Event Management  \nSLR  Service Level Requirement  \nSMF  Session Management Function  \nSMO  Service Management and Orchestration [Framework]  \nSOAR  Security Orchestration Automation and Response  \n\n46 \n \nTLP: CLEAR   Acronym  Meaning  \nTD Traffic Descriptor  \nTLS Transport Layer Security  \nTN Transport Network  \nUDM  Unified Data Management  \nUDR  Unified Data Repository  \nUE User Equipment  \nUICC  Universal Integrated Circuit Card  \nUP User Plane  \nUPF  User Plane Function  \nURSP  User Equipment Route Selection Policy  \nVIM  Virtual Infrastructure Manager  \nVLAN  Virtual Local Area Network  \nVNF  Virtual Network Function  \nVNFD  VNF Descriptor  \nVNFM  Virtual Network Function Manager  \nVPN  Virtual Private Network  \nZTA  Zero Trust Architecture  \n\n47 \n \nTLP: CLEAR    \n\n",
