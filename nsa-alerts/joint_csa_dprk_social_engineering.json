North \nKorea ) state -sponsored cyber actors to enable computer network exploitation (CNE) globally against \nindividuals employed by research centers and think tanks, academic institutions, and news media \norganizations . These North Korean cyber actors are known to conduct spearphishing campaigns \nposing as  real journalists, academics, or other individuals with credible links to North Korean  policy \ncircles. The DPRK employs  social engineering to collect intellig ence on geopolitical events, foreign \npolicy strategies, and diplomatic efforts affecting its interests by gaining illicit access to the private \ndocuments, research, and communications of their targets.   \n \nBACKGROUND  \nNorth Koreas  cyber program provides the regime with broad intelligence collect ion and espionage \ncapabilities. The Governments of the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK  a.k.a. South \nKorea ) have observed sustained information -gathering efforts originating from  these North Korean \ncyber actors. North Koreas primary military intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General \nBureau (RGB), which has been sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council, is primarily \nresponsible for this network of actors and a ctivities.   \nWe assess  the primary goals of the DPRK regimes cyber program include maintaining consistent \naccess to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea , and other countries  of interest  to \nimpede any political, military, or economic t hreat to the regimes security and stability.  \nCurrently, the U.S. and ROK  Governments , and private sector cyber security companies , track a \nspecific set of DPRK cyber actors conducting  these  large -scale social engineering campaigns  as \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 2 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  Kimsuky, Thallium , APT43, Velvet Chollima, and Black Banshee . Kimsuky is administratively \nsubordinate to an element within North Koreas RGB  and has conducted broad cyber campaigns in \nsupport of RGB objectives since at least 2012. Kimsuky actors  primary mission is  to provide stolen \ndata and valuable geopolitical insight to the North Korean regime.   \nSome targeted entities may discount the threat posed by these social engineering campaigns, either \nbecause they do not perceive their research and communications as sensitive in nat ure, or because \nthey are not aware of how these  efforts fuel the regimes broader cyber espionage efforts. However, \nas outlined in this advisory , North Korea relies heavily on intelligence gained by compromising policy \nanalysts. Further, successful compromises enable Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective \nspearphishing emails that can be leveraged against more sensitive, high er-value ta rgets. The \nauthoring agencies believe that raising awareness of some of these campaigns and employing basic \ncyber security practices may frustrate the effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. This \nadvisory provides detailed information on how Kim suky actors operate; red flags to consider as you \nencounter common themes and campaigns; and general mitigation measures for entities  worldwide  to \nimplement to better protect against Kimsukys CNE operations.  \n \nIf you believe you have been targeted in one  of these spearphishing campaigns, whether or not \nit resulted in a compromise (particularly if you are a member of one of the targeted sectors), \nplease file a report with www.ic3.gov  and reference #KimsukyCSA in the inc ident description.   \nPlease include as much detail as you can about the incident including the sender email address \nand the text of the email message, specifying any links/URLs/domains.  Please specify whether \nyou responded to the email, clicked on any lin ks, or opened any attachments.  Please retain the \noriginal email and attachments in case you are contacted by an investigator for further \ninformation.   \n Please visit  www.ic3.gov  and use  #KimsukyCSA in your submission.  \n The U.S. Government also encourages victims to report suspicious activiti es, including any \nsuspected DPRK  cyber activities, to local FBI field offices.  \n For the ROK government, you can report suspicious activities to the National Intelligence \nService (www.n is.go.kr, 111), the National Police Agency (ecrm.police.go.kr, 182), or the Korea \nInternet & Security Agency (boho.or.kr, 118)  \n  \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 3 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  KIMSUKY  OPERATIONS : SOCIAL  ENGINEERING   \nIn a cybersecurity context, social engineering is a broad term referring to the use of deception to \nexploit human error and manipulate a target into unwittingly exposing  confidential or sensitive \ninformation for fraudulent purposes. DPRK cyber actors emplo y social engineering techniques to \nenable much of Pyongyangs malicious CNE. Among social engineering techniques, Kimsuky actors \nuse spearphishing or the use of fabricated emails and digital communications tailored to deceive a \ntarget as one of their prima ry vectors for initiating a compromise and gaining access into a targets \ndevices and networks. For over a decade, Kimsuky actors have continued to refine their social \nengineering techniques and made their spearphishing efforts increasingly difficult to di scern.  \nA Kimsuky spearphishing \ncampaign begins with \nbroad research and \npreparation. DPRK cyber \nactors often use  open -\nsource information to \nidentify potential targets of \nvalue and then tailor their \nonline personas to appear \nmore realistic and \nappealing to their victims.  \nThe Kimsuky actors will \ncreate email addresses \nthat resemble  email \naddresses of real \nindividuals they seek to \nimpersonate and generate \ndomains that host the \nmalicious content of a spearphishing message. DPRK actors often use domains that resemble \ncommon internet services and media sites  to deceive a target.  \n For example, Kimsuky actors are known to impersonate well -known news outlets and \njournalists using a domain such as @XYZkoreas.news spoofing a real news station while \nactual emails from the news serv ice appear as @XYZnews.com.  \n DPRK cyber actors commonly take on the identities of real people to gain trust and establish \nrapport in their digital communications. Kimsuky actors may have previously compromised the \nemail accounts of the person whom they a re impersonating. This allows the actors to search \nfor targets while scanning through compromised emails, with a particular focus on work -\nrelated files and personal information pertaining to retirees, social clubs, and contact lists. \nThey craft convincing spear phishing emails by repurposing the persons email signature,  \ncontact list, and past email exchanges. DPRK cyber actors are also known to compromise  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSample of a program for generating DPRK spearphishing emails . \nSubject  Recipient Address  Sender Address  Sender Name  \nDate and Time  \nDestination Link  \nCreator Name  Caution: Check input settings for errors.  Input Settings  Set specific input.  \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 4 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  email account s belonging to foreign policy expert s and subsequently creat e a secondary email \naccount , using the email account and identity of the expert to communicate with other \nsignificant targets.  \n In other cases, a Kimsuky actor will use multiple personas to engage a target; one persona to \nconduct initial outreach and a second persona to follow -up on th e first engagement to distract \na potential victim from discerning the identity of the original persona. Another tactic is to \nresend or forward an email from a source trusted by a target.  \n The initial phishing email occasionally contains a malicious lin k or document, often purporting \nto be a report or news article. These attached malicious documents are frequently password -\nprotected, which helps them evade detection by antivirus software and other security \nmeasures. However, more often, the initial spear phishing email does not contain any \nmalicious links or attachments and is instead intended to gain the trust of the victim.  \n Once DPRK cyber actors establish engagement with a target, the actors attempt to \ncompromise the account, device, or network belongi ng to the target by pushing malicious \ncontent in the form of a malicious macro embedded within a text document. This document is \neither attached directly to the email, or stored in a file hosting service, such as Google Drive or \nMicrosoft OneDrive. These m alicious macros, when enabled, quietly establish connections \nwith Kimsuky command and control infrastructure, and result in the provision of access to the \ntargets device.  \n In some cases, Kimsuky actors have developed spoofed or fake but realistic version s of \nactual websites, portals, or mobile applications, and directed targets to input credentials and \nother information that are harvested by the DPRK. Compromise of a target account can lead \nto persistent access to a victims communications , often through a malware used by Kimsuky \nactors called BabyShark . Kimsuky  actors have also been known to configure a victims email \naccount to quietly auto -forward all emails to another a ctor-controlled email.  \nNotably, victim responses to spearphishing lures also provide Pyongyang with the added benefit of \ninsight into foreign policy circles. This covert collection against the community of DPRK watchers is \nprobably of high value to the Kim  regime and provides another channel of information on top of what it \ngains through computer network operations.  \nAlthough all DPRK advanced persistent threat groups employ social engineering techniques, the \ncampaigns and themes described in this advisory a re specific to Kimsuky.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 5 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  RED FLAG INDICATORS  \nSector targets  should be aware of the following activity that may be indications or behaviors of \nmalicious DPRK cyber actors . \n Initial communications are  often  seemingly innocuous with no malicious links/attachments; \nfollow -on communications usually  contain malicious links/documents to facilitate exploitation \nof a computer or network.  \n Email content may include real text of messages recovered from previous victim  engagement \nwith other legitimate contacts.  \n Emails in English may sometimes have awkward sentence structure and/or incorrect \ngrammar.  \n Email content may contain a distinct Korean dialect exclusively used in North Korea.  \n Victims/targets with both direct and indirect knowledge of policy information i.e., U.S. and ROK \ngovernment employees/officials working  on North Korea, Asia, China, Southeast  Asia matters; \nU.S. and ROK government employees with high clearance  levels; and members of the \nmilitary, are approache d with common themes and questions as referenced in this advisory.  \n Email domains look like a legitimate news media site, but do not match the domain of the \ncompanys official website. The domains also may be identified as such in open -source \nmalware reposi tories like Virus Total.  \n Spoofed email accounts have subtle incorrect misspellings of the names and email addresses \nof the legitimate ones listed in a university directory or an official website.  \n Malicious documents require the user to click Enable Macros  to view the document.  \n Actors are persistent if the target does not respond to the initial spearphishing email. They will \nlikely send a follow -up email within 2 -3 days of initial contact.  \n Emails purporting to be from official sources but sent using unoff icial email  services . \n  \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 6 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  CAMPAIGNS AND THEMES  \nKimsuky cyber actors craft their spearphishing campaigns around themes characterizing the target, \nmessage content, and the malicious mechanism, or lure, through which a compromise is initiated. \nThe main themes t o beware of are impersonations and targeting of journalists , academic scholars , \nand think tank researchers  to:  \n solicit responses to foreign policy -related inquiries,  \n conduct a survey,  \n request an interview,  \n review a document,  \n request a resume, or  \n offer pa yment for authoring a research paper.  \nKimsuky actors tailor their themes to their targets interests and will update their content to reflect \ncurrent events discussed among the community of North Korea watchers.  \nThe following are examples of real Kimsuky spearphishing attempts that illustrate variations of the \ncommon themes. In some instances, the cyber actor poses as a journalist and targets a think tank \nresearcher , while at other times, the DPRK actor may take on the persona of an academic scholar to \ntarget other scholars virtually every combination of these themes and lures has been previously \nobserved .  \n1. Impersonation of journalists  \nKimsuky actors often spoof real journalists and broadcast writers to craft a credible front and make \ninquiries to prominent  individuals working North Korea matters. Usually, the questions will revolve \naround current events and whether U .S. experts believe North Korea will re -join talks with the U .S., \nwhether they believe North Korea will resume testing its missiles, and how th ey see China \nresponding. In many instances, Kimsuky actors do not attach malware to their initial email. Instead, \nthey first send an introductory email to inquire about interview opportunities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA  TLP: CLEAR  \nPage 7 of 21  | Product ID : CSA-20230601 -1 \nTLP: CLEAR  Sample email communication 1 :  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollow -on email : If the targets agree to the interview, the actors will then follow up with a second \nemail containing malicious content . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, we have seen Kimsuky actors spoof legitimate jour nalists to specifically target think t ank \nemployees . Kimsuky actors commonly pose questions in their spearphishing emails about current \nevents, such as issues regar ding Russia s invasion of Ukraine ; U.S.-DPRK relations ; DPRK nuclear \nand security topics ; policymaker  stance s on the Asian region; and thoughts on current China -North \nKorea and Russia -North Korea relations.

Many believe a recent absence of North Korean \nprovocations is due to Pyongyangs decision not to hurt Olympic vibes held in its lone \nmajor ally,  but with the Games in the books, speculation is growing that North Korea \nis likely to pick up where it left off in January, or a series of missile tests.  \n-Do you believe North Korea will resume testing its missile launches? If so, when is \nthe best time f or it and what kind of missiles it will opt?  \n-China is scheduled to hold the National Peoples Congress, and the Chinese \nPeoples Political Consultative Conference from March 4 to 13 and do you think the \nschedule will further defer North Koreas possible missile testing?  \n-North Korea has indicated that it will lift its moratorium on missile and nuclear tests, \nbut do you think there is the possibility that Pyongyang will offer to talk with the U.S., \nputting the moratorium on the line? If so, what would be the U.S. response?

I am \nsending e -mail to you because I would like to hear your opinions about how Russias \ninvasion of Ukraine will affect the situation surrounding North Korea. Would you like to give \nme your opinions about the questions below?  \n1) Some analysts argue tha t Russias invasion of Ukraine may make North Korea much \nmore reluctant to give up nuclear weapons, given that Ukraine has been eventually invaded \nby Russia after it abandoned its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees under \nthe Budapest Memor andum. This certainly looks similar to an agreement made between \nTrump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in 2018. What do you think about this kind of \nargument?  \n2) While the Biden administration is concentrated on the evolving circumstances surrounding \nUkraine , possibly lowering its guard in the Asia -Pacific region, North Korea Launches New \nICBM and may try to carry out nuclear tests. What do you think about North Koreas future \ndevelopments?  \n3) Do you think North Korea believes that Biden is already a lame d uck and sees this as a \ngood chance to concentrate on developing new weapons?  \n4) Do you expect China will tolerate North Koreas spate of ballistic missile launches and \npossible nuclear tests? Do you think North Korea can or will maintain stable and amica ble \nrelations with China? Does Russia not afford to care about North Korea?  \nI would be very grateful if you could send me your answers within 5 days.
