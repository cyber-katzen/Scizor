Vulnerabilities in \ndevice management and configura tions present weaknesses for a  malicious cyber actor to exploit in order to gain \npresence and maintain persistence within a  network. Adversaries have shifted  their focus from exclusively exploiting \ntraditional endpoints  to increasingly exploiting specialized and  embedded devices, including routers and switches. They \ndo this through manipulating weaknesses in configuration s, controlling routing protocols , and implanting malware in the \noperating systems . \nService Security Recommendations  \nAll networking devices, incl uding routers and switches, come equipped with services turned on when they are received \nfrom the manufacturer. Disabled services cannot be exploited by an adversary . Therefore, all unnecessary services \nshould be disabled. By default, each manufacturer tur ns off different services in their standard out -of-the-box \nconfiguration, and default services may vary among operating systems. Research should be done to determine what \nservices are running by default. The following guidance will serve to determine the s ervices that should be enabled or \ndisabled:  \nEnable  \n SSHv3 or TLS:  Both of these protocols are used to securely communicate to remote network devices.  \nDisable  \n Echo Protocol:  A legacy protocol to measure the round trip time of a packet . \n Chargen Protocol:  A legacy protocol that uses arbitrary characters to test, debug, and measure the connection . \n Discard Protocol:  A legacy protocol to simply discard received packets . \n Daytime Protocols:  Returns ASCII character strings of the current date and time . \n FTP Protocol : Allows users to copy files between their local system and any system that can be reached on the \nnetwork . \n Telnet:  An application layer clear text protocol used on the network to communicate with another device . \n BootP Service:  A legacy protocol used to assign an IP address  to a device .   \n HTTP Server:  Most devices come with a Web service enabled by default . \n SNMP Protocol:  A protocol to manage network devices. If needed, only run SNMPv3 with a Management \nInformation Base (MIB) allow list  (Reducing the risk of Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP Abuse 1) \nand do not use SNMP community strings . \n Discovery Protocols:  These protocols are used to share information with neighboring devices and discover the \nplatform of those devices . \n IP Source Routing:  Allows the sender to control the route of information to the destination . \n IP Unreachable:  Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) messages  can be used to map out the network \n                                            \n1 https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/library/ia -advisories -alerts/reducing -the-risk-of-snmp -abuse.cfm  \n\n \n \nU/OO/171339 -16 | PP-20-0702  | August 2020 Rev 1.1  2 \nNSA | Hardening Network Devices  \ntopology . \n IP Mask Reply:  Replies respond to ICMP mask requests  by sending out ICMP mask replies containi ng important \nnetwork information.  \n Zero Touch Provisioning:  Zero touch provisioning allows network devices to reach out to download firmware \nand configurations without any user interaction.  \nInterface and Switch Port  Recommendations  \nAs with services, all router interfaces and switch ports that are not used should be disabled to prevent unauthorized \naccess to the device.  \n Enable port security . \n Shut down unused interfaces  and switch ports.  \n Place unused switch ports in a  VLAN that is not routed and closely monitored. Reassign the native VLAN . \nDisable  \n Unused interfaces and routing protocols  \n IP direct -broadcast  \n IP proxy -arp \nSecure Access Recommendations  \nThere are several ways to access network devices: through an administra tive connection, console line, auxiliary line, and \nvirtual terminal connection. Each method should be secured to prevent any unauthorized access to the network device. \nThe following security configurations need to be implemented to limit and secure access to t he router or switch from the \nconsole, auxiliary, and Virtual Teletype ( VTY) ports:  \n Use multi -factor authentication using hardware tokens and passwords.  \n Use out -of-band management  to separate network administration traffic from normal user traffic . \n Implemen t the manufacturers configuration guidance to restrict access to the console port.  \n Limit the number of simultaneous management connections.  \n Enable the strongest password encryption supported by the equipment.  \n Follow Digital Identity Guidelines  Authenti cation and Lifecycle Management (NIST SP 800 -63B2). \n Reduce the risk of exposing administrative interfaces to user traffic by applying IP address access control lists.  \n Restrict physical access to routers/switches and apply access control lists for remote access.  \n Monitor and log all attempts to access network devices.  \n                                            \n2 https://pages.nist.gov/800 -63-3/sp800 -63b.html  \n\n \n \nU/OO/171339 -16 | PP-20-0702  | August 2020 Rev 1.1  3 \nNSA | Hardening Network Devices  \nVendors of network infrastructure devices often provide detailed documentation with security guidance for each of their \nproducts.  In addition to applying the above mitigations, it is also reco mmended to apply the security guidelines available \nthrough vendor publications.  \nGeneral Security Recommendations  \n Install the latest version of the network devices operating system and approved patches to protect from known \nvulnerabili ties to the vendors equipment.  \n All updated patches should be tested before implementing them on the enterprise to ensure operational network \nstability and legacy application s continue to work.  \n Create and enforce the Site Security Policy (SSP) to secure all devices. The SSP sh ould outline roles and \nresponsibilities to manage and monitor devices and services. Each role should only have the lowest privilege \naccess that is required to perform required tasks.  \n Back up configuration files and store them offline.  \n Never share configura tion files by using unsecure means, such as email, File Transfer Protocol ( FTP), or \npublishing them to a website. This could allow an adversary to gain insight into the enterprise architecture or \ndecrypt password hashes.   \n Disable unused services and imple ment an access control list to protect services that are required by the SSP.  \n Periodically test the security of the network devices and compare the configuration against the site SSP or original \nconfiguration to verify the configuration of all network equ ipment.  \n Compare the offline hash of the operating system against the hash of the vendors known good operating system \nimage to validate the integrity.  \n Safeguard configuration files with encryption and/or password protection when sending them electronicall y and \nwhen they are stored and backed up.  \nDisclaimer of Endorsement  \nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.
