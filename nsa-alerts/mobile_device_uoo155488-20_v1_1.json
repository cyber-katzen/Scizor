Users of mobile devices desire to take full advantage of the features \navailable on those devices, but many of the features provide convenience and capability but sacrifice security.

Even \nlegitimate senders can pass on \nmalicious content accidently \nor as a result of being \ncompromised or impersonated \nby a malicious actor.\nUnexpected pop-ups like this are \nusually malicious. If one appears, \nforcibly close all applications \n(i.e., iPhone2: double tap the \nHome button * or Android3:  \nclick recent apps soft key).Only use original charging cords or \ncharging accessories purchased \nfrom a trusted manufacturer. DO NOT  \nuse public USB charging stations. \nNever connect personal devices to \ngovernment computers, whether via \nphysical connection, Wi-Fi,  \nor Bluetooth.\n31\n!\nUpdate the device software \nand applications as soon as \npossible. \nConsider using Biometrics \n(e.g., fingerprint, face) \nauthentication for \nconvenience to protect data \nof minimal sensitivity.\nUse strong lock-screen \npins/passwords: a 6-digit \nPIN is sufficient if the \ndevice wipes itself after \n10 incorrect password \nattempts. Set the device \nto lock automatically  \nafter 5 minutes. \nInstall a minimal number of \napplications and only ones \nfrom official application \nstores.
