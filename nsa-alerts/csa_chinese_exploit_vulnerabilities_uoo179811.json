These networks \noften undergo a full array of tactics and techniques used by Chin ese state -sponsored cyber actors  to exploit computer \nnetworks of interest that hold sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Since these \ntechniques include exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities , it is critical that network defenders prioritize patching and \nmitigation efforts.   \nThe same process for planning the exploitation of a computer network by any sophisticated cyber actor is used by \nChinese  state -sponsored hackers. They often first identify a target, gather technical information on the target, identify any \nvulnerabilities asso ciated with the target, develop or re -use an exploit for those vulnerabilities, and then launch their \nexploitation operation.  \nThis advisory provides Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) known to be recently leveraged , or scanned -for, by \nChinese state-sponsored cyber actors to enable successful hacking operations against a multitude of victim networks. \nMost of the vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited to gain initial access to victim networks  using products that  are \ndirectly accessible from th e Internet and act as gateways to internal networks . The majority of the products are either for \nremote access (T1133)1 or for external web services (T1190), and should be prioritized for immediate patching. While \nsome vulnerabilities have specific additio nal mitigations below, t he following  mitigations generally apply : \n Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after patches are released.2 \n Expect that data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before the device was patched \nwill not be alleviated by patching, making password changes and reviews of accounts a good practice.  \n Disable external management capabilities  and set up  an out -of-band management network .3 \n Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations.4 \n Isolate Internet -facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) to reduce the exposure of the internal \nnetwork.5 \n Enable robust logging o f Internet -facing services and monitor the logs for sign s of compromise.6 \nDetailed Vulnerabilities and Mitigations  \nThe following is a list of CVEs being actively used by Chinese state -sponsored cyber actors , a description of the \nvulnerability, and the recommended mitigations.  (NOTE: The following list of CVEs is non -exhaustive of what is available \nor perhaps used by Chinese state -sponsored cyber actors, but is a list of those  being operationalized by China .) \nCVE Number  Vulnerability Description  Prior NSA Cybersecurity Guidance   \n(Some focused on other actors)  \nCVE-2019 -11510  In Pulse Secure  VPNs , 7 an unauthenticated remote \nattacker can send a specially crafted URI to perform an \narbitrary file reading vulnerability.

Transition \nSSLVPN/TLSVPN deployments to eithe r IETF standard -conformant TLS  for single application use cases, or to IKE/IPsec VPNs,  \nprefer ably using one of  the evaluated TLS software applications or IPSec  VPN gateways/clients listed on the National Information \nAssurance Partnership (NIAP) Product Compliant List (PCL).   \nCVE-2020 -5902  In F5 BIG -IP 8  proxy / load balancer devices , the Traffic \nManagement User Interface (TMUI) - also referred to as \nthe Configuration utility  - has a Remote Code Execution \n(RCE) vulnerability in undisclosed pages.

[2] \n \nAdditional Mitigations : By default, the TMUI is accessible via the management  interface on both the external and internal interface. \nBest practice is to disable the external interface and configure an out -of-band management network.

CSA  Patch Critical Vulnerability in \nWindows Servers using DNS Server Role  \nU/OO/152726 -20 \nAffects:  Microsoft Windows Server 2008 - 2019  \n \nAdditional Mitigations : Keep system and product updated and patched. In the event that an update cannot be applied immediately, \nthe following workaround will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited , per Microsofts recommendation. The workaround \nconfigures Windows DNS s ervers to restrict the size of acceptable DNS message packets over TCP to 65,280 bytes (0xFF00). \nApplying the workaround requires a restart of the DNS service.
