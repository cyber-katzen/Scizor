Since July 2021, BlackMatt er \nransomware has targeted multiple U.S. critical \ninfrastructure entities , including two U.S. Food and \nAgriculture Sector organizations .  \nThis advisory provides  information on cyber actor tactics, \ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained from a \nsample of BlackMatter ransomware analyzed in  a \nsandbox environment  as well from trusted third -party reporting. Using embedded, previously \ncompromised credentials, BlackM atter leverages the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) \nand Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to access the Active Directory (AD) to discover all hosts \non the network. BlackMatter then remotely encrypts the  hosts and shared drives as they are fo und. \nRansomware attacks against critical infrastructure entities could directly affect consumer access to \ncritical infrastructure services ; therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA  urge all organizations, including \ncritical infrastructure organizations, to  implem ent the recommendations listed in the Mitigations \nsection of this joint advisory. These mitigations will help organizations reduce the risk of compromise \nfrom BlackMatter ransomware attacks.  Actions you Can Take Now to \nProtect Against BlackMatter \nRansomware:  \n Implement and enforce backup \nand restoration policies and \nprocedures.  \n Use strong, unique passwords . \n Use multi-factor authentication . \n Implement network segmentation \nand traversal monitoring.  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 2 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \n \nTECHNICAL DETAILS  \nOverview  \nFirst seen in July 2021, BlackMat ter is ransomware -as-a-service (Raas) tool that allows  the \nransomwares developers to profit from cybercriminal affiliates (i.e., BlackMatter actors) who deploy it  \nagainst victims . BlackMatter is a possible rebrand of DarkSide, a RaaS which was active from \nSeptember 2020 through May 2021. BlackMatter actors have attacked numerous  U.S.-based \norganizations and have demanded ransom payments ranging from $80,000 to $15,000,000 in Bitcoin \nand Monero.  \nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures  \nThis advisory provides  inform ation on cyber actor TTPs \nobtained from the following sample of BlackMatter \nransomware , which was analyzed  in a sandbox \nenvironment , as well as from trusted third parties: SHA -\n256: 706f3eec328e91ff7f66c8f0a2fb9b556325  \nc153a329a2062dc85879c540839d . (Note : click here  to \nsee the samples page on VirusTotal.)  \nThe BlackMatter variant  uses  embedded admin or user credentials  that were previously com promised  \nand  NtQuerySystemInformation  and EnumServicesStatusExW  to enumerate running processes \nand services, respectively. BlackMatter then uses the embedded credentials in the LDAP and SMB \nprotocol to discover all hosts in the AD and the srvsvc.NetShareE numAll  Microsoft Remote \nProcedure Call (MSRPC) function to enumerate each host for accessible shares. Notably, this variant \nof BlackMatter leverages the embedded credentials and SMB protocol to remotely encrypt, from the \noriginal compromised host, all disc overed shares contents , including ADMIN$ , C$, SYSVOL , and  \nNETLOGON .  \nBlackMatter actors use a separate encryption binary for Linux-based machines and routinely encrypt \nESXI virtual machines. Rather than encrypting backup systems, BlackMatter actors  wipe or reformat \nbackup data stores and appliances .  \nTable 1 maps BlackMatters capabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, based on \nthe analyzed variant and trusted third -party reporting.  \nTable 1: BlackMatter Actors and Ransomware TTPs  \nTactic Technique  Procedure  \nPersistence \n[TA0003 ] External Remote Services  \n[T1133 ] BlackMatter leverage s legitimate  remote \nmonitoring and management software \nand remote desktop software, often by This advisory uses the MITRE \nATT&CK framework , version 9. \nSee the ATT&CK for Enterprise  for \nall referenced threat actor tactics and \ntechniques.  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 3 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \nTactic Technique  Procedure  \nsetting up tri al accounts, to maintain \npersistence on victim networks.   \nCredential Access \n[TA0006 ] OS Cre dential Dumping: LSASS \nMemory [ T1003.001 ] BlackMatter harvests credentials from \nLocal Security Authority Subsystem \nService ( LSASS ) memory using procmon . \nDiscovery \n[TA0007 ] Remote System Discovery \n[T1018 ] BlackMatter leverages LDAP and SMB \nprotocol to discover all hosts in the AD.  \nProcess Disco very [ T1057 ] BlackMatter uses \nNtQuerySystemInformation  to \nenumerate running processes.  \nSystem Service Discovery \n[T1007 ] BlackMatter uses \nEnumServicesStatusExW  to enumerate \nrunning services on the network.  \nLateral Movement \n[TA0008 ] Remote Services: SMB/Windows \nAdmin Shares [ T1021.002 ] BlackMatter uses \nsrvsvc.NetShareEnumAll  MSRPC \nfunction to enumerate and SMB to \nconnect to all discovered shares, \nincluding ADMIN$ , C$, SYSVOL , and  \nNETLOGON . \nExfiltration \n[TA0010 ] Exfiltration Over Web Service \n[T1567 ] BlackMatter attempt s to exfiltrate data for \nextortion.  \nImpact [ TA0040 ] Data Encrypted for Impact \n[T1486 ] BlackMatter remotely encrypts shares via \nSMB protocol and drops a ransomware  \nnote in each directory.  \nDisk Wipe [ T1561 ] BlackMatter may wipe backup systems.  \n \nDETECTION SIGNATURES  \nThe following Snort signatures may be used for detecting network activity associated with BlackMatter \nactivity.  \nIntrusion Detection System Rule:  \nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";  \ncontent:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 00|\";  content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41 00 44 \n00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00| \"; distance:100; detection_filter: track by_src, count \n4, seconds 1; priority:1; sid:11111111111; )  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 4 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \nInline Intrusion Prevention System Rule:  \nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";  \ncontent:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 0 0|\";  content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41 00 44 \n00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00|\"; distance:100; priority:1; sid:10000001; )  \nrate_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 10000001, track by_src, count 4, seconds 1, \nnew_action reject, timeout 86400  \nMITIGATIONS  \nCISA , the FBI, and NSA  urge network defenders, especially for  critical infrastructure organizations , to \napply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by BlackMatter ransomware:  \nImplement Detection Signatures  \n Implement the detection signatures identified above . These signatures will identify and \nblock placement  of the ransom note on the first share that is encrypted, subsequently blocking \nadditional SMB traffic from the encryptor system for  24 hours.  \nUse Strong Passwords  \n Require all accounts with password logi ns (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and \ndomain admin accounts) to have strong , unique passwords . Passwords should not be \nreused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have \naccess. Note : devices with local administrative accounts should implement a password policy \nthat requires  strong, unique passwords for each indivi dual administrative account .  \nImplement Multi -Factor Authentication  \n Require multi -factor authentication  for all services to the extent possible, particularly for \nwebmail, virtual private networks,  and accounts that access critical systems.  \nPatch and Update Systems  \n Keep all operating systems and software up to date . Timely patching is one of the most \nefficient and cost -effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to \ncybersecurit y threats.  \nLimit Access to Resources over the Network  \n Remove un necessary access to administrativ e shares , especially ADMIN$  and C$. If \nADMIN$  and C$ are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to only the necessary \nservice or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for anomalous activity.  \n Use a host -based firewall to only allow  connections to administrative shares via SMB from a \nlimited set of administrator machines.  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 5 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \nImplement Network Segmentation and Traversal Monitoring  \nAdversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility and \nmapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organizations enterprise environment, limit common \nsystem and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions.  \n Segment networks  to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help \nprevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows betw eenand access to \nvarious subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.  \n Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the \nindicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.  To aid in detecting the \nransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral \nmovement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly \nuseful for detecting lateral connections as they  have insight into common and uncommon \nnetwork connections for each host.  \nUse Admin Disabling Tools to Support Identity and Privileged Access Management  \nIf BlackMatter uses compromised  credentials during non -business hours, the compromise may not be \ndetec ted. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware attacks during non -\nbusiness hours, especially holidays and weekends , CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend \norganizations:  \n Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin  level and higher . For \nexample,  the Just-in-Time (JIT)  access method provision s privileged access when needed \nand can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust \nmodel). This is a process where a network -wide policy is set in place to automatically disable \nadmin accounts at the AD level when the  account is not in direct need. When the account is \nneeded, individual users submit their requests through an automated process that enables \naccess to a system, but on ly for a set timeframe to support task completion.   \n Disable command -line and scripting activities and permissions . Privilege escalation and \nlateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat \nactors are not able to  run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or \nmoving laterally.  \nImplement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures  \n Maintain offline backups of data , and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This \npractice will ensure the organization w ill not  be severely interrupted, have irretrievable  data, or \nbe held up by a ransom demand.  \n Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable  (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted) and  \ncovers the entire organizations data infrastructure.  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 6 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \nCISA , the FBI, and NSA  urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the following additional \nmitigations to reduce the risk of crede ntial compromise.  \n Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory . \n Consider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM)  \nand WDigest Authentication.  \n Implement Credential Guard  for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft: Manage \nWindows Defender Credential Guard  for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2, \nenable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).  \n Minimize the AD attack surface  to reduce malicious ticket -granting activity . Malicious activity \nsuch as Kerberoasting take s advantage o f Kerberos Ticket Granting service and can be \nused to obtain hashed credential s that attackers attempt to crack.  \no Set a strong  password policy for service accounts.  \no Audit Domain Controllers to  log successful Kerberos Ticket -Granting Service requests \nand ensure the events are monitored for anomalous activity.   \nRefer to the CISA -Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS -ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide  \nfor general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by ransomware attacks.  \nNote : critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology \nnetworks should review joint CISA -FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21 -131A: DarkSide Ransomware: \nBest Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks  for more mitigations, \nincluding mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity \nfall victim to a ransomware attack.  \nRESPONDING TO RANSO MWARE ATTACKS  \nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, C ISA, the FBI, and NSA  recommend : \n Following the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA -Multi -State \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (MS -ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide . \n Scanning backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is \nfree of malware.  \n Reporting incidents immediately  to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office , CISA at us-\ncert.cisa.gov/report , or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret Service Field Office .  \n Applying incident response best practices  found in the joint Advisory, Technical \nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Act ivity, developed by CISA and the \ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.  \nNote : CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly  discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a \nransom may embolden adversaries to target ad ditional organizations, encourage other criminal actors \nto engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also \ndoes not guarantee that a victims files will be recovered.  \n\n \n \n \nDraft \n \n  CISA  |  FBI | NSA \n \nPage 7 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21 -291A \nTLP: WHITE    TLP:WHITE  \nRESOURCES  \n For more information and r esources on protecting against and responding to ransomware, \nrefer to StopRansomware.gov , a centralized, whole -of-government webpage providing \nransomware resources and alerts.  \n CISAs Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA)  is a no-cost self-assessment based on a \ntiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to \ndefend and recover from a ransomware incident.  \n CISA offers a range of  no-cost cyber hygiene services  to help critical infrastructure \norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, includin g ransomware.
