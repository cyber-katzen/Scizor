These devices can cause a loss of intellectual property and damage to reputation. Counterfeit hardware and software have appeared across many industries. They are often introduced into the supply chain through non-reputable re-sellers. Unknowingly using grey market devices can significantly compromise your network by introducing vulnerabilities such as logic bombs, backdoors, and altered security functions. It is important to confirm the integrity of devices and software throughout the entire supply chain. \nMaintain Strict Control  \nof the Supply Chain \nHaving robust supply chain management processes can \nreduce the risk of introducing grey market devices:\n\n P\nurchase only from manufacturer-authorized \nresellers.\n\n Obtain an or\niginal copy of the invoice.\n\n V\nerify that all serial numbers match throughout the \nsupply chain.\n\n T\nrain network owners and administrators how to \ndetect grey market devices.\n R\nequire resellers to implement a supply chain \nintegrity check to validate hardware and software authenticity.\nValidate Hardware \n V isually inspect hardware devices for anomalies on \nthe chassis and cards to check for tampering.\n\n Check the pack\naging for any skewed or missing \nlogos as well as missing serial numbers, model numbers, or holograms.\n\n S\nerial numbers on the hardware and boxes  \nshould match.\n\n Examine har\ndware for missing circuit board labels \nor discoloration. Circuit board chips should be in the appropriate location for the device.\nVerify Serial Numbers\nCollect serial numbers and compare using vendor management tools. Once the serial number of the device has been collected, complete a counterfeit assessment to determine if the serial numbers are consistent with the vendors. Check with the vendor to see which tools are available. Examples include: \n\n S\nolarWinds1:  Kiwi CatTools: Use the Report.Version \ntable component to pull serial numbers from  the device. \n\n C\niscoWorks2: Validate the Cisco Internetwork \nOperating System (Cisco IOS) on network devices to determine whether the device has been tampered with. To view the Cisco IOS information, issue the show version , show inventory , and show hardware commands to retrieve the serial number.\n\n Br\nocade3: Use the chassisshow command to \nretrieve serial numbers.\nIf an automated tool is not available, a script can be used to retrieve serial numbers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 SolarWinds is a registered trademark of SolarWinds Worldwide\n2 Cisco IOS is a registered trademark of Cisco Systems, Inc. \n3 Brocade is a registered trademark of Communications Systems, Inc.\n\nValidate Integrity of\nHardware and Software\n MFS U/OO/801553-16\nValidate and Secure Software\nHash software and compare to the vendor database \nto determine whether it has been altered. Additional mitigations to prevent grey market software from being introduced onto a network include:\n D ownload software, patches, and upgrades from \nvalidated sources. Software provided by the vendor should be digitally signed by the vendor.\n\n P\nrotect network information data by encrypting both \nstored configurations and network management communications.\n\n M\naintain secure configurations offline and at an \noffsite location.\nPerform Hash Verification and Comparison\nHash comparison is a method that can be used to verify network device software integrity. Check with the vendor to identify the appropriate integrity validation process and methodology. There are several types of hashes that must be compared with the hash of a known, trusted operating system image from the vendor in order to achieve the highest level of confidence. All of these hashes should be identical. If any of the hashes do not match, the source of the concern should be further examined. An example of a robust hash-based verification processes is:\n\n A\ncquire the known trusted operating image from  \nthe vendor.\n\n C\nalculate the online hash. Remotely log into the \ndevice with proper credentials and use the built-in functionality of the network devices operating system to compute the hash. \n\n D\nerive the offline hash. Copy the operating system \nimage directly from the network device to a trusted system and use the built-in functionality to compute the hash.\n\n C\nompare computed hashes to the trusted known \ngood hashes.\nMonitor Network and Review Logs\nIf a device is suspected of not meeting the quality standards and assessments, it is best not to immediately disconnect or cause a denial of service. This can make it challenging to obtain an authenticated image. Keep in mind, a false positive hash can occur which would create a hash that does not match the vendor hash. \n\n M\nonitor all ports through passive sensors. Data that \nis concentrated on network packets sent to and from the device should be collected and logged. \n\n Check logs f\nor unauthorized logins, unauthorized \nreboots, misconfiguration of settings, and operating system anomalies. This information can then be used by incident response teams for evaluation and can accelerate analysis to isolate the problem. \n\n I\nf there are discrepancies in the logs, the network \ndevice can be removed and replaced if necessary.\n\n C\nontinuously monitor and verify network \nconfigurations on a regular basis in order to determine if the security compromise extends beyond the device.\nDetection and prevention of grey market and counterfeit devices can be improved by incorporating requirement assessments and technical reviews into the acquisition process. Training network owners and administrators will increase awareness of grey market devices. A knowledgeable and cooperative effort will maximize the detection and prevention capabilities for the network.\nContact Information \nIndustry Inquiries:  \nBusiness Affairs Office \n410-854-6091 email: bao@nsa.gov\nClient Requirements and General Information  \nAssurance Inquiries:  \nIAD Client Contact Center \n410-854-4200 \nemail: IAD_CCC@nsa.gov\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions contained in this document \nare provided as is and without any warranties or guarantees.
