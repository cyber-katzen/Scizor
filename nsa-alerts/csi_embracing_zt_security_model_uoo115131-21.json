The Zero Trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node , or service  and instead \nrequires  continuous verification of  the operational picture via real-time information fed from multiple sources  to determine \naccess and  other system responses .  \nThe Zero Trust security model  assumes that a breach i s inevitable or has likely already occurred, so  it constantly  limits \naccess to only what is needed and looks for anomalous or malicious activity . Zero Trust embeds comprehensive security \nmonitoring; granular  risk-based access controls; and system security automation in a coordinated manner throughout all \naspects of the infrastructure in order to focus on protecting critical assets (data) in real -time within a dynamic threat \nenvironment. This data -centric security model allows the concept of least -privileged  access to be applied for every access \ndecision, allowing or denying access to resources  based on the combination of several contextual factors .  \nSystems that are designed using Zero Trust principals should be better positioned to address existing  threats , but \ntransitioning to such a system requires careful planning to avoid weakening the security posture along the way . NSA \ncontinues to monitor the technologies that can contribute to a Zero Trust solution and will provide additional guidance as \nwarranted.   \nTo be fully effective  to minimize risk and enable robust and timely responses , Zero Trust principles and concepts must  \npermeate most aspects of the network and its operations  ecosystem. Organizations , from chief executive to engineer and \noperator , must un derstand and commit to the Zero Trust mindset  before embarking on a Zero Trust path.  \nThe following  cybersecurity guidance explains the  Zero Trust security model and its benefits, as well as challenges for \nimplementation.  It discusses the importance of building a detailed strategy, dedicating the necessary resources, maturing \nthe implementation, and fully committing to the Zero Trust model to achieve the desired results. The following \nrecommendations will assist cybersecur ity leaders, enterprise network owners , and administrators wh o are considering \nembrac ing this modern cyber security model.  \n  \n\n \n \nU/OO/115131 -21 | PP-21-0191  | February 2021 Ver. 1.0  2 \nNSA | Embracing  a Zero Trust Security Model  \nFalling behind  \nTodays  IT landscape is empowered by a connected  world that is more susceptible to malicious activity due to  its \nconn ectedness , user diversity, wealth of devices, and globally distributed applications and services . Systems and users \nrequire simple and secure methods of connecting and interacting  with organizational resources , while also  keeping \nmalicious actors at bay . The increasing complexity of current and emerging cloud, multi-cloud, and hybrid network \nenvironments combined with the rapidly escalating and evolving nature of adversary threats has exposed the lack of \neffectiveness  of traditional network cyber security  defenses . Traditional perimeter -based network defenses  with multiple \nlayers of disjointed  security technologies have proven themselves to be unable  to meet the cyber security needs due to the \ncurrent threat environment . Contemporary  threat actors, from cyber  criminals to nation -state actors,  have become more \npersistent , more stealthy, and more subtle; thus, they demonstrate an ability to penetrat e network perimeter defenses  with \nregularity . These threat  actors , as well as  insider threat  actors , have succeeded  in leveraging their access to endanger \nand inflict harm on national and economic security.  Even the most skilled cybersecurity professionals are challenged \nwhen defend ing dispersed enterprise networks from ever more  sophisticated cyber threats. Organizations need a better \nway to secure their infrastructure and provide unified -yet-granular access control to data, services, applications , and \ninfrastructure . \nBy implementing  a modern cyber security strategy  that integrates visibility from multiple van tage points, makes risk-aware  \naccess decisions, and automates detection and response actions, network defenders will be in a much better position to \nsecure sensitive data, systems , applications , and services. Zero Trust is an assumed breach  security mode l that is \nmeant to  guide cybersecurity  architect s, integrators, and implement ers in integrating disparate but related cybersecurity \ncapabilities into a  cohesive engine for cybersecurity decision -making . However, t o be fully effective, Zero Trust principles  \nneed to permeate most aspects of the network and its operations  ecosystem  to minimize risk and enable robust and \ntimely responses. Organizations that choose  to migrate to  a Zero Trust solution  should fully embrace th is security model \nand the mindset necessary for planning , resourc ing, and operating under this security model to achieve the cybersecurity \noutcomes that a Zero Trust  solution  can deliver  [1] [2] .  \nIncreasingly  sophisticated threats  \nEmbracing a Zero Trust security model, and  re-engineering an existing information system based on this security model , \nis a strategic effort  that will take  time to achieve full benefits. It is not a tactical mitigation response to new adversary tools, \ntactics , and technique s. However , several  recent, highly publicized system breaches have exposed widespread \nvulnerabilities in systems, as well as deficiencies in system management and defensive network operations . These \nincidents show that purely tactical responses are often  insufficient. A  matu re Zero Trust environment will afford \ncybersecurity defenders  more opportunities to  detect novel threat actors, and more response options that can be quickly \ndeployed to address sophisticated threats.  Adopting the mindset required to successfully operate a  Zero Trust \nenvironment will further sensitize cybersecurity defenders to recognize ever more subtle threat indicators.  Tactical \nresponses will likely still be necessary even in a Zero Trust environment, but with the appropriate security model, mindset , \nand response tools, defenders can begin to react effectively to increasingly sophisticated threats .   \nWhat is Zero Trust?  \nZero Trust is a security model , a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system \nmanagement strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside  traditional network \nboundaries. Zero Trust repeatedly questions the premise that user s, devices, and network components should be  \nimplicitly trusted based on their location within the network. Zero Trust embeds comprehensive security monitoring; \ngranular, dynamic , and risk -based access controls; and system security automation in a coordina ted manner throughout \nall aspects of the infrastructure in order to focus specifically on protecting  critical assets (data) in real -time within  a \ndynamic threat environment.  This data -centric security model allows the concept of least privileged access to be applied \nfor every access decision, where the answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how are critical for \nappropriately allow ing or denying  access to resources  [3].  \nNSA strongly recommends that a Zero Trust security model  be considered for critical networks to include National \nSecurity Systems  (NSS) , Department of Defense (DoD) networks, and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) systems . Integrating \n\n \n \nU/OO/115131 -21 | PP-21-0191  | February 2021 Ver. 1.0  3 \nNSA | Embracing  a Zero Trust Security Model  \nthese principles within  certain environments, especially within  a large enterprise , can become  complicated. To address \nthese challenges, NSA  is develop ing additional guidance  to organize, guide , and simplify the Zero Trust design approach.  \nAdopt  a Zero Trust mindset  \nTo adequately address the modern dynamic threat environment  requires :  \n Coordinated and  aggressive system monitoring, system management , and defensive operations capabilit ies.  \n Assuming  all requests for critical resou rces and all network traffic may be  malicious.  \n Assuming  all devices and infrastructure may be  compromised.  \n Accepting that  all access approvals to critical resources incur risk, and be ing prepared to perform rapid damage \nassessment, control , and recovery operations.  \nEmbrace  Zero Trust guiding principles  \nA Zero Trust solution  requires operational capabilities that :  \n Never trus t, always v erify   Treat e very user, device, application/workload, and data flow as untrusted . \nAuthenticate and explicitly authorize each  to the least privilege required using dynamic security policies.   \n Assume b reach   Consciously operate and defend resou rces with the assumption that an adversary already has \npresence within the environment.  Deny by default and heavily scrutinize all users, devices, data flows , and requests \nfor access . Log, inspect, and continuously monitor all configuration changes , resour ce accesses, and network traffic \nfor suspicious activity.  \n Verify e xplicitly   Access to all resources should be conducted  in a consistent  and secure manner using multiple \nattributes (dynamic and static) to derive confidence levels for contextual access decisions to resources.  \nLeverage  Zero Trust design c oncepts  \nWhen  designing a Zero Trust solution:   \n Define mission o utcomes   Derive the  Zero Trust architecture from organiz ation -specific mission  requirements \nthat identify the  critical Data/Assets/Applications/Services (DAAS).  \n Architect from the inside out   First, focus on protecting critical  DAAS.  Second, secure a ll paths to access them.  \n Determi ne who/what needs access to the DAAS to create access  control policies   Create security policies \nand apply them consistently across all environments (LAN, WAN, endpoint, perimeter, mobile, etc.).  \n Inspect and log all traffic before acting   Establish f ull visibility of all activity across all layers from endpoints and \nthe network to ena ble analytics  that can detect suspicious activity . \nExamples of Zero Trust in use \nThe fundamental purpose of  Zero Trust is to understand and control  how users , processes , and devices engage with \ndata. The combination of the user, device, and any other security -relevant contextual information  (e.g., location, time of \nday, previous logged behavior of the user or device)  to be used to make an access decision is called a tuple. As part of \nthis tuple, explicit authentication of both the user and the device i s required to have reliable information in the tuple. The \nZero Trust decision engine examines the tuple in the access request and compares that to the security policy for the data \nor resource being requested. It then makes a risk -informed decision on wheth er to allow access and sends a log entry of \nthat access request and decision to be part of future suspicious activity analytics. This process is  conducted for every \nindividual access request to each sensitive resource and can be  repeated periodically durin g extended access to a \nresource.  \nThe fo llowing are a few example cases where a mature Zero Trust implementation can detect malicious activity better \nthan a traditional architecture usually can.  \nCompromised user credentials  \nIn this example , a malicious  cyber actor compromises a legitimate users credentials and attempts to access \norganizational resources.  In this case, the malicious actor is using an unauthorized device, either through remote access \n\n \n \nU/OO/115131 -21 | PP-21-0191  | February 2021 Ver. 1.0  4 \nNSA | Embracing  a Zero Trust Security Model  \nor with a rogue device joining the organizations wire less LAN.  In a traditional network the users credentials alone are \noften sufficient to grant access, but in a Zero Trust environment the device is not known, so the device fails authentication  \nand authorization checks  and so access is denied and the malic ious activity is logged. In addition, Zero Trust requires \nstrong authentication for user and device identities . Use  of strong  multi -factor authentication of users , which is \nrecommended for Zero Trust environments,  can make stealing the users credentials m ore difficult in the first place.  \nRemote e xploitation or i nsider threat  \nIn this example,  a malicious cyber actor compromises a users device th rough an I nternet -based mobile code exploit . Or, \nthe actor is an inside authorized  user with malicious intent ions. In a typical , non-Zero Trust scenario, the actor uses the \nusers  credentials, enumerates the network, escalates privileges, and moves laterally through the network  to compromise \nvast stores of data and, ultimately, persist . In a Zero Trust network, the c ompromised users credentials and the device \nare already assumed to be malicious  until proven otherwise , and the network is segmented , limiting both enumeration and \nlateral movement opportunities.  While the malicious actor can authenticate as both the user  and the device , access to \ndata will be limited based on security policy, user role, and the user and device attributes.  In a mature Zero Trust \nenvironment, d ata encryption and digital rights management may offer additional protection s by limiting which data can be \naccessed and the actions that can be taken with  the sensitive data  even if access was allowed . Further , analytic \ncapabilities continuously monitor for anomalous activity in accounts, devices, network activity , and data access.  While a \nlevel of compromise occurs  in this scenario , damage is limited and the time for defensive systems to detect and initiate \nappropriate mitigating respon ses is greatly reduced .  \n \nFigure 1: Example of Zero Trust remote exploitation scenario s where most \nattempts would have been successful in non -Zero Trust environments.  \n\n \n \nU/OO/115131 -21 | PP-21-0191  | February 2021 Ver. 1.0  5 \nNSA | Embracing  a Zero Trust Security Model  \nCompromised supply c hain  \nIn this example , a malicious actor embed s malicious code in a popular enterprise network device or appli cation . The \ndevice or application is maintained and regularly updated on the organizations network  in accordance with best practices . \nIn a traditional network architecture, this device  or application would be internal  and fully trusted.  While this type of \ncompromise can be particularly severe  because i t is implicitly so trusted , in a mature implementation of a Zero Trust \narchitecture , real defensive cybersecurity benefits are obtained  since t he device or appli cation  would not be inherently \ntrusted . Its privileges and access to data would be tightly controlled , minimized , and monitored ; segmentation (macro and \nmicro) would be enforced by policy ; and analytics would be used to monitor for anomalous activity.  In addition, while the \ndevice may be able to download signed application updates  (malicious or not) , the devices allowed network connections \nunder a Zero Trust design would employ a deny -by-default security policy, so  any attempt to connect to other  remote \naddress es for command and control would likely be blocked . Also, network monitoring could detect and block attempted \nlateral movement from the device or an application not associated with an authorized access request.   \nZero Trust maturity  \nImplementing Z ero Trust takes time and effort : it cannot be implemented over night. For many networks, existing \ninfrastructure can be leveraged and integrated to incorporate  Zero Trust concepts, but the transition to a mature Zero \nTrust architecture often requires additional capabilities to obtain  the full benefits of a Zero Trust environment . Transitioning \nto a mature Zero Trust architecture  all at once is also not necessary. Incorporating  Zero Trust functionality incrementally  \nas part of  a strategic plan  can reduce risk  accordingly  at each step . As the  Zero Trust implementation matures over time, \nenhanced visibility and automated responses allow defenders to  keep pace with the threat.  \nNSA recommends  embracing the Zero Trust security model when  considering how to integrate Zero Trust concepts into \nan existing environment.  Zero Trust efforts  should be planned out as a continually maturing roadmap, from initial \npreparation to basic, intermediate , and advanced stages , with cybersecurity protection, response , and operations \nimproving  over time . \n \nFigure 2 : Maturing a Zero Trust implementation  \n\n\n \n \nU/OO/115131 -21 | PP-21-0191  | February 2021 Ver. 1.0  6 \nNSA | Embracing  a Zero Trust Security Model  \nPotential challenges  on the path to Zero Trust  \nWhen implementing Zero Trust in enterprise networks, several challenges may arise that reduce the effectiveness of the \nsolution. The first potential challenge  is a lack of full support thr oughout the enterprise, possibly from leadership, \nadministrators, or users. The mindset required for Zero Trust must be embraced fully for any solution to be successful. If \nleaders are unwilling to spend the necessary resources to build and sustain it, if adminis trators and network defenders do \nnot have buy-in or the requisite  expertise, or if users are allowed to circumvent the policies, then the benefits of Zero Trust \nwill not be realized in that environment. Once  even  basic or intermediate Zero Trust cap abilities are integrated into a \nnetwork , follow -through is necessary  to mature the implementation and achieve full benefits  [4].  \nWith the pervasive need for Zero Trust concepts to be applied throughout the environment, scalability of the capabilities is \nessential. Access control decisions that may have only occurred once for each access previously will now be performed \ncontinuously as access to the resource is used, requiring a robust infrastructure for making, enforcing, and then logging \nthese access decisions. In addition, elements of the network that previously were not part of access control decisions may  \nbecome essential element s whose reliability and consistent use are required, such as data tags and additional network \nsensors.  \nPersistent adherence to the mindset, and application of the Zero Trust security model over time is also a key requirement. \nAdministrators and defenders m ay become fatigued with constantly applying  default -deny security policies and always \nassuming a breach is occurring, but if the Zero Trust approach falters , then its cyber security benefits become significantly \ndegraded or eliminated .  \nCarefully minimizing  embedded trust empowers a more secure mission  \nThe ever -increasing complexity of network environments and the ability of adversaries to compromise them requires a \nchange in defensive focus. The Zero Trust mindset focuses on securing critical data and acces s paths by eliminating  trust \nas much as possible , coupled with verifying and regularly re -verifying every allowed access. However, implementing Zero \nTrust should not be undertaken lightly and will require significant resources and persistence to achieve. W hen properly \nand fully implemented, Zero Trust should be able to prevent, detect, and contain intrusions significantly faster and more \neffectively than traditional, less integrated cybersecurity architectures  and approaches . \nFurther guidance  \nNSA is assisting DoD customers in piloting Zero Trust systems, coordinating activities with existing NSS and DoD \nprograms, and developing additional Zero Trust guidance to support system developers through the challen ges of \nintegrating Zero Trust within  NSS, DoD , and DIB environment s. Upcoming a dditional guidance  will help organize, guide, \nand simplify incorporating Zero Trust principles and designs into enterprise networks.
