Much of the \npublished guidance focuses on Windows but the vulnerability is not in Windows. All systems and devices[4] that include \nor use the vulnerable  library are affected.  \nMITIGATION ACTIONS  \nA custom Tenable Nessus audit file and PowerShell script are available at http://www.github.com/iadgov/Detect -\nCVE-2017 -15361 -TPM  to aid in identifying Windows systems that have a vulnerable TPM enabled. Ensure  all \nSeptember and October 2017 Microsoft Patch Tuesday patches are installed first. Install OEM -provided firmware \nupdates that patch the vulnerable library. See Microsoft security advisory ADV170012[5] to determine the correct actions \nto take for the va rious Windows features and services that use a TPM. Clear and re -initialize the TPM to generate new \nkeys.  \nENDNOTES  \n[1] Information on software update of RSA key generation function. \nhttps://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/rsa -update  \n[2] Vulner ability Note VU#307015: Infineon RSA library does not properly generate RSA key pairs. \nhttps://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307015  \n[3] Information on TPM firmware update for Microsoft Windows systems. \nhttps://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/tpm -updat e \n[4] Security Advisory 2017 -10-16. https://www.yubico.com/support/security -advisories/ysa -2017 -01  \n[5] ADV170012 | Vulnerability in TPM could allow Security Feature Bypass. https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en -\nus/security -guidance/advisory/ADV170012  \nDISCLAIMER OF ENDORS EMENT  \nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees. \nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacture r, or \notherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government, \nand this guidance shall not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.  \n \n                                                \n1 RSA is a registered trademark of RSA Security LLC  \n\n \n \n2 U/OO/801084 -17          PP -17-0820          24 OCTOBER 2017  \n  \nTRADEMARK INFORMATIO N \nInfineon is a registered trademark of Infineon Technologies AG.
