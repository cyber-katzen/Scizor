It further discusses how these capabilities integrate \ninto a comprehensive Zero Trust (ZT) framework, as described in Embracing a Zero \nTrust Security M odel. [1] Traditional security approaches have  often relied on perimeter \ndefenses  alone to secure networks. Recent events highlight that adversaries who are \nsucces sful at gaining a foothold in information systems often readily gain unfettered \naccess to all data in those systems . By applying the reco mmendations in the d ata pillar, \nincluding identifying  risks to data , integrating granular data attributes into access c ontrol \nmechanisms , and monitoring data  access and use , organizations will  reduce  the impact \nand consequences of breaches and identify  suspect activity earlier in the cyber intrusion  \nlifecycle.  \nTo protect data, an organization  need s to know what data it has  and track how it moves \nand is  accessed inside and outside  the enterprise. Tracking  data can be a significant \ntask, so having an automated method for identifying data of value on the network or \nperforming a data inventory  operation is recommended . Data pro tection ensures that \ndata is only accessed by authorized entities . Granular control of data not only keeps it \nsafe within the enterprise, but also ensures that it can be safely shared with other \norganizations and partners to achieve interoperability. Imple menting these activities will \nlimit the ability of adversar ies to reach targeted  data assets . It will also provide  visibility \nto system managers of  compromised assets that require mitigation should adversaries \nbe successful in their efforts.  \n  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n2 Introductio n \nIn September 2017 , a major credit reporting agency (CRA) reported it had been the \nvictim of a data breach resulting in the theft of records from 148 million American \ncustomers. The stolen data included highly sensitive personally identifiable information  \n(PII), such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, dates of birth, residential \nrecords, and drivers license numbers . [2] The incident  began with access to a \nvulnerable server, whereupon PII from dispute resolution documents was stolen and \nadditional login credentials obtained. The cyber threat actors  then used those \ncredentials to penetrate deeper into the network  and pilfer a staggering amount of data \nover a 76 -day period in which they accessed 51 different databases . [3] \nAs one of the nations largest CRAs, this companys data was highly valuable and the \nloss of it extremely costly to itself and its customers. The CRA agreed in 2022 to a \nglobal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission of $425 million paid to those \naffected by the breach . [4] If the data had resided within a ZT enabled environment, the \nbreach could have been prevented, or  at least lessened due to controls on data access \nand use.  The ZT security model assumes that a breach is inevitable or has likely \noccur red already , so it constantly limits access to only what is needed and looks for \nanomalous or malicious activity . [1] \nZero Trust is a security model, a set of sys tem design principles, and a coordinated \ncybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that \nthreats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries. The Zero Trust \nsecurity model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or service and instead \nrequires continuous verification of the operational picture via real -time information fed \nfrom multiple sources to determine access and other system responses . [1] This \nguidance focuses on the data pillar, which specifically addresses data cataloging, \ngovernance, attributes and tags , monitoring, encryption, loss prevention, and access \ncontrol.  \nThe information presented in this report  is not a definitive guide with a standardized \nsolution that fits all organizational needs, but rather provides suggestions and \nconsiderations for adopting  ZT. Discovering and identifying the assets that need to be \nsecured to support the  organization s mission will help build a picture of the current \narchitecture for applying  the recommendations in these seven ZT pillar report s. This \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n3 picture of the current architecture will help all stakeholders identify organizational risks \nand gaps and ultimately in form building  a mature ZT architecture for the organization. \nThe ultimate goal is to integrate these principles into a comprehensive ZT strategy \naligned  with the organizations security objectives . \nAdopting ZT principles is not accomplished overnight. Implementing them is achieved \nthrough careful and deliberate planning and continuous  incremental improvements  that \nbring cybersecurity protections, responses, and operations to maturity over time.  \nBuilding capabilities aligned to a mature ZT framework requires  integrating every \nsystem in the enterprise with the appropriate security controls, best practices, \nconfiguration management, and vulnerability management for each of the seven pillars : \nUser, Device, Network & Environment , Data , Application  & Workload, Visibility & \nAnalytics, and Automation & Orchestration.  Each pillar  constitute s a key focus area  of \nZT implementation , with the data pillar effectively secured by the other six . [5] \nAudience  \nThis report  provides guidance primarily intended for N ational Security System (NSS) , \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB)  networks , but may be \nuseful for owners and operators of other systems that might be targeted by \nsophisticated malicious actors. Guidance for other system owners and operators is also \navailable via the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [6] and the \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) . [7] This guidance is \ncompatible with the DoD ZT guidance referenced at the end of this document.  [5] \nBackground  \nThe Presidents Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity (EO 14028)  \n[8] and National Security Memorandum 8 (NSM -8) [9] direct the Federal Civilian \nExecuti ve Branch (FCEB) agencies and NSS owners and operators to develop plans to \nadopt a ZT cybersecurity framework .  \nIn the NSA report , Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model , the concept of ZT is defined \nand contextualized along with the undergirding principles of the seven pillars  [1] as \nillustrated in the following figure. The pillars are made up of several capabilities that \nearmark the progressive maturity of a comprehensive ZT framework. The ca pabilities \ndescribed in this report  are intended to continually mature cybersecurity protec tions, \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n4 responses, and operations over time. Progression of capabilities in each pillar should be \nseen as a cycle of continuous improvement based on evaluation and monitoring of \nthreats .  \n \nFigure 1: Description of the seven pillars of ZT \nFigure 1 depicts the ZT pillars, including the data pillar. The capabilities and milestones \nfor the data pillar component of the ZT maturity model are described in detail throughout \nthis report.  The pillars are not independent; many capabilities in the data pillar depend \non or align with capabilities in other pillars as indicated.  \nData pillar \nAn organizations data is extremely important and valuable. It is data, in its many forms, \nthat is target ed by malicious entities. Customer records, user credentials, proprietary \ninformation, employee personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, \npersonal emails, etc. are all fundamental to an organization. The ZT architecture is \ndesigned as a data -centric security model that draws on each connected pillar to ensure \nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organizations data , whether it exists \nwithin or outside of the network.   \n\n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n5 The data pillar focuses on securing and enforcing access to data at rest and in transit \nthrough various methods , including encryption, tagging and labeling, data loss \nprevention (DLP) strategies , and appl ication of  data rights management (DRM)  tools . \nAdditionally, securi ng data so it is accessed exclusively by authorized users is a primary \nresponsibility of the data pillar and should not be taken for granted. The data pillar \nderives security benefits from capabilities performed by the other six pillars . Those \ncapabilities  are mapped  to the DoD Chief Information Office (CIO) ZT Strategy, and \nNIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture . [10], [6] \nThis report  identifies the  following  capabilities and aligns them to ZT maturity levels : \n Data catalog risk alignment  \n Enterprise data governance  \n Data labeling and tagging  \n Data monitoring and sensing  \n Data encryption and rights management  \n Data loss prevention  \n Data access control  \n \nFigure 2: ZT data pillar maturity  \n\n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n6 Data catalog risk alignment  \nThe first step in controlling data against threats is to identify all types of data in the \nenvironment and assess their risks of exposure, loss of availability, and loss of integrity. \nAn enterprise data catalog should be a  comprehensive inventory of data within the \nenterprise  available for reference . This catalog , while not containin g the data itself,  \nincludes metadata about the data, governance policies, and data usage . [5] \nData owners within an organization are aware of the details and purpose of their data. \nThey must ensure their data is identified, inventoried, and categorized in the data \ncatalog . This enterp rise view of the data helps to facilitate data governance activities . \nWhen data owners review the catalog, they can identify potential risks or risk levels \nrelated to data loss, breach , or any other unauthorized alteration and/or access to data.  \nTable 1: Data catalog risk alignment maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nData landscape is \nreviewed to \nidentify potential \nrisks related to \ndata loss, breach , \nor any other \nunauthorized \nalteration and/or \naccess.  \n \nData ownership is \nidentified, and \ndata is \ncatalogued based \non resource \ncriticality.  Critical \norganization data \nis manually \nidentified  and \ninventoried .  \n \nCurrent state is \nrecorded  and data \nbaseline set . \n Automated \nprocesses are \nestablished to \nidentify and monitor \nthe data landscape \nwithin the catalog.  \n \nProcesses are \nenabled to ensure \ndata is  \nautomatically \ndetected and \nincluded within the \ncatalog.  \n \nData usage \npatterns are \nestablished.  Data is known and \ncan be collected, \ntagged, and protected \naccording to risk \nlevels in alignment \nwith a prioritization \nframework, and \nencrypted for \nprotection.  \n \nData is continuously \nanalyzed  to evaluate \nrisk. Tooling is \nemployed  to discover \nimproperly tagged \nsensitive data and \nalert/quarantine the \ndata.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n7 Enterprise data governance  \nEnterprise data governance ensures that data is controlled, accessed, and shared \nacross organizations  according to defined policies  based on inputs from their \ncybersecurity infrastructure . Enterprise data labeling and tagging , access control  and \nsharing pol icies, along with  Data as a Service ( DaaS) capabilities  where applicable , \nensure enforceability at the data object level.  [11] \nTable 2: Enterprise data governance maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganization  \ndevelops  \nenterprise data \nlabeling/tagging \nand access \ncontrol/sharing \npolicies that are \nenforceable.  \n \nData tagging and \ninteroperability \nstandards are \ndefined.  Data is tagged and \nlabeled in \ncompliance with \napplicable \nenterprise policies.  \n \nData is encrypted \nwith published \nenterprise \nframeworks  \naccording to \nenterprise policies .  Data protection \npolicies are assessed \nand refined for \ninteroperability \nacross networks and \npartner \norganizations.  \n \nOrganization  \nestablishes just -in-\ntime and just -enough \ndata access control  \npolicie s. Rules and access \ncontrols are \nautomated through \ncentral policy \nmanagement.  \n \nPolicies are \nreviewed on a \nperiodic basis and \nsolutions regularly \nupdated to remain \nin compliance . \nData labeling and tagging  \nEstablishing granular data attributes  integrated into access control systems  (e.g. data \ntagging) consistent ly and correctly is required for machine enforceable data access \ncontrols, risk assessment, and situational awareness. As data attribute tagging and \nlabeling practices mature,  labeling should  become  automated to meet scaling demands \nand provide better labeling accuracy . Orga nizations should apply granular  attributes  to \nsecurity and mission critical data on high value assets  first.  \nOrganizations should tag d ata in accordance  with enterprise policies . Phases of \nimplementation should advance toward full automation to enable acc urate tagging at \nscale. Once data is properly label ed and tagg ed, the organization  should  establish  \nautomated data access controls, risk assessment s, and monitoring for situational \nawareness  based on enterprise governance policies. [12] \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n8 Table 3: Data labeling and tagging maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nData tagging \nstandards are \ndefined  and \ntools configured \nto support \nenterprise \npolicies .  Data tagging and \nclassification tools \nare implemented.  \n \nData owners \nmanually label and \ntag data in \ncompliance with \nenterprise \ngovernance on \nlabeling/tagging \npolicy.  Machine enforceable \ndata access controls  \nare implemented.  \n \nAutomated tooling is \ncreated and \nimplemented to meet \nscaling demands and \nprovide better \naccuracy.  \n \n Data tagging and \nsupport is fully \nautomated.  \n \nContinuous analysis \nis employed to \nensure data is \nproperly tagged and \nlabeled, a nd \nautomation \nprocedures remedied \nas needed.  \nData monitoring and sensing  \nData should always be detectable and observable  by those who should have access to \nit and those who are required to manage it . Data metadata should be  observable for \ntracking and alerting , although sometimes only partially since metadata can have \nsensitivities and access controls . Data owners and automated  management solutions \nshould ensure all data has associated  metadata that includes current informat ion about \nthe access, sharing, transformatio n, and use of the data assets . This ensures  basic \nintegration with monitoring systems , and d ata owners with authorized access will make \ndecisions about  potential corruption or compromise . Organizations must have \nenforcement points in place to enable logging and policy enforcement . \nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools , which will be  discussed \nmore in the Visibility & Analytics  pillar, play a role in this capability , providing data \nowners with the ability to gather and analyze security data from information systems \nusing a single interface.  \nTable 4: Data monitoring and sensing maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nData owners \nidentify and \ncapture active Database \nmonitoring solutions \nare procured and File monitori ng tools are \nused to monitor all \nregulatory protected Logs and analytics \nfrom all the data \nmonitoring  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n9 Preparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nmetadata that \nprovide s insight \ninto access, \nsharing, \ntransformation, \nand use of data \nassets.  \n \nAnalysis is \nconducted to \ndetermine \nwhere tooling \nshould  be \ndeployed  for \nlogging and \nenforcement \npoints . \n \n \n implemented across \nall databas es \ncontaining regulated \ndata types (CUI, PII, \nPHI, etc.)  \n \nData file monitoring \ntools are utilized to \nmonitor critical data \nin applications, \nservices, and \nrepositories. \nAnalytics from \nmonitoring is fed \ninto the SIEM with \nbasic data \nattributes.  data in applications, \nservices, and \nrepositories. Extended \nintegration is used to \nsend data to  \nappropriate inter/intra -\npillar solutions , such as \nDLP,  \nDRM , and User & Entity \nBehavior  \nAnalytics.  \n \nData outside of DLP \nand DRM scope , such \nas file shares and \ndatabases , are actively \nmonitored for \nanomalous and \nmalicious activity using \nalternative tooling.  \n solution s are fed \ninto the SIEM for \nmonitoring and \nresponse. \nAnalytics  are fed \ninto cross pillar \nactivities to better \ninform  decision \nmaking.  \n \nAdditional data \nattributes to meet \nZT advanced \nfunctionalities are \nintegrated into \nanalytics.  \nData encryption and rights management  \nData encryption and rights management combines technology with policy to protect \ndata against unwanted access, modification, or redistribution. Data should be \nautomatically  encrypted based on data attributes assigned through tagging and labeling . \nBy encrypting the data, organizations  can be more as sured their data is protected even \nif it is exfiltrated or lost  as long as a malicious actor does not have the associated \ndecryption keys . For additional security or if encryption is impossible, other data controls \ncan be applied to protect data; this includes using DRM tools that prevent a user from \nforwarding, editing, saving, or printing data.  \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n10 Table 5: Data encryption and rights management maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganizations  \nestablish a \nstrategy for \nencrypting \ndata at rest \nand in transit \nfollowing \nenterprise \nstandards \nand \nrequirements . \n \n Encryption gaps are \nidentified; enterprise -\nmanaged devices \nand centralized key \nmanagement are \nemployed.  \n \nOrganizations \nprocure encryption \ntools as needed to \nimplement the data at \nrest and in transit \nencryption strategy.  \nInitial DRM \nimplementations are \nused to reduce data \nexposure outside of \nenterprise -managed \nsystems, focusing on \nprotecting critical \ndata in high-risk data \nrepositories.  \n Encryption \nkeys are \nautomatically \nmanaged.  \n \nAll data is \nencrypted \nacross the \nentire \nenterprise \nenvironment.  \n \nDRM is \nexpanded to all \nscoped data \nrepositories.  Data tags are integrated \nwith DRM ; data is \nautomatically  \nencrypted  at rest  based on \ndata tags . \n \nAdditional tags are created \nto protect extended data \nrepositories with DRM \nsolutions  designed to track \nand protect data . \n \nMachine learning models \nare used to detect and alert \non anomalous usage of \ndata. These models are \nintegr ated with encryption \nand DRM tools.  \n \nData loss prevention  \nData loss prevention (DLP)  is a security strategy focused on detecting  and preventi ng \ndata leakage o r loss through unauthorized use, exfiltration , or destruction . DLP tools \ndeployed only at a system boundary are inadequate to address corruption of data \nthroughout the system. Therefore, DLP tools are placed at identified enforcement points \nthroughout the architecture to detect and mitigate data breaches and exfiltrat ion. \nOrganizations must establish a baseline for data usage before enabling the prev ention \ncapabilities of DLP tools . When implemented correctly along with  the other capabilities \nof the data pillar , DLP tools , established throughout an organizations netwo rk and not \njust at the perimeter, can more reliably secure an organizations data.   \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n11 Insider threats can pose a great risk to an organization . Entities  with access to sensitive \ndata from within can leak, destroy, or steal that data , intentionally or uninten tionally.  As \nexamples, a  vexed former employee could steal data to sell to a competitor , or one \nmight accidentally leak sensitive data by using it in an AI tool, such as a large language \nmodel (LLM).  DLP can help stop the unauthorized forwarding, copying, or destr oying of \nsensitive data by tracking sensitive information within the network.  \nAmong other scenarios, e xternal threats can target data for exfiltration (theft), or use \nransomware to manipulate and destroy data to make it inaccessible to authorized users.  \nDLP can help prevent malicious cyber actors  from successfully obtaining or encrypting \ninternal data.  DLP is a proactive solution for protecting data , but there should still be a \nplan in place for data recovery should data loss occur in spite of thes e efforts due to \nhardware failure, ransomware, or other causes . \nTable 6: Data loss prevention maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganizations \nscope \nenforcement \npoints to \ndeploy DLP \nsolutions.  \n \nTechniques for \nidentifying \nsensitive data \nare \nestablished, \nsuch as key \nterms, \nfingerprints, \npattern \nmatching, and \nfile matching.  \n A DLP solution is \ndeployed to the in -\nscope  \nenforcement points. \nDLP solution is set to \nmonitor -only and/or  \nlearning mode  to \nlimit impact.  \n DLP solution results \nare anal yzed  \nand policy is fine -\ntuned to manage risk \nto an acceptable \nlevel.  \n \nThe DLP solution is \nupdated from \nmonitor mode to \nprevention mode. \nBasic manual data \ntags are utilized for \nthe DLP solution and \na logging schema is \nintegrated with \nmanual tags.  The DLP solution is \nupdated to integrate  \ndata tags based on \nparallel automation \nactivities  for data \ntagging . DLP data \nscope is extended, \nutilizing the \nautomated data tags \nto identify sensitive \ndata.  \n \nAutomated d ata \nmonitoring identif ies \nmissing enforcement \npoints for additional \nDLP deployment .  \n \n\n \n \n \n U/OO/ 140279 -24 | PP-24-1320  | APRIL  2024 Ver. 1.0  \nNSA | Advancing Zero Trust Maturity Throughout the Data Pillar  \n12 Data access control  \nData access control seeks to limit access to and use of data -based properties and \nattributes associated with the data and a user/device tuple  along with any other relevant \ninformation . This capability is dependent on the others and brings into  focus the ultimate \njob of the d ata pillar to e nforce granular access controls  and utilize all available data \nattributes for access decisions. This ensures unauthorized entities or entiti es on \nunauthorized device s cannot access the data. It also ensures those users and devices \nwith access to data will continue to have their attributes inspected  through various policy \ndecision and enforcements points within the architecture . \nThe data protec tion needs of organizations will differ, and organizations must decide \nhow they will use Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Policy Based Access Control \n(PBAC), Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), and other options to control access. \nOrganizations should mature through the phases as follows:  \nTable 7: Data access control maturity  \nPreparation  Basic  Intermediate  Advanced  \nOrganizational \npolicy is developed \nwith enterprise -\nwide central \nmanagement \nsolutions in mind.  \n \nEnsure appropriate \naccess to, and use \nof, data based on \nthe data and \nuser/NPE/device \nproperties.  \n \nA software defined \nstorage ( SDS) \npolicy and an \nenterprise Identity \nProvider (IdP) Central management  \nsolutions,  such as SDS \nand automation tools , are \nintegrated with \nestablished policy and \nDRM tooling in a phased \napproach to measure \nresults, improve \nprotections, and adjust \naccordingly.  \nPolicy Based Access \nControls (PBAC)  are \nestablished . PBACs \ninform data access \ndecisions using attributes \ndetermined by policy \nrules.  \n Attribute Based \nAccess Controls \n(ABAC) are \ndefined and \nestablished , \nensuring identity \nattributes \ncorrespond to \nappropriate data \nobjects.  \nRoles are defined \nand implemented \nensuring access \nto data dependent \non proper user \nroles within the \norganization.

Data is protected through effective cataloging, labeling, and encryption while at rest \nand in transit. ZT strategy is ultimately centered on protecting an organizations data  \nthrough constant verification , so it is important that data owners take the steps \nnecessary to survey their data to design and implement effective controls. Once in \nplace, those controls should be tested and the maturity evaluated. Implementing an \neffective data management plan within the ZT framework will limit d ata breaches, and if \na breach does occur, will provide the  necessary information on the assets that were \ncompromised to minimize the dama ge. \nFurther guidance  \nNSA is assisting DoD customers that are implementing  ZT capabilities, coordinating ZT \nactivities w ith NIST, CISA, NSS, and DoD, and developing additional ZT guidance to \nsupport system developers through the challenges of integrating ZT within NSS, DoD, \nand Defense Industrial Base (DIB) environments.
