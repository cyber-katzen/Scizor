Notable attack vectors include Trickbot and \nCobalt Strike (see below for details) .  \nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA, FBI, \nNSA, and the United States Secret Service (USSS)  encourage organizations to review this advisory \nand apply the recommended mitigations.  \n(end of update)  \nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) have observed the increased us e of Conti ransomware in more than 400 attacks on U.S. and \ninternational organizations. (See  FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare and First \nResponder Networks .) In typical Conti ransomware attacks, m alicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt \nservers and workstations, and demand a ransom payment.  Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to \nProtect Against Conti Ransomware \n Use multifactor authentication . \n Segment and segregate networks and \nfunctions.  \n Update your operating system  and \nsoftware. \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 2 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n To secure systems  against Conti  ransomware, CISA , FBI, and the National Security  Agency  (NSA) \nrecommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Advisory, which include requiring \nmultifactor authentication (MFA), implementing network segmentation, and keeping operating \nsystems and software up to date.  \nClick here  for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in STIX format.  \nNote : This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge \n(ATT&CK) framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise  for all referenced threat actor \ntactics and techniques . \nTECHNICAL DETAILS  \nWhile Conti is considered a ransomware-as -a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant, there is \nvariation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely that Conti developers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage of the proceeds \nfrom a successful attack.  \nConti actors often gain initial access [TA0001\n] to networks through:  \n Spearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments \n[T1566.001] or malicious links [ T1566.002 ]; \no Malicious Word attachments  often contain embedded scripts  that can be used to \ndownload or drop other malwaresuch as TrickBo t and IcedID , and/or Cobalt Strike\nto assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life c ycle with the \neventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware. [1],[2],[3] \n Stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [ T1078] ;[4] \n Phone calls;  \n Fake software promoted via search engine optimization; \n Other malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and \n Common vulnerabilities in external assets.  \nIn the execution phase [ TA0002 ], actors run a getuid payload before using a more aggressive \npayload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus  engines . CISA and FBI have  observed Conti actors \nusing Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for and brute force [ T1110 ] routers, \ncameras, and network -attached storage devices with web interfaces. Additionally, actor s use \nKerberos attacks [ T1558.003 ] to attempt to get the Admin hash to conduct brute force attacks.  \nConti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software and remote \ndesktop software as backdoors to maintain p ersistence [TA0003] on victim networks.[5 ] The actors \nuse tools already available on the victim network and, as needed, add additional tools  such as \nWindows Sysinternals  and Mimikatz to obtain users hashes and clear -text credentials , which \nenabl e the actors to escalate privileges [ TA0004 ] within a domain and perform other post-exploitation \nand lateral movement tasks  [TA0008 ]. In some cases , the actors also use TrickBot malware to carry \nout post-exploitation tasks . \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 3 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n According to a recently leaked threat actor pl aybook ,[6] Conti  actors also exploit vulnerabilities in \nunpatched assets , such as the following, to escalate privileges [ TA0004] and move laterally [ TA0008 ] \nacross a victims network : \n 2017 Microsoft Windows Server Message Block 1.0 server vulnerabilities;[7 ] \n \"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527)  in Windows Print spooler service;[ 8] and \n \"Zerologon\" vulnerability (CVE-2020- 1472)  in Microsoft Active D irectory Domain Controller \nsystems.[ 9] \nArtifacts  leaked with the playbook identify  four Cobalt Strike server Internet Protocol ( IP) addresses \nConti actors previously used  to communicate with their command and control ( C2) server . \n 162.244.80[.]235  \n 85.93.88[.]165  \n 185.141.63 [.]120 \n 82.118.21[.]1  \nCISA and FBI have observed Conti actors using different Cobalt Strike server IP addresses unique to \ndifferent victims .  \nConti actors often use the open-source Rclone command line program for data exfiltration [TA0010 ]. \nAfter the actors steal and encrypt the victim's sensitive data [T1486 ], they employ a double extortion \ntechnique in which they demand the victim pay a ransom for the release of the encrypt ed data and \nthreaten the victim with public release of the data if the ransom is not paid. \nINDICATORS OF COMPROMISE   \nUpdated March 9 , 2022: \nThe following domains have registration and naming characteristics similar to domains used by \ngroups that have distributed Conti ransomware. Many of these domains have been used in malici ous \noperations; however, some may be abandoned or may share similar characteristics coincidentally.  \nDomains \nbadiwaw[.]com  \nbalacif[.]com  \nbarovur[.]com  \nbasisem[.]com  \nbimafu[.]com  \nbujoke[.]com  \nbuloxo[.]com  \nbumoyez[.]com  \nbupula[.]com  fipoleb[.]com  \nfofudir[.]com  \nfulujam[.]com  \nganobaz[.]com  \ngerepa[.]com  \ngucunug[.]com \nguvafe[.]com  \nhakakor[.]com  \nhejalij[ .]com  kipitep[.]com  \nkirute[.]com  \nkogasiv[.]com  \nkozoheh[.]com  \nkuxizi[.]com  \nkuyeguh[.]com  \nlipozi[.]com  \nlujecuk[.]com  \nmasaxoc[.]com  pihafi[.]com  \npilagop[.]com  \npipipub[.]com  \npofifa[.]com  \nradezig[.]com  \nraferif[.]com  \nragojel[.]com  \nrexagi[.]com  \nrimurik[.]com  tiyuzub[.]com  \ntubaho[.]com  \nvafici[.]com  \nvegubu[.]com  \nvigave[.]com  \nvipeced[.]com  \nvizosi[.]com  \nvojefe[.]com  \nvonavu[.]com  \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 4 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n cajeti[.]com  \ncilomum[.]com  \ncodasal[.]com  \ncomecal[.]com  \ndawasab[.]com  \nderotin[.]com  \ndihata[.]com  \ndirupun[.]com  \ndohigu[.]com  \ndubacaj[.]com  \nfecotis[.]com  hepide[.]com  \nhesovaw[.]com  \nhewecas[.]com  \nhidusi[.]com  \nhireja[.]com  \nhoguyum[.]com  \njecubat[.]com  \njegufe[.]com  \njoxinu[.]com  \nkelowuh[.]com  \nkidukes[.]com  mebonux[.]com  \nmihojip[.]com  \nmodasum[.]com  \nmoduwoj[.]com  \nmovufa[.]com  \nnagahox[.]com  \nnawusem[.]com  \nnerapo[.]com  \nnewiro[.]com  \npaxobuy[.]com  \npazovet[.]com  rinutov[.]com  \nrusoti[.]com  \nsazoya[.]com  \nsidevot[.]com  \nsolobiv[.]com  \nsufebul[.]com  \nsuhuhow[.]com  \nsujaxa[.]com  \ntafobi[.]com \ntepiwo[.]com  \ntifiru[.]com  wezeriw[.]com  \nwideri[.]com  \nwudepen[.]com  \nwuluxo[.]com  \nwuvehus[.]com  \nwuvici[.]com  \nwuvidi[.]com  \nxegogiv[.]com  \nxekezix[.]com  \n(End of update)  \nMITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES  \nConti ransomware  uses the ATT&CK techniques listed in table 1.  \nTable 1: Conti  ATT&CK techniques for enterprise  \nInitial Access  \nTechnique Title  ID Use \nValid Accounts  T1078  Conti actors have been observed gaining \nunauthorized access to victim networks \nthrough stolen Remote Desktop Protocol \n(RDP ) credentials.  \nPhishing: Spearphishing \nAttachment  T1566.001  Conti ransomware can be delivered using \nTrickBot malware, which is known to use an \nemail with an Excel sheet containing a \nmalicious macro to deploy the malware. \nPhishing: Spearphishing \nLink  T1566.002  Conti ransomware can be delivered using \nTrickBot , which  has been delivered via \nmalicious links in phishing emails. \nExecution  \nCommand and Scripting \nInterpreter: Windows \nCommand Shell  T1059.003  Conti ransomware can utilize command line \noptions to allow an attacker control over how it scans and encrypts files.  \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 5 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n Native Application \nProgramming Interface \n(API)  T1106  Conti  ransomware has used API calls during \nexecution.  \nPersistence  \nValid Accounts  T1078  Conti actors have been observed gaining \nunauthorized access to victim networks \nthrough stolen RDP credentials.  \nExternal Remote Services  T1133  Adversaries may leverage external -facing \nremote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services \nsuch as virtual private networks ( VPNs ), Citrix, \nand other access mechanisms allow users to \nconnect to internal enterprise network  \nresources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage \nconnections and credential authentication for \nthese services. Services such as Windows \nRemote Management can also be used \nexternally.  \nPrivilege Escalation  \nProcess Injection: Dynamic -\nlink Library Injection  T1055.001  Conti ransomware has loaded an encrypted \ndynamic -link library  (DLL ) into memory and \nthen executes it.  \nDefense Evasion  \nObfuscated Files or \nInformation  T1027  Conti ransomware has encrypted DLLs and \nused obfuscation to hide Windows API calls.  \nProcess Injection: Dynamic -\nlink Library Injection  T1055.001  Conti  ransomware has loaded an encrypted \nDLL into memory and then executes it. \nDeobfuscate/Decode Files \nor Information  T1140  Conti ransomware has decrypted its payload \nusing a hardcoded AES -256 key.  \nCredential Access  \nBrute Force T1110  Conti actors use legitimate tools to maliciously \nscan for and brute force routers, cameras, and \nnetwork -attached storage devices with web \ninterfaces.  \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 6 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n Steal or Forge Kerberos \nTickets: Kerberoasting  T1558.003  Conti actors use Kerberos attacks to attempt to get the Admin hash.  \nDiscovery  \nSystem Network \nConfiguration Discovery  T1016  Conti ransomware can retrieve the ARP cache \nfrom the local sys tem by using the \nGetIpNetTable() API call and check to \nensure IP addresses it connects to are for \nlocal, non -internet systems.  \nSystem Network Connections Discovery  T1049\n Conti  ransomware can enumerate routine \nnetwork connections from a compromised \nhost.  \nProcess Discovery  T1057  Conti ransomware can enumerate through all \nopen processes to search for any that have \nthe string sql  in their process name.  \nFile and Directory \nDiscovery  T1083  Conti  ransomware can discover files on a local \nsystem.  \nNetwork Share Discovery  T1135  Conti ransomware can enumerate remote \nopen server message block ( SMB ) network \nshares using NetShareEnum().  \nLateral Movement   \nRemote Services: SMB/Windows Admin \nShares  \n T1021.002\n Conti  ransomware can spread via SMB and \nencrypts files on different hosts, potentially \ncompromising an entire network. \nTaint Shared Content T1080  Conti ransomware can spread itself by \ninfecting other remote machines via network \nshared drives. \nImpact  \nData Encrypted for Impact T1486  Conti ransomware can use \nCreateIoCompletionPort(), \nPostQueuedCompletionStatus(), and \nGetQueuedCompletionPort() to rapidly \nencrypt files, excluding those with the \nextensions of .exe,  .dll , and .lnk.

Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated \ncommunication between networks.  \n Filter network traffic  to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known malicious IP \naddresses.  \n Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. Implement a \nuser training  program to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening \nmalicious attachments. Filter emails containing executable files to pr event them from reaching \nend users.  \n Implement a URL blocklist and/or allowlist to prevent users from accessing malicious websites.  \nScan for vulnerabilities  and keep software updated .  \n Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans  of network assets using up-to-\ndate signatures .  \n Upgrade software and operating systems, applications, and firmware on network assets  in a \ntimely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management system.  \nRemove unnece ssary applications  and apply controls . \n Remove any application not deemed necessary for day -to-day operations. Conti threat actors \nleverage legitimate applications such as remote monitoring and management software and key that is unique for each victim. Conti  \nransomware  can use \"Windows Restart \nManager\" to ensure files are unlocked and \nopen for encryption.  \nService Stop  T1489  Conti ransomware can stop up to 146 \nWindows services related to security, backup, \ndatabase, and email solutions through the use \nof net stop.  \nInhibit System Recovery  T1490  Conti ransomware can delete Windows \nVolume Shadow Copies using vssadmin.  \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 8 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n remote desktop software applications to aid in the malicious exploitation of an organizations \nenterprise.  \n Investigate any unauthorized software, particularly remote desktop or remote monitoring and \nmanagement software. \n Implement application allowlisting,  which only allows systems to execute programs known and \npermitted by the organization's security policy. Implement software restriction policies (SRPs) \nor other controls to prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations, \nsuch as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers or \ncompression/decompression programs. \n Implement execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files \ntransmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files \ntransmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.  \n See the joint Alert, Publicly Available Tools Seen in Cyber Incidents Worldwide developed by \nCISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United \nKingdom for guidance on detection and protection against malicious use of publicly available \ntools.  \nImplement endpoint and  detection response tools.  \n Endpoint and detection response tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security status \nof endpoints and can help effective ly protect against malicious  cyber actors.   \nLimit access to resources over  the network , especially by restricting RDP.  \n After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating \nsources and require multifactor authentication.  \nSecure user accounts. \n Regularly audit administrative user accounts and configure acc ess controls under the \nprinciples of least privilege and separation of duties. \n Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.  \nReview CISAs APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers  guidance for additional mitigations \nspecific to IT Service Providers and their customers. \nUse the Ransomware Response Checklist in case of infection.  \nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA , FBI, and NSA  recommend the following \nactions : \n Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA -Multi -State Information \nSharing and Analysis Center (MS -ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide . \n Scan your backups. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. \n\n \n  CISA  | FBI | NSA  | USSS  \n TLP: WHITE  \n \nPage 9 of 10  |  Product ID : AA21 -265A  \nTLP: WHITE  \n  Report incidents immediately to CISA at https://us -cert.cisa.gov/report, a local FBI Field \nOffice , or U.S. Secret Service Field Office .  \n Apply incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory , Tech nical Approaches \nto Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity , developed by CISA and the cybersecurity \nauthorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom . \nCISA , FBI, and NSA  strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may \nembolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in \nthe distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not \nguarantee that a victims files will be recovered.  \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES \n The Digital Forensics, Incident Response ( DFIR ) Report: BazarLoader to Conti Ransomware \nin 32 Hours  (September 2021): https://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader -to-conti -\nransomware -in-32-hours/  \n NSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Transition to Multi -Factor Authentication (August 2019): \nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multi -\nfactor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf   \n NSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Segment  Networks and Deploy Application-Aware \nDefenses (September 2019): https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180325/-1/-\n1/0/Segment%20Networks%20and%20Deploy%20Application%20Aware%20Defenses%20-\n%20Copy.pdf   \n NSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Hardening Network Devices (August 2020): \nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/18/2002479461/-1/-\n1/0/HARDENING_NETWORK_DEVICES.PDF   \nFree Cyber Hygiene Services  \nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services  to help organizations assess, identify , and \nreduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.
