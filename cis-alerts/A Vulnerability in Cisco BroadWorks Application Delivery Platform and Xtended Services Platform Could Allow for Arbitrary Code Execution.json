Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform is an enterprise-grade calling and collaboration platform that integrates with Cisco Webex to meet the full range of enterprise communications and collaboration needs. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform releases prior to AP.platform.23.0.1075.ap385341Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform releases prior to AP.platform.23.0.1075.ap385341RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform which could allow for Arbitrary Code Execution. Details of this vulnerability are as follows\nTactic: Execution (TA0041):\nTechnique: Native Code (T1575), Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):\n\nCisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to forge the credentials required to access an affected system and allow execution of commands at the privilege level of the forged account. (CVE-2023-20238)\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the administrator account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by CISCO to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.6: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Externally-Exposed Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. Perform scans on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\n\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \n\nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\n\n\n\nUse two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. (M1032: Multi-factor Authentication) \n\nSafeguard 6.5: Require MFA for Administrative Access: Require MFA for all administrative access accounts, where supported, on all enterprise assets, whether managed on-site or through a third-party provider.\n\n\n\nUse intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. (M1031: Network Intrusion Prevention) \n\nSafeguard 13.3: Deploy a Network Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a network intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or equivalent cloud service provider (CSP) service.\nSafeguard 13.8: Deploy a Network Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a network intrusion prevention solution, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) or equivalent CSP service.\n\n\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection)\n\nSafeguard 13.10:  Performing Application Layer Filtering:  Perform application layer filtering. Example implementations include a filtering proxy, application layer firewall, or gateway.\n\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20238Ciscohttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-auth-bypass-kCggMWhXGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
