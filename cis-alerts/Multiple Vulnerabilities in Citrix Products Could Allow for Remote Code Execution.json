Citrix ADC performs application-specific traffic analysis to intelligently distribute, optimize, and secure Layer 4 - Layer 7 network traffic for web applications. Citrix Gateway is used to consolidate remote access infrastructure and provide single sign-on across all applications whether in a data center, in a cloud, or if the apps are delivered as SaaS apps. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:Citrix have advised in their security bulletin that exploitation of CVE-2023-3519 against vulnerable appliances has been observed in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:NetScaler ADC\u202fand NetScaler Gateway prior to 13.1-49.13  and later releasesNetScaler ADC\u202fand NetScaler Gateway prior to 13.0-91.13 \u202fand later releases of 13.0\u202fNetScaler ADC prior to 13.1-FIPS 13.1-37.159 and later releases of 13.1-FIPSNetScaler ADC prior to 12.1-FIPS 12.1-55.297 and later releases of 12.1-FIPS\u202fNetScaler ADC prior to 12.1-NDcPP 12.1-55.297 and later releases of 12.1-NDcPPRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Citrix products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows:\nTactic: Execution (TA0002)\nTechnique: Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):\n\nCVE-2023-3519: Unauthenticated remote code execution\nDetails of lower-severity vulnerabilities are as follows:\nCVE-2023-3466: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \nPrerequisite : Requires victim to access an attacker-controlled link in the browser while being on a network with connectivity to the NSIP      \nCVE-2023-3467: Privilege Escalation to root administrator (nsroot) \nPrerequisite : Authenticated access to NSIP or SNIP with management interface access\nSuccessful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote compromise by the user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by Citrix to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\nSafeguard 9.1: Ensure Use of Only Fully Supported Browsers and Email Clients: Ensure only fully supported browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the enterprise, only using the latest version of browsers and email clients provided through the vendor.\nRestrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system. (M1048: Application Isolation and Sandboxing)\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \nSafeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \nSafeguard 10.5: Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nInform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \nSafeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3466https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3467https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3519Citrixhttps://support.citrix.com/article/CTX561482/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve20233519-cve20233466-cve20233467Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.27.20242024-106: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PHP Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory09.27.20242024-105: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MorePress Release09.19.2024CIS Releases Results of 18 Month Study of U.S. Tribal Organization CybersecurityRead MoreWhite Paper09.18.2024DMARC Guide: Microsoft 365 and Google WorkspaceRead More",
