(CVE-2024-23531)\nA Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability in WLAvalancheService component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3 allows an authenticated remote attacker to perform denial of service attacks. (CVE-2024-24991, CVE-2024-27978)\nA Path Traversal vulnerability in web component of Ivanti Avalanche before 6.4.3 allows a remote authenticated attacker to delete specific type of files and/or cause denial of service. (CVE-2024-27984)\nSuccessful exploitation could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by Ivanti to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \nSafeguard 7.1 : Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process: Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.5 : Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\nSafeguard 12.1: Ensure Network Infrastructure is Up-to-Date: Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support.\nSafeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program: Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements.\nSafeguard 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests: Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.\nSafeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\nSafeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently.\nVulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning) \nSafeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) \nSafeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \nSafeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-22061https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23526https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23527https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23528https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23529https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23530https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23531https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23533https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23532https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23534https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23535https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24991https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24992https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24993https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24994https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24995https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24996https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24997https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24998https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24999https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25000https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27975https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27976https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27977https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27978https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27984https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29204Ivantihttps://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Avalanche-6-4-3-Security-Hardening-and-CVEs-addressed?language=en_USGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.03.20242024-094: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreWhite Paper08.29.2024The CIS Security Operations Center (SOC): The Key to Growing Your SLTT's Cyber MaturityRead MoreAdvisory08.24.20242024-093: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SolarWinds Web Help Desk Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post08.14.2024The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): A Quest for Data ControlRead More",
