Foxit PDF Reader is a multilingual freemium PDF tool that can create, view, edit, digitally sign, and print PDF files. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:2024.2.3.25184 and earlier versions for Windows.2024.2.3.25184 and all previous 2024.x versions for Windows.2023.3.0.23028 and all previous 2023.x versions for Windows.13.1.3.22478 and all previous 13.x versions for Windows.12.1.7.15526 and all previous 12.x versions for Windows.11.2.10.53951 and earlier versions for Windows.2024.2.3.64402 and all previous 2024.x versions for macOS.2023.3.0.63083 and all previous 2023.x versions for macOS.13.1.2.62201 and all previous 13.x versions for macOS.12.1.5.55449 and all previous 12.x versions for macOS.11.1.9.0524 and earlier versions for macOS.2024.2.2.64388 and earlier versions for macOS.RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor, the most severe of which could result in arbitrary code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows:\u00a0\u00a0Tactic: Execution (TA0002):Technique: User Execution: Malicious File (T1204.002):The application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects, Annotation objects, or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code or disclose information. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript, or fails to correctly update the font cache after deleting a page. (CVE-2024-28888, CVE-2024-7725)The application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability when performing an update or installing a plugin, which attackers could exploit to delete arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code so as to carry out privilege escalation attacks. This occurs due to the incorrect permission assignment on the resources used by the update service, improper signature validation and incomplete certificate check for the updater, weak randomness setting for the name of the temporary folder during a plugin installation, or improper DLL loading without using the built-in manifest file. (CVE-2024-38393)The application could be exposed to an Out-of-Bounds Read/Write vulnerability and crash when parsing certain PDF files or handling certain Annotation objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application reads or writes data beyond the boundaries of an allocated object or buffer. (NO CVE ASSIGNED)\u00a0Details of lower-severity vulnerabilities are as follows:The application could be exposed to a Side-Loading vulnerability when performing an update, which attackers could exploit to run malicious payloads by replacing the update file with a malicious one. This occurs as the application fails to validate the integrity of the updater when running the update service. (CVE-2024-41605)The application could be exposed to a Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability and crash when scrolling certain PDF files with an abnormal StructTreeRoot dictionary entry, which attackers could exploit to launch a Denial of Service attack. This occurs due to the use of a null pointer without proper validation. (NO CVE ASSIGNED)A potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability during the deactivation or uninstallation if the application is reinstalled without prior uninstallation, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs due to the inadequate permission setting for the /usr/local/share/foxit folder used during the installation so that low-privilege attackers can easily tamper with the script files in the directory. (NO CVE ASSIGNED)\u00a0Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:Apply appropriate updates provided by Foxit to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051:\u00a0Update Software)Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets.
