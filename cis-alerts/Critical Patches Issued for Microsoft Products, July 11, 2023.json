Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.\nJuly 12 - UPDATED THREAT INTELLIGENCE:\nThere have been five vulnerabilities within Microsoft's critical patches that have been exploited in the wild. The CVEs are CVE-2023-32046, CVE-2023-32049, CVE-2023-35311, CVE-2023-36874, and CVE-2023-36884.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:.NET and Visual StudioASP.NET and .NETAzure Active DirectoryMicrosoft DynamicsMicrosoft Graphics ComponentMicrosoft Media-Wiki ExtensionsMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft Office AccessMicrosoft Office ExcelMicrosoft Office OutlookMicrosoft Office Share-PointMicrosoft Power AppsMicrosoft Printer DriversMicrosoft Windows Codecs LibraryMono AuthenticodePaint 3DRole: DNS ServerService FabricVisual Studio CodeWindows Active Directory Certificate ServicesWindows Active Template LibraryWindows Admin CenterWindows App StoreWindows Authentication MethodsWindows CDP User ComponentsWindows CNG Key Isolation ServiceWindows CertificatesWindows Clip ServiceWindows Cloud Files Mini Filter DriverWindows Cluster ServerWindows Common Log File System DriverWindows Connected User Experiences and TelemetryWindows Crypto-APIWindows Cryptographic ServicesWindows DefenderWindows Deployment ServicesWindows EFI PartitionWindows Error ReportingWindows Failover ClusterWindows Geolocation ServiceWindows HTTP.sysWindows Image AcquisitionWindows InstallerWindows KernelWindows Layer 2 Tunneling ProtocolWindows Layer2 Bridge Network DriverWindows Local Security Authority (LSA)Windows MSHTML PlatformWindows MediaWindows Message QueuingWindows NT OS KernelWindows NetlogonWindows Network Load BalancingWindows ODBC DriverWindows OLEWindows Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP Snap-In)Windows PGMWindows Partition Management DriverWindows Peer Name Resolution ProtocolWindows Print Spooler ComponentsWindows Remote DesktopWindows Remote Procedure CallWindows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)Windows SPNEGO Extended NegotiationWindows Server Update ServiceWindows Smart-ScreenWindows Transaction ManagerWindows Update Orchestrator ServiceWindows VOLSNAP.SYSWindows Volume Shadow CopyWindows Win32KRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution.\nA full list of all vulnerabilities can be found at the link below:\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide \nSuccessful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\nJuly 12 - UPDATED TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\nMicrosoft has not released any patches for CVE-2023-36884. However, Microsoft has provided mitigation guidance that can be used to avoid exploitation. The provided guidance can be found below:\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36884#mitigations\nRECOMMENDATIONS:RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nApply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by Microsoft to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services, and run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\n\n\nRemind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links/open files provided by unknown or untrusted sources. (M1017: User Training)\no   Safeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\n\n\nUse capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior. (M1040 : Behavior Prevention on Endpoint)\no   Safeguard 13.2 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.\no   Safeguard 13.7 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. Example implementations include use of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) client or host-based IPS agent.\n\nREFERENCES:July 12 - UPDATED REFERENCEShttps://www.tenable.com/blog/microsofts-july-2023-patch-tuesday-addresses-130-cves-cve-2023-36884Microsofthttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2023-JulGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.14.2024The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): A Quest for Data ControlRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-091: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Adobe Products Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-090: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Products Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read More",
