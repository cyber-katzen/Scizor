Telerik Report Server provides centralized management for Progress\u2019 business intelligence reporting suite through a web application. Successful chain exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Services whose accounts are configured to have fewer rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:According to open source reports, a proof-of-concept was posted on GitHub. There are currently no other reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Progress Telerik Report Server versions prior to 2024 Q2 (10.1.24.514)RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Progress Telerik Report Server, which could allow for remote code execution. First, an adversary would create a user with \u201cSystem Administrator\u201d privileges by calling a unauthenticated .NET method. Once they gain access to the server using said account, the adversary can manipulate serialized objects. When Telerik\u2019s custom deserializer runs to create reports, their malicious code will be passed and executed. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows:\nTactic: Initial Access (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):\n\nAuthentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2024-4358)\nInsecure Deserialization Vulnerability (CVE-2024-1800)\n\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Services whose accounts are configured to have fewer rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by Progress to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\no   Safeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\no   Safeguard 9.1: Ensure Use of Only Fully Supported Browsers and Email Clients: Ensure only fully supported browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the enterprise, only using the latest version of browsers and email clients provided through the vendor.\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\no   Safeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently.\n\n\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation)\no   Safeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\no   Safeguard 12.8: Establish and Maintain Dedicated Computing Resources for All Administrative Work: Establish and maintain dedicated computing resources, either physically or logically separated, for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring administrative access. The computing resources should be segmented from the enterprise's primary network and not be allowed internet access.\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1800https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4358News Outletshttps://securityaffairs.com/164114/hacking/progress-telerik-report-servers-poc.htmlhttps://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/06/04/cve-2024-4358-cve-2024-1800-pochttps://thehackernews.com/2024/06/telerik-report-server-flaw-could-let.htmlProgresshttps://docs.telerik.com/report-server/knowledge-base/deserialization-vulnerability-cve-2024-1800https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/knowledge-base/registration-auth-bypass-cve-2024-4358Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
