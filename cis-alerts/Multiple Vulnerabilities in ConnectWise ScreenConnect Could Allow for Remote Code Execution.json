ConnectWise ScreenConnect is ConnectWise's remote desktop and mobile support solutions to allow technicians to perform remote support, gain remote access and run remote meetings. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are reports that the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-1709) is considered to be trivially exploitable, and proof-of-concept exploits are already available.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:ScreenConnect versions prior to 23.9.8RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentHIGHBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesHIGHHome Users:HIGHTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ConnectWise ScreenConnect, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows \nTactic: Initial Access (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190): \n\nScreenConnect 23.9.7 and prior are affected by a path-traversal vulnerability, which may allow an attacker the ability to execute remote code or directly impact confidential data or critical systems. (CVE-2024-1708) \nScreenConnect 23.9.7 and prior are affected by an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability, which may allow an attacker direct access to confidential information or critical systems. (CVE-2024-1709)\nSuccessful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken: \n\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by ConnectWise to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\nSafeguard 7.1 : Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. \nSafeguard 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process: Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews. \nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis. \nSafeguard 7.5 : Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. \nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process. \nSafeguard 12.1: Ensure Network Infrastructure is Up-to-Date: Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support. \nSafeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program: Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements. \nSafeguard 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests: Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box. \nSafeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\n\n\n\nVulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning) \n\nSafeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\n\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \n\nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable. \nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account. \nSafeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently\n\n\n\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) \n\nSafeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\n\n\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \n\nSafeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122. \n\n\n\nRestrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. (M1021: Restrict Web-Based Content) \n\nSafeguard 9.2: Use DNS Filtering Services: Use DNS filtering services on all enterprise assets to block access to known malicious domains. \nSafeguard 9.3: Maintain and Enforce Network-Based URL Filters: Enforce and update network-based URL filters to limit an enterprise asset from connecting to potentially malicious or unapproved websites. Example implementations include category-based filtering, reputation-based filtering, or through the use of block lists. Enforce filters for all enterprise assets. \nSafeguard 9.6: Block Unnecessary File Types: Block unnecessary file types attempting to enter the enterprise\u2019s email gateway. \n\n\n\nRemind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \n\nSafeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. \nSafeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\n\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2024-1708https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-1709ConnectWisehttps://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
