Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile is a mobile management software engine that enables IT to set policies for mobile devices, applications and content. If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially accessing users\u2019 personally identifiable information such as names and phone numbers. Additionally, the attacker can potentially make configuration changes to the server, including creating an administrative account that can make further changes to a vulnerable system.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:According to Ivanti, the exploitation of CVE-2023-35078 has been observed in a small number of customers (less than 10).SYSTEMS AFFECTED:EPMM version 11.10EPMM version 11.9EPMM version 11.8EPMM Unsupported and End of Life versionsRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesMEDIUMSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesMEDIUMSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability has been discovered in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile which could allow for unauthorized access to specific API paths. Details of this vulnerability are as follows:\nTactic: Initial Access (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):\n\nRemote Unauthenticated API Access Vulnerability. (CVE-2023-35078)\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to API paths, enabling an unauthenticated attacker to access users' personally identifiable information. Additionally, it may allow them to make configuration changes to the server, potentially creating an administrative account that can make further changes to a vulnerable system.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by Ivanti to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1 : Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process: Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\no   Safeguard 7.5 : Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\no   Safeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\no   Safeguard 12.1: Ensure Network Infrastructure is Up-to-Date: Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support.\no   Safeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program: Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements.\no   Safeguard 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests: Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.\no   Safeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\nVulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning)\no   Safeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\no   Safeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation)\no   Safeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection)\no   Safeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-35078Ivantihttps://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-35078-Remote-unauthenticated-API-access-vulnerability?language=en_USGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
