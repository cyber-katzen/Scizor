The vulnerabilities, if exploited could allow unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on Fortinet products. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the affected service/user account. Depending on the privileges associated with the account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:FortiClientEMS 7.2.0 through 7.2.2FortiClientEMS 7.0.0 through 7.0.10FortiClientEMS 6.4 all versionsFortiClientEMS 6.2 all versionsFortiClientEMS 6.0 all versionsFortiOS version 7.4.0 through 7.4.1FortiOS version 7.2.0 through 7.2.6FortiOS version 7.0.0 through 7.0.13FortiOS version 6.4.0 through 6.4.14FortiOS version 6.2.0 through 6.2.15FortiProxy version 7.4.0 through 7.4.2FortiProxy version 7.2.0 through 7.2.8FortiProxy version 7.0.0 through 7.0.14FortiProxy version 2.0.0 through 2.0.13FortiManager version 7.4.0FortiManager version 7.2.0 through 7.2.3FortiManager version 7.0.0 through 7.0.10FortiManager version 6.4.0 through 6.4.13FortiManager 6.2 all versionsRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Fortinet has released security updates to address multiple vulnerabilities found in Fortinet products. The vulnerabilities, if exploited could allow unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on Fortinet products.. Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows:\nTactic: Initial Access (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):\n\n\nAn improper access control vulnerability in FortiWLM MEA for FortiManager may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specifically crafted requests. (CVE-2023-36554) \n\n\nAn improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV File vulnerability in FortiClientEMS may allow a remote and unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the admin workstation via creating malicious log entries with crafted requests to the server. (CVE-2023-47534)\n\n\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability and a Stack-based Buffer Overflow in FortiOS & FortiProxy captive portal may allow an inside attacker who has access to captive portal to execute arbitrary code or commands via specially crafted HTTP requests. (CVE-2023-42789 & CVE-2023-42790)\n\n\nAn improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in FortiClientEMS may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted requests. (CVE-2023-48788)\n\n\nAn authorization bypass through user-controlled key vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy SSLVPN may allow an authenticated attacker to gain access to another user\u2019s bookmark via URL manipulation. (CVE-2024-23112)\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the affected service/user account. Depending on the privileges associated with the account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by Fortinet to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\n\nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. \n\n\nSafeguard 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process: Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews. \n\n\nSafeguard 7.3: Perform Automated Operating System Patch Management: Perform operating system updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis \n\n\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis. \n\n\nSafeguard 7.6: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Externally-Exposed Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. Perform scans on a monthly, or more frequent, basis. \n\n\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process. \n\n\nSafeguard 12.1: Ensure Network Infrastructure is Up-to-Date: Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support. \n\n\nSafeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program: Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements. \n\n\nSafeguard 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests: Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box. \n\n\nSafeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\n\n\nVulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning) \n\n\nSafeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \n\n\nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable. \n\n\nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account. \n\n\nSafeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently. \n\n\nSafeguard 6.8: Define and Maintain Role-Based Access Control: Define and maintain role-based access control, through determining and documenting the access rights necessary for each role within the enterprise to successfully carry out its assigned duties. Perform access control reviews of enterprise assets to validate that all privileges are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum annually, or more frequently.\n\n\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) \n\n\nSafeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\n\n\nRestrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system. (M1048: Application Isolation and Sandboxing) \n\n\nSafeguard 16.8: Separate Production and Non-Production Systems: Maintain separate environments for production and non-production systems.\n\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \n\n\nSafeguard 13.10:  Performing Application Layer Filtering:  Perform application layer filtering. Example implementations include a filtering proxy, application layer firewall, or gateway.\n\n\nInform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \n\n\nSafeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. \n\n\nSafeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-36554https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-47534https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42789https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42790https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-48788https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23112Fortinethttps://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-23-103https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-23-328https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-23-390https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-007https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-013Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.14.2024The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): A Quest for Data ControlRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-091: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Adobe Products Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-090: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Products Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read More",
