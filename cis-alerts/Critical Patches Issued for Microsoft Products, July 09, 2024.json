Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are no reports that these vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild.\n**July 22 \u2013 UPDATED THREAT INTELLIGENCE\nTrend Micro reports the MHTML remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2024-38112 was used as part of an attack chain by the advanced persistent threat (APT) group Void Banshee, which targets North American, European, and Southeast Asian regions for information theft and financial gain. The final payload of this zero-day attack chain is the Atlantida stealer, which was first discovered in January 2024. Variations of the Atlantida campaign have been highly active throughout 2024 and have evolved to use CVE-2024-38112 as part of Void Banshee infection chains.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:SQLServerWindows CoreMessagingWindows Secure BootWindows MultiPoint ServicesMicrosoft DynamicsWindows Remote Access Connection ManagerWindows NTLMWindows Cryptographic Services.NET and Visual StudioMicrosoft Office SharePointAzure Network WatcherAzure DevOpsWindows iSCSIWindows Server BackupWindows Remote DesktopWindows Message QueuingWindows Performance MonitorMicrosoft Office OutlookMicrosoft OfficeWindows Image AcquisitionLine Printer Daemon Service (LPD)Windows ThemesWindows Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)XBox Crypto Graphic ServicesWindows PowerShellWindows FilteringWindows KernelWindows DHCP ServerNDISWindows Distributed Transaction CoordinatorWindows Workstation ServiceMicrosoft Graphics ComponentMicrosoft Streaming ServiceWindows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)Microsoft Windows Codecs LibraryWindows BitLockerWindows Win32K - ICOMPActive Directory Certificate ServicesActive Directory Domain ServicesWindows Kernel-Mode DriversWindows TCP/IPWindows Win32K - GRFXWindows Enroll EngineWindows LockDown Policy (WLDP)Windows Remote Desktop Licensing ServiceActive Directory Federation ServicesRole: Windows Hyper-VWindows Win32 Kernel SubsystemAzure Kinect SDKMicrosoft Defender for IoTMicrosoft WS-DiscoveryAzure CycleCloudWindows COM SessionWindows Fax and Scan ServiceWindows MSHTML PlatformRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. \nA full list of all vulnerabilities can be found in the Microsoft link in the References section.\nSuccessful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by Microsoft to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services, and run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \n\nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\n\nRemind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links/open files provided by unknown or untrusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \n\nSafeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\n\nUse capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior. (M1040: Behavior Prevention on Endpoint) \n\nSafeguard 13.2: Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.\nSafeguard 13.7: Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. Example implementations include use of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) client or host-based IPS agent.\n\nREFERENCES:Microsofthttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2024-JulTrend Microhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/g/CVE-2024-38112-void-banshee.htmlGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
