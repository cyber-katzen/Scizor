MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer software that allows the enterprise to securely transfer files between business partners and customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rightsTHREAT INTELLIGENCE:There is threat intelligence of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:MOVEit Transfer prior to 2023.0.1MOVEit Transfer prior to 2022.1.5MOVEit Transfer prior to 2022.0.4MOVEit Transfer prior to 2021.1.4MOVEit Transfer prior to 2021.0.6RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer that could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment. Details of this vulnerability are as follows:\nTactic: Initial Access (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):\n\nThe vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw that allows for escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access on target systems.\nTactic: Execution (TA0041):\nTechnique: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):\nRapid7 analyzed a sample webshell payload associated with successful exploitation. The webshell code would first determine if the inbound request contained a header named X-siLock-Comment, and would return a 404 \"Not Found\" error if the header was not populated with a specific password-like value. As of June 1, 2023, all instances of Rapid7-observed MOVEit Transfer exploitation involve the presence of the file human2.aspx in the wwwroot folder of the MOVEit install directory (human.aspx is the native aspx file used by MOVEit for the web interface).\nSuccessful exploitation allows attackers to download and steal sensitive information such as list of stored files, usernames who uploaded the files, file paths, configured Azure Blob Storage accounts, data from Azure Blob Storage containers, data from servers, and so on. The attackers can also insert and delete a new random named MOVEit Transfer user with the login name 'Health Check Service' and create new MySQL sessions. Progress Software is advising MOVEit customers to check for indicators of unauthorized access over \u201cat least the past 30 days\u201d, as well as other remediation recommendations.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:In addition to Progress remediation recommendations, we recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nEnsure your MOVEit application is receiving and applying updates, definitions, and security patches and mitigations recommended by Progress.

Review monthly, or more frequently.\n\n\nSafeguard 2.5: Allowlist Authorized Software: Use technical controls, such as application allowlisting, to ensure that only authorized software can execute or be accessed. Reassessbi-annually, or more frequently.\n\n\nSafeguard 2.7: Allowlist Authorized Scripts: Use technical controls, such as digital signatures and version control, to ensure that only authorized scripts, such as specific .ps1, .py, etc., files, are allowed to execute. Block unauthorized scripts from executing. Reassessbi-annually, or more frequently.\n\n\nSafeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process: Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and servers) and software (operating systems and applications).
