Cisco Unity Connection is a unified messaging and voicemail solution that allows users access and manage messages from an email inbox, web browser, Cisco Jabber, Cisco Unified IP Phone, smartphone, or tablet. Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system and execute commands on the underlying operating system. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Cisco Unity Connection Releases prior to 12.5.1.19017-4Cisco Unity Connection Releases prior to 14.0.1.14006-5RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco Unity Connection that could allow for arbitrary code execution.\nTactic: Credential Access (TA0006):\nTechnique: Unsecured Credentials (T1552):\n\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system and execute commands on the underlying operating system. (CVE-2024-20272)\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system and execute commands on the underlying operating system. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate patches provided by Cisco to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\no   Safeguard 7.5: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\nBlock execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. (M1038: Execution Prevention)\no   Safeguard 2.5 : Allowlist Authorized Software: Use technical controls, such as application allowlisting, to ensure that only authorized software can execute or be accessed. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently.\no   Safeguard 2.6 : Allowlist Authorized Libraries: Use technical controls to ensure that only authorized software libraries, such as specific .dll, .ocx, .so, etc., files, are allowed to load into a system process. Block unauthorized libraries from loading into a system process. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently.\no   Safeguard 2.7 : Allowlist Authorized Scripts: Use technical controls, such as digital signatures and version control, to ensure that only authorized scripts, such as specific .ps1, .py, etc., files, are allowed to execute. Block unauthorized scripts from executing. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently.\nRemove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries. (M1042: Disable or Remove Feature or Program) \nSafeguard 2.3: Address Unauthorized Software: Ensure that unauthorized software is either removed from use on enterprise assets or receives a documented exception. Review monthly, or more frequently.\nSafeguard 2.5: Allowlist Authorized Software: Use technical controls, such as application allowlisting, to ensure that only authorized software can execute or be accessed. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently.\nSafeguard 2.7: Allowlist Authorized Scripts: Use technical controls, such as digital signatures and version control, to ensure that only authorized scripts, such as specific .ps1, .py, etc., files, are allowed to execute. Block unauthorized scripts from executing. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently.\nSafeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process: Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 4.8: Uninstall or Disable Unnecessary Services on Enterprise Assets and Software: Uninstall or disable unnecessary services on enterprise assets and software, such as an unused file sharing service, web application module, or service function.\nSafeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\nSafeguard 18.5: Perform Periodic Internal Penetration Tests: Perform periodic internal penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20272Ciscohttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cuc-unauth-afu-FROYsCsDGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.14.2024The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): A Quest for Data ControlRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-091: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Adobe Products Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-090: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Products Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read More",
