Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate updates and workarounds provided by Fortinet to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\nBlock execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. (M1038: Execution Prevention) \nSafeguard 2.5: Use technical controls, such as application allowlisting, to ensure that only authorized software can execute or be accessed.\nSafeguard 2.7: Use technical controls, such as digital signatures and version control, to ensure that only authorized scripts, such as specific .ps1, .py, etc., files are allowed to execute. Block unauthorized scripts from executing.\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\nRestrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system. (M1048: Application Isolation and Sandboxing) \nSafeguard 4.1:  Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process:  Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 16.8:  Separate Production and Non-Production Systems:  Maintain separate environments for production and non-production systems.\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \nSafeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nSafeguard 13.10:  Performing Application Layer Filtering:  Perform application layer filtering. Example implementations include a filtering proxy, application layer firewall, or gateway.\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) \nSafeguard 3.12: Segment Data Processing and Storage Based on Sensitivity: Segment data processing and storage based on the sensitivity of the data. Do not process sensitive data on enterprise assets intended for lower sensitivity data.\nSafeguard 4.4: Implement and Manage a Firewall on Servers: Implement and manage a firewall on servers, where supported. Example implementations include a virtual firewall, operating system firewall, or a third-party firewall agent.\nSafeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\nSafeguard 12.8: Establish and Maintain Dedicated Computing Resources for All Administrative Work: Establish and maintain dedicated computing resources, either physically or logically separated, for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring administrative access. The computing resources should be segmented from the enterprise's primary network and not be allowed internet access.\nSafeguard 16.8: Separate Production and Non-Production Systems: Maintain separate environments for production and non-production systems.\nInform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. Remind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \nSafeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42756https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42761https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43074https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33871https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40683https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22636https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23777https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23778https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23779https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23780https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23781https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23782https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23783https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23784https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25602https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30299https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30300https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30303Fortinethttps://www.fortiguard.com/psirt?date=02-2023&product=FortiWebGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.14.2024The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): A Quest for Data ControlRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-091: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Adobe Products Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory08.13.20242024-090: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Products Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read More",
