Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for privilege escalation. Depending on the privileges associated with the exploited component, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Android OS patch levels prior to 2023-04-05RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected component.

Depending on the privileges associated with the exploited component, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full rights.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate patches provided by Google to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\no   Safeguard 7.5: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\nRemind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments, especially from un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training) \nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection)\no   Safeguard 10.5: Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0872https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0873https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0874https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0875https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0876https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0878https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0879https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0880https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0881https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0882https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0883https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0884https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0885https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-4696https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-20463https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-20471https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32599https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33231https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33269https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33270https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33288https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33289https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33302https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33917https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36449https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-38181https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40503https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40532https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41757https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42716https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47335https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47336https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47337https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47338https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20652https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20653https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20654https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20655https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20656https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20657https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20909https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20935https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20941https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20950https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20967https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21080https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21081https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21082https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21083https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21084https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21085https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21086https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21087https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21087https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21088https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21089https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21090https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21090https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21091https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21092https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21093https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21093https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21094https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21096https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21097https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21098https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21099https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21100https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21630Googlehttps://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-04-01Get
