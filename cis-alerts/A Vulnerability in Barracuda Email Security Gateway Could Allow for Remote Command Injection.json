Barracuda Email Security Gateway is an email security gateway that manages and filters all inbound and outbound email traffic to protect organizations from email-borne threats and data leaks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server in the context of the System user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:Barracuda has stated CVE-2023-2868 has been used to impact ESG appliances as early as October 2022. Barracuda has identified a subset of appliances where CVE-2023-2868 was utilized to obtain unauthorized access, deploy backdoors, and deploy malware. Barracuda notified affected customers via the ESG user interface of actions to take and reached out to those specific customers. Finally, Barracuda deployed two patches to remediate the vulnerability which were applied to all ESG appliances worldwide.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Barracuda Email Security Gateway (appliance form factor only) versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A Vulnerability has been discovered in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) which could allow for remote code injection. Details of this vulnerability are as follows:\nTactic: Execution (TA0041):\nTechnique: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):\n\nThe vulnerability stemmed from incomplete input validation of user supplied .tar files as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. Consequently, a remote attacker could format file names in a particular manner that would result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product. (CVE-2023-2868)\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server in the context of the System user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nEnsure your ESG appliance is receiving and applying updates, definitions, and security patches from Barracuda. Contact Barracuda support ([email\u00a0protected]) to validate if the appliance is up to date.
