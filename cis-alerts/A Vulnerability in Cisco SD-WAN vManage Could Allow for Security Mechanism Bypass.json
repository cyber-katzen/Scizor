Cisco SD-WAN vManage is a centralized network management console for controlling, configuring and monitoring devices in a network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass security mechanisms on the targeted host, granting them to gain read permissions or limited write permissions to the configuration of an affected Cisco SD-WAN vManage instance.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.10Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.11Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.6.3.3Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.6.4Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.6.5Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.7Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.8Cisco SDWAN v-Manage 20.9RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentHIGHBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesHIGHHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability has been discovered in Cisco SD-WAN vManage which could allow for security mechanism bypass. Details of this vulnerability are as follows\nTactic: Execution (TA0041):\n Technique: Native Code (T1575), Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):\n\nA vulnerability in Cisco's SD-WAN vManage could allow an attacker to bypass security mechanisms on the targeted host. The vulnerability lies in the design of SD-WAN vManage, specifically within the REST API, where requests are not adequately validated. (CVE-2023-20214)\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass security mechanisms on the targeted host, granting them to gain read permissions or limited write permissions to the configuration of an affected Cisco SD-WAN vManage instance.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\n\nApply appropriate patches provided by Cisco to vulnerable systems, immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\n\nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\n\n\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\n\n\nSafeguard 7.5: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\n\n\nVulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning) \n\n\nSafeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\n\n\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) \n\n\nSafeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\n\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \n\n\nSafeguard 10.5: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20214Ciscohttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-unauthapi-sphCLYPAVulDBhttps://vuldb.com/?id.233901Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Related ResourcesCiscoInformation HubAdvisories See All Advisories Blog Post08.09.2024Top 10 Malware Q2 2024Read MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-088: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Privilege EscalationRead MoreAdvisory08.07.20242024-087: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MoreBlog Post07.26.2024CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social EngineeringRead More",
