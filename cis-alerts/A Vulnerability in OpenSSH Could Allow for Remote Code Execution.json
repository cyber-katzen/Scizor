OpenSSH is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the SSH protocol and is crucial for secure communication over unsecured networks. It is widely used in enterprise environments for remote server management, secure file transfers, and various DevOps practices. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the administrator account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:OpenSSH versions earlier than 4.4p1 (unless patched for CVE-2006-5051 and CVE-2008-4109)OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 up to, but not including, 9.8p1RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:A vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSH, which could allow for remote code execution. Details of the vulnerability ilncude: \nTactic: Initial Access  (TA0001):\nTechnique: Exploit Public-Facing Application  (T1190):\n\nA Race condition vulnerability exists in sshd(8), which could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution in OpenSSH\u2019s server (sshd) that grants full root access. It affects the default configuration and does not require user interaction. It poses a significant exploit risk. (CVE-2024-6387)\nRECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate updates provided by OpenSSH to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) \n\nSafeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nSafeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.6: Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Externally-Exposed Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. Perform scans on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nSafeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) \n\nSafeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\nSafeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\n\nPrevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc. (M1035: Limit Access to Resource Over Network)\nUse intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. (M1031: Network Intrusion Prevention) \n\nSafeguard 13.3: Deploy a Network Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a network intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or equivalent cloud service provider (CSP) service.\nSafeguard 13.8: Deploy a Network Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a network intrusion prevention solution, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) or equivalent CSP service.\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) \n\nSafeguard 13.10:  Performing Application Layer Filtering:  Perform application layer filtering. Example implementations include a filtering proxy, application layer firewall, or gateway.\n\nREFERENCES:CVEhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387OpenSSHhttps://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.htmlQualyshttps://www.qualys.com/regresshion-cve-2024-6387/Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Related ResourcesOpenSSHInformation HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.27.20242024-106: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PHP Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory09.27.20242024-105: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MorePress Release09.19.2024CIS Releases Results of 18 Month Study of U.S. Tribal Organization CybersecurityRead MoreWhite Paper09.18.2024DMARC Guide: Microsoft 365 and Google WorkspaceRead More",
