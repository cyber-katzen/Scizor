Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:There are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:SQL ServerWindows Security Zone MappingWindows InstallerMicrosoft Office SharePointWindows TCP/IPWindows PowerShellWindows Network Address Translation (NAT)Azure Network WatcherAzure Web AppsAzure StackWindows Mark of the Web (MOTW)Dynamics Business CentralMicrosoft Office PublisherWindows Standards-Based Storage Management ServiceWindows Remote Desktop Licensing ServiceWindows Network VirtualizationRole: Windows Hyper-VWindows DHCP ServerMicrosoft Streaming ServiceWindows KerberosWindows Remote Access Connection ManagerWindows Win32K - GRFXMicrosoft Graphics ComponentWindows StorageWindows Win32K - ICOMPWindows Authentication MethodsWindows Kernel-Mode DriversWindows AllJoyn APIMicrosoft Management ConsoleWindows Setup and DeploymentWindows MSHTML PlatformMicrosoft Office VisioMicrosoft Office ExcelAzure CycleCloudWindows Admin CenterMicrosoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises)Power AutomateMicrosoft Outlook for iOSWindows UpdateMicrosoft AutoUpdate (MAU)RISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. A full list of all vulnerabilities can be found in the Microsoft link in the References section.Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:Apply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by Microsoft to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management:\u00a0Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services, and run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software:\u00a0Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts:\u00a0Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.Remind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links/open files provided by unknown or untrusted sources. (M1017: User Training) Safeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program:\u00a0Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.Safeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks:\u00a0Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.Use capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior. (M1040 : Behavior Prevention on Endpoint) Safeguard 13.2 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.Safeguard 13.7 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. Example implementations include use of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) client or host-based IPS agent.REFERENCES:Microsofthttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2024-SepGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Related ResourcesMicrosoft SQL ServerMicrosoft Windows DesktopMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft AzureMIT KerberosInformation HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.27.20242024-106: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PHP Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory09.27.20242024-105: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MorePress Release09.19.2024CIS Releases Results of 18 Month Study of U.S. Tribal Organization CybersecurityRead MoreWhite Paper09.18.2024DMARC Guide: Microsoft 365 and Google WorkspaceRead More",
