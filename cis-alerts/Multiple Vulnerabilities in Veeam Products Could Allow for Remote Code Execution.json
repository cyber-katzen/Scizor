Details of these vulnerabilities are as follows:Tactic:\u00a0Initial Access (TA0001):Technique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):A vulnerability allowing unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). (CVE-2024-40711)A series of related high-severity vulnerabilities, the most notable enabling remote code execution (RCE) as the service account and extraction of sensitive information (saved credentials and passwords). Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires a user who has been assigned a low-privileged role within Veeam Backup & Replication. (CVE-2024-40710)A vulnerability that allows an attacker in possession of the Veeam ONE Agent service account credentials to perform remote code execution on the machine where the Veeam ONE Agent is installed. (CVE-2024-42024)A vulnerability that allows low-privileged users to execute code with Administrator privileges remotely. (CVE-2024-42023)A vulnerability that permits a low-privileged user to upload arbitrary files to the server, leading to remote code execution on VSPC server. (CVE-2024-39714)A vulnerability that allows a low-privileged user with REST API access granted to remotely upload arbitrary files to the VSPC server using REST API, leading to remote code execution on VSPC server. (CVE-2024-39715)\u202fA vulnerability that permits a low-privileged user to overwrite files on that VSPC server, which can lead to remote code execution on VSPC server. (CVE-2024-38651)Additional lower severity vulnerabilities include:A vulnerability that allows a user who has been assigned a low-privileged role within Veeam Backup & Replication to alter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) settings and bypass MFA. (CVE-2024-40713)A vulnerability that allows a low-privileged user to remotely remove files on the system with permissions equivalent to those of the service account. (CVE-2024-39718)A vulnerability in TLS certificate validation allows an attacker on the same network to intercept sensitive credentials during restore operations. (CVE-2024-40714)A path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker with a low-privileged account and local access to the system to\u202fperform local privilege escalation (LPE). (CVE-2024-40712)A vulnerability that allows a local low-privileged user on the machine to escalate their privileges to root level. (CVE-2024-40709)A vulnerability that allows an attacker to access the NTLM hash of the Veeam Reporter Service service account. This attack requires user interaction and data collected from Veeam Backup & Replication. (CVE-2024-42019)A vulnerability that allows an attacker with valid access tokens to access saved credentials. (CVE-2024-42021)A vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify product configuration files. (CVE-2024-42022)\u202fA vulnerability in Reporter Widgets that allows HTML injection. (CVE-2024-42020)A vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker to access the NTLM hash of service account on the VSPC server. (CVE-2024-38650)A vulnerability that allows a low-privileged user to perform local privilege escalation through exploiting an SSRF vulnerability. (CVE-2024-40718)Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:Apply appropriate updates provided by Veeam to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software) Safeguard 7.1 : Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.Safeguard 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process: Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews.Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.Safeguard 7.5 : Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.Safeguard 7.7: Remediate Detected Vulnerabilities: Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.Safeguard 12.1: Ensure Network Infrastructure is Up-to-Date: Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support.Safeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program: Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements.Safeguard 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests: Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.Safeguard 18.3: Remediate Penetration Test Findings: Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise\u2019s policy for remediation scope and prioritization.\u00a0Apply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management) Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software:\u00a0Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.Safeguard 5.5: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Accounts: Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently.\u00a0Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them. (M1016: Vulnerability Scanning) Safeguard 16.13: Conduct Application Penetration Testing: Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.\u00a0Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems. (M1030: Network Segmentation) Safeguard 12.2: Establish and Maintain a Secure Network Architecture: Establish and maintain a secure network architecture. A secure network architecture must address segmentation, least privilege, and availability, at a minimum.\u00a0Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection) Safeguard 10.5:\u00a0Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.REFERENCES:CVEhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-38650http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-38651http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39714http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39715http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39718http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40709http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40710http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40711http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40712http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40713http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40714http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40718http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42019http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42020http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42021http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42022http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42023http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-42024Veeamhttps://www.veeam.com/kb4649Get Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.27.20242024-106: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PHP Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory09.27.20242024-105: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MorePress Release09.19.2024CIS Releases Results of 18 Month Study of U.S. Tribal Organization CybersecurityRead MoreWhite Paper09.18.2024DMARC Guide: Microsoft 365 and Google WorkspaceRead More",
