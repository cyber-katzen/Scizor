(M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1 : Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\no   Safeguard 7.5 : Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets: Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool.\n\n\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services. Run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative privileges) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\n\n\nUse capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring. (M1050: Exploit Protection)\no   Safeguard 10.5:  Enable Anti-Exploitation Features: Enable anti-exploitation features on enterprise assets and software, where possible, such as Microsoft\u00ae Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Windows\u00ae Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG), or Apple\u00ae System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Gatekeeper\u2122.\n\n\nRestrict use of certain websites, block downloads/attachments, block Javascript, restrict browser extensions, etc. (M1021: Restrict Web-Based Content)\no   Safeguard 9.2: Use DNS Filtering Services: Use DNS filtering services on all enterprise assets to block access to known malicious domains.\no   Safeguard 9.3: Maintain and Enforce Network-Based URL Filters: Enforce and update network-based URL filters to limit an enterprise asset from connecting to potentially malicious or unapproved websites. Example implementations include category-based filtering, reputation-based filtering, or through the use of block lists. Enforce filters for all enterprise assets.\no   Safeguard 9.6: Block Unnecessary File Types: Block unnecessary file types attempting to enter the enterprise\u2019s email gateway.\n\n\nRemind users not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources. Inform and educate users regarding the threats posed by hypertext links contained in emails or attachments especially from un-trusted sources. (M1017: User Training)\no   Safeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\n\nREFERENCES:ADOBEhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security.htmlAdobehttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb23-17.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb23-18.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb23-19.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/dimension/apsb23-20.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/creative-cloud/apsb23-21.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_stager/apsb23-22.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb23-23.htmlhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb23-25.htmlCVEhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21615http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21616http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22247http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22249http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22250http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22251http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22252http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22253http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22254http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22256http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22257http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22258http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22259http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22260http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22261http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22262http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22263http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22264http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22265http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22266http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22269http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22271http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25690http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25859http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25860http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25861http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25862http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25863http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25864http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25865http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25866http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25867http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25868http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25869http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25870http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25871http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25872http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25873http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25874http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25875http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25876http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25877http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25878http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25879http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25880http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25881http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25882http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25883http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25884http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25885http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25886http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25887http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25888http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25889http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25890http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25891http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25892http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25893http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25894http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25895http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25896http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25897http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25898http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25899http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25900http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25901http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25902http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25903http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25904http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25905http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25906http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25907http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-20
