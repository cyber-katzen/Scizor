Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.THREAT INTELLIGENCE:Microsoft has reported that CVE-2023-36761 and CVE-2023-36802 have been exploited in the wild.SYSTEMS AFFECTED:.NET and Visual Studio.NET Core & Visual Studio.NET Framework3D Builder3D ViewerAzure DevOpsAzure HDInsightsMicrosoft Azure Kubernetes ServiceMicrosoft DynamicsMicrosoft Dynamics Finance & OperationsMicrosoft Exchange ServerMicrosoft Identity Linux BrokerMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft Office ExcelMicrosoft Office OutlookMicrosoft Office SharePointMicrosoft Office WordMicrosoft Streaming ServiceMicrosoft Windows Codecs LibraryVisual StudioVisual Studio CodeWindows Cloud Files Mini Filter DriverWindows Common Log File System DriverWindows DefenderWindows DHCP ServerWindows GDIWindows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)Windows KernelWindows ScriptingWindows TCP/IPWindows ThemesRISK:Government:Large and medium government entitiesHIGHSmall governmentMEDIUMBusinesses:Large and medium business entitiesHIGHSmall business entitiesMEDIUMHome Users:LOWTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution.\nA full list of all vulnerabilities can be found at the link below:\nhttps://learn.cisecurity.org/e/799323/ate-guide-releaseNote-2023-Sep/4t6dv4/1254977988?h=i8AOCpvPIa3ioBy71cpUzSd7jqbaIkG7OWAXHP-CFAQ\nSuccessful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.RECOMMENDATIONS:We recommend the following actions be taken:\n\nApply appropriate patches or appropriate mitigations provided by Microsoft to vulnerable systems immediately after appropriate testing. (M1051: Update Software)\no   Safeguard 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process: Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 7.4: Perform Automated Application Patch Management: Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.\nApply the Principle of Least Privilege to all systems and services, and run all software as a non-privileged user (one without administrative rights) to diminish the effects of a successful attack. (M1026: Privileged Account Management)\no   Safeguard 4.7: Manage Default Accounts on Enterprise Assets and Software: Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable.\no   Safeguard 5.4: Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user\u2019s primary, non-privileged account.\nRemind all users not to visit untrusted websites or follow links/open files provided by unknown or untrusted sources. (M1017: User Training)\no   Safeguard 14.1: Establish and Maintain a Security Awareness Program: Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise\u2019s workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\no   Safeguard 14.2: Train Workforce Members to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks: Train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.\nUse capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior. (M1040 : Behavior Prevention on Endpoint)\no   Safeguard 13.2 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Detection Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.\no   Safeguard 13.7 : Deploy a Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Solution: Deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. Example implementations include use of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) client or host-based IPS agent.\nREFERENCES:Microsofthttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2023-SepGet Email Updates When Cyber Threats Like This Arise Subscribe to Advisories Information HubAdvisories See All Advisories Advisory09.27.20242024-106: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PHP Could Allow for Remote Code ExecutionRead MoreAdvisory09.27.20242024-105: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Foxit PDF Reader and Editor Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionRead MorePress Release09.19.2024CIS Releases Results of 18 Month Study of U.S. Tribal Organization CybersecurityRead MoreWhite Paper09.18.2024DMARC Guide: Microsoft 365 and Google WorkspaceRead More",
